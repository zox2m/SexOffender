27705,1i62irn,post,I have no life. I've completely given up on myself,"I'm 33F and I literally have no life and no future. I've dropped out of school and self-isolated myself when I was a teen then wasted all my 20s struggling with crippling social anxiety, panic attacks, anorexia and depression and barely leaving my house.

I grew up in a rather dysfunctional family, there was neglect and a lot of emotional abuse towards me and my brother. My brother has social anxiety too and struggled a lot with making friends at school, but he eventually managed to get his life together, got a job and his own family. But I seem to be perpetually stuck in this cycle. I've never really learned how to be an adult, I feel like my emotional maturity has stayed at teenager's level. I've never really had any serious relationships, never had a job. And the worst of it is that I don't really want anything. I don't see a purpose in even trying and to be honest I don't know how. I feel absolutely maladaptive and stupid, not worth anything good in this life.

Honestly, I've never thought I'd even last as long as I did. But what stops me from ending my life are my pets. I just can't think about what would happen to them when I'm gone. In this country where I live there's literally no shelters for animals and they will just get killed. So, I can say that I'm staying alive only for them.

Usually, I'm not one for pity parties. I prefer to stay quiet and don't talk much, especially about my life, because I'm very ashamed of how much of a failure I am. Just wanted to be vulnerable for once, but to be honest talking about it makes it sound even more pathetic than it feels. And sorry for my English, it's not my native language.  


Edit: Thank you all so much for your kind words and support, I didn't expect it at all. Sorry if I can't reply to everything, but I'm reading every message and it means a lot to me 🧡  
If I'm not responding to chat requests, it is because I'm insecure and a bit overwhelmed, please don't be offended, I'm not ignoring anyone on purpose.","I have no life.

27728,m88rib0,comment,,"Ask your child how they can “bring it to life” when you see their work. Recommend you think it would be good inspiration for them “to do something with it”. 

This isn’t invalidating and acknowledges the potential behind the pieces they come up with. Ask them what they think the final products would look like after they’ve added their own human touch. They will envision what their own style might look like once applied. You want to tickle the curiosity in a way that fuels the imagination. Wonder is the very engine of life. 

Sidenote: I’ve created art with ai and plagiarism is not inherent in the way that ai functions. Especially with the more and more that you prompt it with your own ideas. I feel confident that you misunderstand it because you aren’t the one working with it. 

Also keep in mind:
One thing to note is that physical mediums may not be their preference. It is not up to you to decide which medium is worthy, when the purpose behind lots of artists work is to satisfy the drive to create. In due time, they will learn to use those skills for the sake of expression. 

For example, I was always a great writer, now after graduation I use my talent for poetry and songwriting when at my lowest and the last time I showed somebody one of my songs it brought tears to their eyes, but most of the music I make is for the sake of chasing an idea down it’s rabbithole. So…

You can’t force creativity or even direct it, moreso than continue to nurture it and foster an environment that’s conducive to it. 

So here’s a recommendation: Try getting them an ipad and protools and photoshop with a stylus and you might be very surprised."," Ask your child how they can “bring it to life” when you see their work. Recommend you think it would be good inspiration for them “to do something with it”. 

This isn’t invalidating and acknowledges the potential behind the pieces they come up with. Ask them what they think the final products would look like after they’ve added their own human touch. They will envision what their own style might look like once applied. You want to tickle the curiosity in a way that fuels the imagination. Wonder is the very engine of life. 

Sidenote: I’ve created art with ai and plagiarism is not inherent in the way that ai functions. Especially with the more and more that you prompt it with your own ideas. I feel confident that you misunderstand it because you aren’t the one working with it. 

Also keep in mind:
One thing to note is that physical mediums may not be their preference. It is not up to you to decide which medium is worthy, when the purpose behind lots of artists work is to satisfy the drive to create. In due time, they will learn to use those skills for the sake of expression.

27787,m891tfc,comment,,"From your post it seems to me like you might have grown up with one or two narcissistic parents, if that's not the case then please ignore this answer. 

However if it's the case, you should watch Dr.Ramani on youtube. She's a specialist on how to survive and overcome narcissistic abusive relationship, regardless of it is romantic relationship or trauma from one or more narcissistic parents. 

Here's a small extract from Wikipedia just so you won't think she's a random youtuber: Ramani Suryakantham Durvasula is an American clinical psychologist, retired[2] professor of psychology, media expert, and author.

I've learned so much about myself and my broken upbringing, more than I've learned any other place, and she's given me hundreds of aha moments about stuff I didn't even realize were an issue. 

She takes on all kind of subjects regarding narcissism, a lot of it is about romantic relationships, but a lot of it is about narcissistic parents too, the impact on people are usually similar regardless of who the abusive person is.

It can help you understand how the way you react is actually typical for that experience, you can learn why our minds and bodies react this way and also how to break free from the trauma and how to start healing, because you can heal but you may need to understand why you have these fears/emotions before you can do that.

Of course, you can get this help also from professionals close to where you live, but as I understand it not every therapist is an expert in this field so you should search for someone who is an expert on narcissistic abuse.

There's no reason for you to not get help, you deserve everything you want from life exactly as much as every other living being do, because your worth lays in being you, and not what you do, don't do or your past experiences. I wish you the best❤️"," From your post it seems to me like you might have grown up with one or two narcissistic parents, if that's not the case then please ignore this answer.

There is a lot more to explore than you yet know brother.  Depression is a trickster don’t fall for those lies. There is another day ahead that wants you in it.

I’m very glad you reached out here.  I’m confident you can climb your way to peace.  You will be there for others who feel down as you do now.  Your journey matters.  

You have a purpose. This darkness you feel now can be used to help others someday. It’s hard going, but it can build empathy and wisdom too.

27840,m89e0uw,comment,,"I was in a similar situation. I was fighting my depression for the longest time of my life. I feel much better today, there are still many things that I struggle with but I don't ever want to go back. 

You answered to someone you didn't have a hard past, it's more about avoiding pain. But if your past wasn't hard, why would you avoid pain? where would this pain even come from?   
Let's not forget what you said already, that you grew up in a dysfunctional family with neglect and emotional abuse. If that's not hard, I don't know what is. You were a child, you couldn't really defend yourself, you didn't choose that life, you were born into this family, you couldn't escape that life. THAT IS HARD!  
You might really feel and think that way, but once you face your past you will realize that there is a lot of trauma.   
It's this trauma, probably in combination with other things that caused your situation to come to this point. You didn't choose this. You couldn't change it. THIS IS NOT YOUR FAULT !!! You are a victim of the circumstances, of others and of not knowing any better. You are just human. 

The main issue I see is your depression. It's causing you to feel like nothing matters. It's probably stopping you from taking action, which is the most important step for you to do if you want to improve your situation.

There are 2 things you have to do. 

1. Review your past.  
This is why having a Therapist is so important. You can try to do it alone, but it's hard. You have to find the right questions and you need to find a new perspective on what happened. It's much, much easier to do this with another person. However another person can only help to guide you, they can't do the hard work for you.

What you can do is to write down your past for yourself, slowly, take your time with that. Write down your life, everything that happened, every feeling that you have while thinking back and every thought that comes to mind. Allow your feelings to come up. Do this at your own pace, slowly, no matter how slowly. This is not a competition, not a goal to accomplish, you do this for yourself and it takes time and courage to face your past.

2. Reinvent yourself.  
The second part is to create a new mindset. You choose who you are and what you want to believe in. This second part might be much more work than it seems. And this too takes time. Reinventing yourself only works after making space by throwing out some thrash of your past. You changed over time and most of those changes just happened, but you do have the power to choose who you want to be now.

There can be many things in between. For example food can have a huge impact on anxiety, depression and other problems. So does exercise.  
There are many things that seem to be unrelated but they can actually have a huge impact on how we feel and think, on how much energy we have. Small and slow changes can also have a huge impact, change doesn't have to be this big thing that needs a ton of effort and seems impossible. Just try to do small steps. No matter how small, every step is a small victory! Even if it's just getting out of bed to survive another day.

You are not a failure! As humans we are rather complex, both our body and our mind need the right balance and it's incredible hard to regain this balance. There are many factors to it, we don't have control over all of them.

   
Thank you for sharing and for being vulnerable! You are not alone with struggles like this and they are not your fault! Nor is it your faul to be stuck. But it's your responsibility to yourself to take action now and get the help you need. To avoid more pain, you have to face the pain of your past and present, so that you can then change the course your life takes.

 This was about close to 30 years ago now but I once had a girlfriend, friend with benefits whatever it was.

This apparently happens to others and 2. There's a solution so others don't have to experience loss and limitations in their intimate lives.

Loneliness is just another part of life. A painful part where you can learn a lot about yourself because when you do get busy you will miss having time to yourself. 
So you have made an important step by reaching out for help and there really are some people who will want to help you and be friends. Be careful and let them.

Nuclear explosions in stars, colliding of rocks, quadrillions of organisms, hundreds of millions of years of evolution. And it all led to you. You have the incredibly rare opportunity to appreciate the craziness of existence and your consciousness in the first place. Just sit and ponder this for 5 minutes alone, really let it sink in.

Yeah your life might suck. Yeah you might be lonely and sad.

But. Existence itself…you’ve won the LOTTERY in this universe. You have a brain and a body. You have thoughts. You have eyes, ears, a voice. You have the power to interact with this universe. Even if you contribute nothing, you’ve been blessed with the ability to perceive your surroundings.

You’ve won the lottery, like me and many others. Let’s just sit back and enjoy!

It doesn’t matter if you’re a failure, or successful, or single, or in a relationship, or tall or short, fat or skinny, boring or vibrant, or anything.

You’ve already won 99% of everything you could possibly win in this universe. The remaining 1%…it’s just for fun.

So don’t be shortsighted. Life is a game, and some people are bad at it. Maybe you are. I am bad at some parts, good in others. Let’s just enjoy the game as much as we can, even if we lose. Even if nobody cares about us, even if we fail at everything we ever try. We still won 99% already.

And if you feel lonely, think of me, a guy who felt exactly like you a few years ago."," in this vast universe, over billions of years, the most insane story ever told happened.

It sounds like you've acquired a lifetime of self-affirming hatred and that takes time to dismantle. Getting better is a day-by-day struggle, which will be difficult, but not impossible.

27923,m89uewh,comment,,"Hey, I just want to say that it took a lot of courage to write this. You’re carrying so much pain but the fact that you’re still here, even when it feels hopeless, speaks volumes about your strength, whether you realize it or not.

First, I want you to know you’re not alone in feeling this way. A lot of people struggle with feeling stuck, especially after dealing with trauma and mental health challenges for so long. It doesn’t make you a failure, it makes you human. And your past doesn’t have to dictate your future.

I know the idea of change might feel impossible or overwhelming right now, but it doesn’t have to be all or nothing. Start with something small, maybe looking into online support groups or resources in your area, or even talking to a professional if that feels manageable. You don’t have to have all the answers today but little by little, those small steps can add up.

Also, the love you have for your pets is so meaningful. You’re showing that you’re capable of caring deeply, even when you’re hurting. That’s not the sign of someone who’s a failure; it’s the sign of someone who has value and love to give.

You’re not pathetic for feeling this way and you’re not alone in this. You’ve taken an important step by opening up here and I hope you can hold onto even a tiny bit of hope that things can get better. There are people rooting for you, even if it’s strangers on the internet. Please keep going, you deserve a chance at finding peace and joy, no matter how far away it feels right now."," Hey, I just want to say that it took a lot of courage to write this. You’re carrying so much pain but the fact that you’re still here, even when it feels hopeless, speaks volumes about your strength, whether you realize it or not.

First, I want you to know you’re not alone in feeling this way. A lot of people struggle with feeling stuck, especially after dealing with trauma and mental health challenges for so long. It doesn’t make you a failure, it makes you human. And your past doesn’t have to dictate your future.

I know the idea of change might feel impossible or overwhelming right now, but it doesn’t have to be all or nothing. Start with something small, maybe looking into online support groups or resources in your area, or even talking to a professional if that feels manageable. You don’t have to have all the answers today but little by little, those small steps can add up.

Also, the love you have for your pets is so meaningful. You’re showing that you’re capable of caring deeply, even when you’re hurting. That’s not the sign of someone who’s a failure; it’s the sign of someone who has value and love to give.

You’re not pathetic for feeling this way and you’re not alone in this. You’ve taken an important step by opening up here and I hope you can hold onto even a tiny bit of hope that things can get better. There are people rooting for you, even if it’s strangers on the internet.

You can’t expect to turn every single aspect around in a day, a week, a month. Take baby steps and find things that make you happy.

Most importantly, find little things that make you happy and occupy your time efficiently. Start going for walks in the sun, exercise, journal, read, puzzles, join a club.

As an introvert I refer to these as dating myself. Going out alone sucks, but mentally rethinking the time as getting to know myself has helped. 

Also I feel like December and January birthdays are cursed because of the holiday break and resolutions.

It hit me that we really didn’t have a lot in common anymore which hurts (they are still a good friend but the slight miscommunication hit me). Not a birthday celebration person in general, similar to the reasons you mentioned in your OP. 

Dreading turning 30 this year because it would be nice to plan something with friends, but I have already blocked out most optimal outcomes. Birthdays are hard, but I hope a close friend would at least be conscious of the date range. 

My adult take is I have 11 months until December to focus on friends and relations that bring me joy. This is not the year to waste time on dead ends (not bad people but I’m not holding myself back anymore). Life is too short guessing other people. 

I tell myself “it’s just a bad moment, not a bad life.” It’s cliche, but short and as much as I end up saying it, I hope to transform my inner thoughts and make the choices to the point of repeating it as much.

27950,m89yko4,comment,,"Yeah I understand. The reason people are so supportive is that life is hard and many have similar experiences. 

It took me a very long time to understand that I need to be more kind to myself, because I really didn't know better, couldn't change it. The thing is that there are many thing you need to know when you want to change and no one is teaching you those things. No one. The internet makes it easier to connect and talking about our struggles sometimes helps to find out about the things we need to change or that we can do. 

I make art and depression was always holding me back from creating but in the last few years when i was mostly free of depression, i also noticed it affected my perspective and my ability to understand certain things. If I simplify this, depression kept me stuck and dumb. There are lot's of similar things that you only notice once you face your past, process it and heal step by step. There really is a lot that's not your fault and you will only understand once you become more aware and as you change.

Life is really hard. Don't make it harder for yourself. Be kind to yourself, things happen, you can only face your past and actively choose your future step by step.

What a lot of people who make art, myself included, experience is that we judge ourselves really hard, our skills suck, the art we create sucks, but if anyone else shows us their art we also see all the good things, the potential and we would never think of them as failures. But we do think so of ourselves, just because we are hard on ourselves. We somehow try to make up for all the things we lack by being more strict, by increasing our expectations for ourselves, but that only keeps us from ever being happy. The expectations rise with our skill level, change with our situation, so we will always feel frustrated, trying to become perfect and it doesn't exist. Perfect is a decision. 

You are good enough the way you are. You are perfect! You are human. You can only do so much, because your resources are limited, you only have a certain amount of time, energy and focus or willpower. Feeling anxious and depressed takes a lot of those.   
I know you feel broken, but you are just out of balance and you tried to make up for that, somehow just surviving most of the time, not really living. But it was all you could do. And you did well! You are here!"," Yeah I understand. The reason people are so supportive is that life is hard and many have similar experiences. 

It took me a very long time to understand that I need to be more kind to myself, because I really didn't know better, couldn't change it. The thing is that there are many thing you need to know when you want to change and no one is teaching you those things. No one. The internet makes it easier to connect and talking about our struggles sometimes helps to find out about the things we need to change or that we can do. 

I make art and depression was always holding me back from creating but in the last few years when i was mostly free of depression, i also noticed it affected my perspective and my ability to understand certain things. If I simplify this, depression kept me stuck and dumb. There are lot's of similar things that you only notice once you face your past, process it and heal step by step. There really is a lot that's not your fault and you will only understand once you become more aware and as you change.

27956,m89zwgd,comment,,"Oh and also, I really REALLY recommend getting into a morning routine. My life changed and I pulled myself off antidepressants just by this really mundane concept. I’ll give you mine, the one that changed my life, as an example: 

Every day, I woke up at 7:30AM and I would make myself a freshly squeezed celery juice. The juicer and the juice idea was given to me by a very close friend of mine who is a well known chef here in NYC. Anyways, the juice was the first thing I would consume, even before a glass of water. Why? Because, and I apologize for not being too subtle but there ain’t nothing that isn’t a colonic, that is going to flush your system within 10 minutes of drinking it. Coffee could never… why is this important? You are removing the waste and toxins from the day before. You actually feel better and more comfortable when you 💩 first thing in the AM. 

Anyways, after I would go through that relatively quick and very reliably consistent process, I would drink a glass of water with lemon and then take my husky for a mile walk through Central Parks north woods. I would return home right after and then I would go back out again and go for a 1 mile run; sometimes a light jog, didn’t matter as long as I was outside and active. After, I would make myself breakfast, which was always a steel oats oatmeal with fresh blueberries, flax seed and honey. Sometimes I would brew a cup of coffee for myself and from that point I would shower and get ready for the day. 

It was through this process I learned the power of routine as it showed that when you start your day off with menial accomplishments, no matter how small or trivial they may seem, your mind feels a sense of achievement regardless and so you’re starting your day off with a better mindset and outlook. How does this help? Well, it’s simple; you make better choices and your critical thinking and conflict resolution are drastically improved and more aligned with your objectives. You feel like you’ve already conquered the world. They say it’s hard to get into a routine and I won’t lie there was roughly a month for me before I was consistently doing this routine Monday through Sunday.

Stop doing things to make others feel special and happy that will make them know you are always there for them no matter what. Those who make you feel shi**y or have made you feel shitty or not seen... they don't deserve you. You should never have to feel the way you do.

We may have never met you but you are a brother to us all, you are a child of the lord. And it will break all of our hearts. Not one of us want anything from you like those in your life might want.

My family is the only thing that is keeping me going. I got no friends either. I would suggest you to start talking to your parent and siblings , it will make you feel much better . 
Focus on career and make shit load of money and travel the world. (That's my plan and it might work for you too :p)

There are also alot of support groups you can join where we get to talk to alot of people.(I sometimes used talklife app if I am really really down) 

You aren't alone and you will find plenty of people to talk to! 
All the best , and donot think of taking any drastic steps. God has given us this life and we should cherish every minute of it.

We take it day by day, but she is still trying and I tell her she deserves happiness and love as much as anyone. So do you. Don’t give up. 

I saw you said you tried therapy in a comment. Please give it another try. Many times you don’t get the right person at first. Others may have better resources for you to try but here’s a link to a site that can help you find someone: https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists

You can try virtual appointments if that is more comfortable. 

I know it’s hard to share with strangers, especially when you’ve had to be so strong your whole life and keep all this bottled up inside. But a better life is possible. Life is beautiful and it’s waiting on you to join it. 

Thank God for your pets. Hopefully, one day you’ll find self fulfillment and later people who make you want to live even more than they do.

We lasted less then a month bc I didn't want him to get to attached. and i stopped talking to all of them. But the underage one kept messaging me very few months and we just joked and then I would push him away. Well that was until a few months ago. We started talking more and more but as friends but i caught feelings, and I would pick up on a few things he did every once and awhile that made me think he may of liked me as well. To add I was still doing the same persona that I did years ago. He's now 19 and I'm 17 almost 18 so he's a year a like 9 months older. Well today I messed with him and again one thing led to another I confessed my feelings for him and soon enough he agreed that he felt the same and had for years.
I'm still in shock over this bc I thought he didn't and I really like this guy like a lot a lot. 
Now this is where I need advice, I need to break this to him but how?!? I know he's going to get mad at me but how do I go about telling him? 
How do you tell someone you are not the rich independent women I made myself out as?? 
I am independent and make decent money rn but I'm still loving with my parents and I'm not 22 (which would be the persona's age rn) 
I completely know this is my fault so please do not give hatred towards me as I don't gain any help from it. 
I should mention that this would be long distance, I've never met any of them but the 19 year old lives near my state but that's not a problem for me. 
Any help at all is appreciated.","Lied about my age and I have a separate persona from my real life.

I didn’t struggle with mental health issues until my thyroid started having problems and it made me realize my brothers issues could have very much been medical. 

I think looking at this from a “what is the root cause?” Will help you pull through. Could it be medical? Hormone imbalances causing depression? If it’s from childhood trauma, could your nervous system be dysregulated?  

This will help you stop blaming yourself and being hard on yourself. Instead it’s a problem to solve, a mystery to crack. 

You truly sound clinically depressed. There’s medication that can help. At least for the short term, pull you out of the funk you are in. Then you can start putting one foot infront of the other. My aunt struggled with clinical depression and said without medication she’d just lay on the couch and do nothing.

28002,1i690si,post,I Am Cursed To A Life Of Misery And The Curse Rubs Off On All Those Close To Me,"Don't believe me?

I was born early due to a silent placental abruptly nearly killing my mother and myself. My first tears were of blood. I wasn't supposed to survive, and because I did I think that is why I am cursed. 

My father became permanently disabled due to a car accident a couple of years after my birth. This caused him to be the Stay At Home Parent and my mother to work 1 to 2 jobs to keep us above water. He didn't have to be permanently disabled he just gave up. He had a failed spinal fusion that caused pain, but he ciuld have fought. But I believe his PTSD from being a war veteran made it impossible, plus my ""curse"". He neglected me my entire childhood, instead playing video games for 10 to 12 hours a day. I wasn't enough to even has his attention. We moved into my grandfather's house as well because my dad's disability check and my mom's work check wasn't enough. My mother wanted to be a SAHM so badly but couldn't, and instead now had to work 8 to 9 hours a day 5 to 6 days a week, and do all the cooking and cleaning because of my father's laziness. This left her no time to spend with me. I would sob when she would leave for work, I couldn't take it. My grandfather did not like children and made this well known, also ignoring me or outright verbally tearing me down.

Him not paying attention helped lead to the circumstanced of my CSA. My older sibling by 5 years had been exposed to pornography young and they wanted to experiment. Because we were alone all of the time while he was supposed to watch us, I was the easy target. From 3 to 10 I was abused constantly, nearly every day, and it got worse with age. 

My sibling grew to hate me, as I was the ""golden"" child. I striped for perfection, hoping if I was perfect enough it'd make my family love me. Care about me. Pay attention. My sibling's way of getting the attention we so desperately needed was to have extreme outbursts. Screaming matches between them and my father were constant. Id hide in my closet and hold my hands over my ears and oray to make it stop. In private experimentation turned to torture because they wanted to hurt me. 

I developed at first a binge eating disorder at around 8 that turned to anorexia/bulimia at around 12.

I grew insanely depressed in a love deprived household, and began talking to strangers online. I sent pictures and videos and so many times I almost met up with adults who promised to take me away. 

At school I was bullied horrendously, and each year it got worse and worse. In middle school I realized I was queer and I cut off my hair and started dressing masculine, how I always wished to. The bullying was so bad. It was like they all knew something was wrong with me. Any friends I did have I would later find out were keeping me around to make fun of me. 

I started Self Harm at 13 and it grew into an addiction

I fell in love at late 13 early 14, she was the most amazing person I had ever met. I finally felt happy, despite the struggles I had in private. She Understood me. She killed herself 2 months after I had first tried to kill myself. I fully believe I was supposed to die, not her. I cursed her. It was my fault. 

At 15 got a headache that never went away. At 16 I needed emergency brain surgery and every doctor blamed me when I didn't get better and would call me names and tell me I was faking. Later found out I have multiple rare disorders. It's been 10 years and I have been in pain every day since.

Im losing functioning of my body. I can't work.  There is no cure. No treatment. No hope. I keep needing surgery after surgery after surgery, on dozens of medications, and I spend almost every day doing NOTHING.

I can't keep friends, they always end up telling me I'm a horrible person or they've been lying and telling me whatever I want to hear this whole time or pretending to be my friend out of obligation. 

I've been SAd and harassed and abused as an adult by many. 

I am in love and engaged to the most wonderful human but I feel I've cursed him. He lost his mother to cancer, watching her deteriorate. Now the person he is in love with is deteriorating and he has to watch with no ability to help. I've trapped him. 

My parents and grandfather are still miserable, living every day exactly the same. My mother is forced to work somewhere she hates, a place that kills her inside, all for my insurance. It's my fault.

I am cursed to a life of misery. And all of those around me will suffer

It is difficult to treat because doing what's necessary can feel like it won't work or it's not worth the effort anyway.

As others have mentioned, taking very tiny steps toward responsibility does help. It rebuilds the part of your brain that seeks out challenges and makes you feel like you ""can"" do it. It will be hard and scary, but it will get better.

Whatever the reasons, whatever is in your past or whatever isn't in your future, it doesn't matter.

I'm also not against using AI as a tool. It's fantastic, but also allows you to skip important steps for critical thinking and problem solving, which at a kid level, should not be the first thing to use.

28044,1i6a3zm,post,I (44m) had a one night stand with a former top 15 Miss America (late 30’s).,"I made a last minute decision to go to a concert. Found a ticket, booked a hotel room across the street from the venue. Rolled a few J’s, hopped in the car and drove 4 hours to the show.

Since it was a spontaneous trip; and in the middle of the week, I was solo. Went to the show and had an amazing time. Whiskey drinks were flowing and I was feeling good. After the show I got back to my room, grabbed my J’s and headed out to my car for a night cap.

Leaving my room and headed to the car I ran into a lady leaving the elevator. Like literally almost ran into her. I apologized, and noticed she was dressed like she was at the same show; she had been. I told her I was headed out for a night cap and she asked to join me. She dropped her stuff off in her room, which was right next to mine and we were off down to my car.

We hit it off instantly! Convo was easy and very enjoyable. And as a bonus she was absolutely stunning. So much so when we were talking I was getting lost just looking at her face. Talked about our careers, family travel etc. 1 J turned into 3 and after and hour and a half we decided to call it. Headed back up to our floor and decided to exchange numbers to keep in touch.

We went separate ways but heading to my door I turned back to get one last look at her and caught her doing the same thing. We locked eyes and smiled. She asked if she could get a hug goodbye. Of course I obliged, and that hug turned into another. Then she invited me in. She was so pretty; I jokingly asked her how much this was going to cost me. She said nothing, grabbed my hand lead me into her room. We both had a night of a lifetime.

I looked her up when I got back home (to make sure I didn’t have sex with a serial killer or something) and she was a former Miss America top 15 and owns a multi million dollar business. She never mentioned either of those things to me.

We’ve been texting almost everyday since. I’ve been married for 27 years and can’t believe I’m in this situation. I simply could not resist.

     I'm a 44 year old man but when I was 36 I did something very foolish and it cost me everything or at least that's what I thought at the moment. I actually thought my life was over, but somehow it didn't work out that way and I really made the best of a terrible situation.I was sentenced to 5 years in state prison for something petty and stupid, before I went to prison I didn't have a job, not a dollar to my name and no prospects, no girlfriend or wife or even two decent friends, my future did not look good.
     The first day in prison I was setting in my cell this tiny 5ft by 10ft cube feeling like shit, still withdrawing from all prescription drugs I was abusing on the outside, I was done with everything.This lead me to do something I had never done before and to be honest I really didn't know how to do this thing I was about to try, but I muddled through as I knelt down and started to pray. Personally I had never been very religious, I've always been a Christian but up into that point to me God was just someone that turned his back on this world. But I didn't know what else to do and as I was praying the most amazing thing happened, and no not a miracle, a thought popped into my hand, saying that I was a lot stronger then I ever gave myself credit for, then another voice said to me that I didn't need some almighty power to save me and that I was strong enough to do that myself.So I got up off my knees got into every job and activity I could in prison I even became a tutor while I was locked up i  helped guys get there GED and then at 18 months from my release I was offered work release, left prison with almost $30,000 in my account.Six weeks after I got out I met the girl of my dreams, Rebecca, we had almost 6 wonderful years together a lot more then I ever deserved then she got sick and passed away. 
  So I say this to you ma'am you start with one little step, wethers it's something as simple as deciding the night before that your gonna set your alarm for certain time and when the alarm goes off your gonna wake up and get out of your bed and then your gonna make your bed.Back when I had to literally start my entire life over I realized you cant do something that by trying to tackle huge shit all at once because if you do your just setting yourself up for failure.Like you, at least I'm assuming from what I've read from you, I had to rebuild confidence in myself and the only I could figure out how to do that was doing tiny little small tasks at first and to not overwhelm myself and then before I realized I was doing those tiny little tasks daily without even thinking about it. Start by simply making your bed in the morning girl.
      It's the little things in life that make the difference. Start doing 1 new tiny task every two days, these tasks should make you feel good about yourself, should make you feel like your just starting your new adult life. Then hopefully one day not to far off in the future you'll wake up, make that bed bet a shower eat and go to work feeling good about yourself.

He was next to me on exam and i called him 2 or more times to ask answer but he didn't even turned around and after that when we were out of class i acciedently hit him on stomach with my elbow(it was embrassing). but i didnt take the intiation to talk to him. i used look for him in the crowd and my eyes were fixed into him through those 2 years. we used to take same bus and sometimes he went brushing off my hand with his and i used to float into clouds thinking about it all day. somtimes i felt like he was also glancing at me but maybe i was all over him so i thought so. but i didnt tell any of my friend i had crush on him idk what stopped me from telling them but i didnt had any courage and my friendship was on edge( i dont talk to her much these days). But at the end of the year i told my frn but i couldnt bring myself to confess to him. I should have went to the tour arranged by school so i could talk to him but my parents didnt allow me to which i regret very much, Not going to tour in high school is one of the regret i have in my life.

But he keeps appearing my mind and im not even connected with him any socials. I should have gathered up much courage and socalized with more ppls but my fucking introverted side didnt let me do it and now im just here thinking how i just let go a good oppurtunity.

I live in a different country and have done for 7 years. It’s hard being a lone at times all my close friends I had here have left. So I don’t really have “connected friends” anymore. Just people. 

One thing I’ve learnt when being in this position and I’ve been in this position many times is to just focus on yourself and yourself only I’m 31 this year and on my 30th birthday no one messaged me nor did I get any gifts or anything. 

Your life has meaning, focus on yourself everyone else is secondary. There is a quid pro quo for everything. People come people go.

I’ve spent 2024 calling my father only for him to never answer cause he’s busy with work (which is fair enough) but not all the time so now I’ve taken a step back and stoped messaging my fathers side of the family cause they never tried. 

But out of all the possibilities we as humans are allowed to feel, we’re lucky to have these feelings shit or not. 

In my depression I’ve learnt to rationalize and question my negative thoughts as “why” and what’s the solution. Took a while but it helps remove the pressure from your brain still depressed but it removes the whole “I want to kill myself” which I’ve planned many of times. 

It’s okay to feel sad and it’s okay to feel these things! Hope you enjoy cold play man

28141,m8b1p16,comment,,">This is definitely some kind of miracle or a sign

That’s the best part: it’s really not lol. This is just normal people being empathetic, it’s not miraculous at all, because most people have always cared at least this much if not more. We just don’t always know who needs to hear it until they speak up is all.

We’re lucky to live in an era where anyone can reach hundreds of thousands of people in an instant if they really feel like it (it has other downsides, but in this case it is useful). People don’t really have to be lonely if they don’t want to be, as long as they are willing to be brave and ask for someone to talk to. I’m glad you said something.

I think you should start a discord and drop an invite to it on this post. If anyone here really does want to be your friend I say let them. You’ve got an interesting opportunity to create an entire grass roots online community literally overnight lol.

This is really random, but this year, I'm doing something called Camp Wildfire (they might have something similar in America). I'm basically going solo to an adult only summer camp with thousands of random people who are also going solo because we have no friends IRL, so the idea is to throw 10,000 lonely adults together for a weekend of debauchery.

By the way, I hate Coldplay, but I'd put up with them for you."," This sucks! I'm in a similar situation to you, so I feel your pain. I'm so pleased to see all these positive reactions to your post.

28196,m8b8w34,comment,,"Take a nice BIG dose of vitamin C and it will help the stimulants flush out of your system quicker. About 1000% of the RDA (so one of those emergen-c packets or similar will do the trick)
If you were prescribed 45mg/day and took 5 10mg doses  you're gonna be fine your body just isn't used to the dose right now. As a much older (35) ADHDer I can tell you that it does get better as you learn more about ADHD and develop better coping mechanisms. I highly recommend finding some good ADHD podcasts and following creators like Catieosaurus who create educational content for ND folks navigating adulthood. 
Find other ND folks, the weirdos are there for each other like no one else. You're amazing exactly how you are, give yourself permission to let the freak flag fly - it's a beacon for other ND folks and likely how you will find your people."," Take a nice BIG dose of vitamin C and it will help the stimulants flush out of your system quicker.

23211,luam2jq,comment,,"I can sense the depth of your pain and the complex layers of your experience. Feeling this way, especially when you’re carrying so much on your shoulders, is incredibly challenging. It's okay to feel confused and overwhelmed—many people in similar situations experience these feelings as they try to make sense of their inner struggles.


You're carrying the weight of unprocessed trauma from your past, which can deeply affect how you feel about the present and the future. The sadness and emptiness you’re describing might be linked to the unresolved pain of those past events and the natural mourning of what could have been—be it a childhood, a sense of safety, or a less complicated beginning to motherhood.


It's promising that you're on antidepressants and that some effects, like a reduction in anger, are showing. But medication often works best when combined with therapy. In a therapeutic setting, we can work through those tangled feelings—exploring that emptiness, understanding where it stems from, and, most importantly, finding ways to fill it with something nurturing and healing. Therapy can also help in building a future that feels safer, more stable, and less haunted by past trauma.


Consider speaking with a therapist about trauma-informed approaches, such as EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) or Cognitive Processing Therapy, both of which have shown positive outcomes for people dealing with deep-rooted trauma. Engaging in mindfulness practices or journaling could also help by grounding you in the present, gradually reducing the lingering sadness and bringing more light into your day-to-day life.


The emptiness may feel unbearable right now, but you don’t have to face it alone. Seeking support and giving yourself grace through this journey might slowly open a path toward a life where you can experience joy, love, and fulfillment without the shadow of the past always creeping in. Remember, reaching out for help is a powerful act of strength, not weakness."," I can sense the depth of your pain and the complex layers of your experience.

23220,luamgcx,comment,,"Thank you for trusting me with your story. Let’s take this step by step. First, I want to acknowledge how incredibly resilient you are. You’ve been through so much, yet here you are, seeking answers, willing to face the pain rather than run from it. That takes a special kind of courage.


You mentioned feeling an emptiness that’s difficult to explain, a void that seems to linger even when some anger has softened. I wonder if that void is trying to tell us something. Often, these feelings stem from unresolved parts of our lives—places where our needs weren’t met, or where trauma left its mark. That emptiness may be connected to parts of you that weren’t able to feel safe or understood when they needed to be.


Let’s think of this void as a signal, a message from within. It could be your inner self asking for the nurturing and comfort it may have missed out on. Together, we can gently explore this space, peeling back the layers in a way that feels safe. We’re not rushing anything here. Healing takes time, and you deserve to feel supported through every part of it.


Would it be okay if we explored some tools to help you stay connected and grounded? Practices like mindfulness, breathing exercises, and even journaling can be powerful ways to listen to yourself without feeling overwhelmed. You’ve already taken an incredible first step by reaching out, and in therapy, we’ll create a space where that sadness can be expressed, understood, and slowly transformed.


If it feels right, we can also look at ways to build a sense of safety and belonging within yourself. I want you to know that it’s possible to fill that void with things that bring you joy, stability, and love. In time, we’ll work on ways to create a life that isn’t overshadowed by the past but instead illuminated by the strength and resilience you’re discovering within yourself.


How does all of this sit with you? Are there any thoughts or feelings coming up as we talk?"," Thank you for trusting me with your story. Let’s take this step by step. First, I want to acknowledge how incredibly resilient you are. You’ve been through so much, yet here you are, seeking answers, willing to face the pain rather than run from it. That takes a special kind of courage.


You mentioned feeling an emptiness that’s difficult to explain, a void that seems to linger even when some anger has softened. I wonder if that void is trying to tell us something. Often, these feelings stem from unresolved parts of our lives—places where our needs weren’t met, or where trauma left its mark. That emptiness may be connected to parts of you that weren’t able to feel safe or understood when they needed to be.


Let’s think of this void as a signal, a message from within. It could be your inner self asking for the nurturing and comfort it may have missed out on. Together, we can gently explore this space, peeling back the layers in a way that feels safe. We’re not rushing anything here. Healing takes time, and you deserve to feel supported through every part of it.


Would it be okay if we explored some tools to help you stay connected and grounded? Practices like mindfulness, breathing exercises, and even journaling can be powerful ways to listen to yourself without feeling overwhelmed. You’ve already taken an incredible first step by reaching out, and in therapy, we’ll create a space where that sadness can be expressed, understood, and slowly transformed.


If it feels right, we can also look at ways to build a sense of safety and belonging within yourself. I want you to know that it’s possible to fill that void with things that bring you joy, stability, and love. In time, we’ll work on ways to create a life that isn’t overshadowed by the past but instead illuminated by the strength and resilience you’re discovering within yourself.

Third, if he has access to children/ grand children today he is probably still abusing them, or neighbors kids. They cannot turn off their attraction to kids. What kind of work does he do, is it a job with access to kids? If so you can do something about it. 
Fourth, some states have no statute of limitations on child sexual abuse, ask around your local law enforcement to see what yours is if you still live where it happened. What you want to know though, what is the law in the state he lived in when he was sexually assaulting you. If you want to, you may be able to bring up charges on him now.

If he has a new family with kids around you can warn the parents of the kids not to ever leave their children alone with him.

I just don’t think you understand that it’s wrong until you’re older",3,,2024-09-01 16:20:12,t3_1f4b3gs,,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1f4b3gs/i_was_sad_when_i_was_younger_i_lied_to_cps_to/ll0bthk/,Neutral

Whatever her issues are, she's the broken one. Let her carry the guilt and shame of her actions - or lack of.

Forgive yourself for whatever it is you feel, please. None of it is on you. You remained silent to stay safe with your mom. You did the best you could with what you had, and that's all you could do. ❤️


I didn't say it in my earlier comment, but for me, when it was family, I lied. I was 5, and my mom was grilling me in front of my brother and my dad, and she scared me.

When I was 8 or 9, it was the son of my mom's friend and the daughter of my dad's friend. Both were several years older than me. I wondered (probably obsessed about) what I did to make all of these people want to touch me, and I started getting sick and throwing up. I eventually told my mom, and she lost it, but not over what happened to me - over what happened to her as a child. She started bawling and being weird, and I felt like I had to comfort her. She told EVERYBODY in the boy's family, and my dad, and promptly took me to therapy... Where I lied because I was uncomfortable. She also continued to leave me alone with that family.

It took me a long time to realize that all of this was her fuck up, not mine. I couldn't say anything to her because she still wasn't safe, so I wrote it all down just to get it out. It was hard because writing it was going through it again, but getting it out is a bit like taking the lid off of a boiling pot of water, it releases the pressure. Every time you lift the lid, there's less pressure, and less pain. After I wrote it, I ripped it into pieces and pitched it, or burned it (safely). 

All of that is so anyone reading this knows, I really do get it. I also know that none of us had any control over what happened or how the adults around us did or did not react.

And, as someone else said - pedophiles know what they're doing. They know what to say and do to make a child feel special, loved, wanted, etc. They are attracted to children just like we are attracted to adults of whatever gender.

If anyone is reading this who carries guilt for something that happened TO you, please find a way to let it out. It's not your fault. I don't care if you stripped naked, ran around with bells on, made unicorn farts and jumped on your abuser - that idea was planted, and it's NOT YOUR FAULT."," I'm so sorry your mom did that to you.

I hope you can bring yourself to tell your counselor. She's the person who needs to know more than anyone else in the world. ",268,,2024-04-05 19:47:35,t3_1bwqkzh,,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1bwqkzh/i_remembered_i_abused_my_pets_as_a_kid_and_i_cant/ky7x4y7/,Neutral

2. Yes, what you did was wrong, but I would agree somewhat with one of the other commenters: If your cat had felt assaulted, it would have clawed its way out and you wouldn't have been able to catch him again. Cats like humans, yes, but they do not show subservience and will not let themselves be abused like a dog would out of love.


3. I have had a few dogs rub themselves on my legs happily without my consent and trying to come back once pushed away, and well... that's what animals do. You did not hurt them physically.


Is the cat still alive somewhere? If yes, you should go and see it. Apologize to it and also see the cat's reaction to you, which I would bet would make you feel better (I'm not saying the cat will be deliriously happy to see you. It's a cat, and if you haven't seen it in a long time it might sulk and ignore you on purpose. But I'd bet you won't see fear).

EDIT: Just to add. If you were SAed as a child, it would have definitely blurred the barriers of what is acceptable or not for you then.

I don’t really know what to say first. When I posted this I was expecting nothing but hateful comments and had made relative peace with that (and there have been some),  but the amount of support I’ve received is overwhelming. 

I was able to talk to a new counselor today. I told him everything, and you guys were right. He wasn’t shocked at all. In fact, basically confirmed that I had experienced CSA and that this is a relatively common development from it. I cried long and hard hearing that. He suggested I look for forgiveness in myself and god, and I haven’t been religious for some time, but I might take his advice. I still feel awful and like I’m hiding it from those I love, but he said whether I share it with others or not is my decision and is not required, that I can forgive myself and work out my shame without telling people. I’m also looking into volunteer work and might still seek out confession through a church. 

Thank you to everyone that responded with understanding, feedback, and their own stories. I’m far from accepting myself, but I think this has helped."," For some reason I can’t edit the original post but I wanted to give an update.

23291,ky8zdu7,comment,,"Hi, I did the same thing. And I actually came here to tell someone, and then I saw your post. 

I used my cats for sexual gratification. The first time I was 10 or 11 yo. I know, just a kid at that time. But it happened a couple of more times. At 13, 14, 17, maybe 18. I know it's fucked up, and at that time I really should have known better. But it didn't even cross my mind. Never thought about how my actions could have consequences, how it could harm my cat or my perception of sexuality. It was never a regular thing or a habit, but one time would have already been one too many. 

Roughly two years ago the repressed memories of this surfaced and I was convinced that I didn't deserve to be alive. That I am so screwed in the head, that I did something so wrong, nothing I will ever do will be good or enough because I'm an inherently bad person. That I could never tell anyone about this even though I suffer so much, because everybody would leave and they wouldn't be wrong to do so.
I managed to survive and after a couple of days the memories and flashbacks went away.

Until half a year later. The memories rushed back and it was even worse than before, because in the meantime me and my boyfriend broke up, so I felt like the loneliest person in the world. I decided to tell a friend, that there is something that's weighing heavily on me. That I feel guilty and ashamed and that it is about something I did. I told her how old I was, how often it happened, but not what it was. I couldn't bring myself to tell her. But it helped. Of course she said, that I'm a great and kind person. That she loves me whatever it is I did, but I couldn't quite believe her. It helped, though. The feelings of shame and guilt and embarrassment were still there, but I didn't want to kms anymore.

I guess you probably realized by now: those feelings, these memories and flashbacks and thoughts came in waves. They were never gone, always in the back of my mind, but every couple of months they would come crashing down on me. (They still do, kind of why I'm here). 

I eventually did tell my friend what I did. A year ago.
And she loved me still. She said that people do all kinds of shit when their brains aren't yet developed. Also sexual shit. 

I haven't talked to her about it since then, even though I still struggle with shame a lot. The thought of me being a bad person and undeserving of love. 
I don't want to remind her of it, in case she forgot. And in my head, once I remind her, she abandons me. 

My cat actually lived with my grandparents at that point, and still does. I went there to apologize to him. He never seemed to be afraid of me, so that was a relief at least. 

I'm sure your cat found a great family to live in.


I would really like to talk to a therapist about this, but I'm on a waiting list, and it will take some time until I'll be able to do so. But I'm trying to cope. And it has already gotten easier.

So, if you have a counselor, talk to them about it. I promise, it helps. And I promise that you are not a bad person, because you did bad things. 
Here's what I learned: this feeling of guilt means that you outgrew the person you once were. 
The fact that you would rather kill yourself than be a person who does this, means, that you are NOT this person anymore. No amount of guilt can change the past and the world isn't a better place if you think that you're a bad person.

you haven't disappointed anyone but yourself. we are the stars of our own lives, no one really thinks of us as much as we do. and you didn't eff up by getting SA'd. you didn't deserve it, no one does. you were assaulted against your consent. breaking an animals consent as a child, when your brain isn't fully developed, has nothing to do with your consent and body being violated years later. karma, fate, destiny don't exist. they're just myths and legends that we use to help us or torture ourselves.

when i was dealing with my SA, and was in therapy, i went to a Catholic church and asked them if i could do confession too even if i wasn't religious. and they said anyone could, you don't have to be religious or a member. confession is good for healing, they said. so i went to confession, and i think it helped. i felt unburdened each time. if you want to confess to a religious figure, you don't have to be religious or a member of their religion/church/synagogue/mosque. they welcome anyone and are willing to listen and keep confidence. i also went to a Methodist Church for food bank and free clothing. the support they offered, though i'm Atheist, just helped me heal so much. in this modern age of shrinkflation/housing crisis where else are ya gonna get free in person support from really nice people, i guess.

i hope you can find some nice people to unburden yourself to. you were a hormonal, lonely kid with an under-developed brain and shitty parenting. the combo is incredibly common. what isn't common is someone actually feeling guilty and wanting to confess/make amends. i think you're better than most who eff up as kids b/c you feel guilty. and you're definitely better than your adult assaulter. eff them btw. just eff em."," our brains don't fully develop, especially our frontal brains (the source for mature logic and decision making), until we're 25 years old. if you were a kid, your frontal brain wasn't developed enough to make this a crime. basically, yes the cat couldn't consent but legally neither could you. that's why sex consent laws exist b/c our brains don't develop fully until we're 25 yrs old. if you were 16 or under you definitely weren't able to consent either.

23296,kya4vsf,comment,,"Sweetie, you're being way too hard on yourself. Tell your therapist and see how not shocked he is. People do awful things, and they do them as fully conscious adults who know better. People who abuse animals don't do it because they don't know better--they do it because they enjoy violating and hurting the animal, the same way rapists don't rape for sexual gratification but for power. *That's not you.* You were a kid who probably had messed up sexual ideas and boundaries due to events entirely out of your control. You yourself said you didn't know it was wrong! 

Oh, and from one SA survivor to another: no you didn't deserve it! Don't tell yourself that!

You said you've been dealing with some possible recovered memories of CSA. (Hey, me, too! We're a lot alike.) Ignore this if it doesn't ring true, but I wonder if the guilt you're feeling is actually self-blame from the CSA (which also isn't deserved). You said the flashbacks about the cat started around the same time, right? Is it possible that you felt shame about what happened to you as a child, but the memories are coming back out of order, and you've attributed the memories of shame to an incident that's easier (relative term, I know) to handle? I suggest this because, frankly, your guilt over this thing with the cat is disproportionate. You simply don't deserve to hate yourself. Like I said, if that doesn't feel like an explanation, chuck it out the window. But give it a few seconds if thought first.

The effects of CSA are so layered and complicated. Give yourself some grace. If you really feel you need forgiveness, here it is: I forgive you. Your penance is to forgive yourself.

Hit me up anytime."," Sweetie, you're being way too hard on yourself. Tell your therapist and see how not shocked he is. People do awful things, and they do them as fully conscious adults who know better. People who abuse animals don't do it because they don't know better--they do it because they enjoy violating and hurting the animal, the same way rapists don't rape for sexual gratification but for power. *That's not you.* You were a kid who probably had messed up sexual ideas and boundaries due to events entirely out of your control. You yourself said you didn't know it was wrong! 

Oh, and from one SA survivor to another: no you didn't deserve it! Don't tell yourself that!

You said you've been dealing with some possible recovered memories of CSA. (Hey, me, too! We're a lot alike.) Ignore this if it doesn't ring true, but I wonder if the guilt you're feeling is actually self-blame from the CSA (which also isn't deserved). You said the flashbacks about the cat started around the same time, right?

Female here and very similar thing happened to me when I was 10/11ish years old, with my grandmas dog. Dog was way too invested in peoples crotches and me as a kid thought wtf he's looking for in my pants, and yeah. 
That was sadly my first sexual experience ever and I am by no means in the world a zoophile or bestiality approver.
 But as a pubescent child it was just an unfortunate stupid way to discover that I can feel sexual things, and cause they felt good I did it some more times til I got older and realized how fucking disgusting this is.
I also surpressed this memory til it's started creeping up on me recently, the guilt was eating me alive, I had problems recieving oral sex from partners cause thoughts of what happend to me intruded my headspace and making me feel disgusted and ashamed of myself. 
I posted multiple times on r/offmychest but deleted cause I was afraid of being judged and no one saw it  or replied to it so I got very scared. 
Thank you for sharing your story and also make others like me feel heard, it's not your fault for discovering your sexuality through other beings than human, I think that's ok among all living beings as long as no one is seriously harmed. The worst part about it is, like I noticed myself, is that we want to be punished for it, that we feel like we need to be judged for it.
What we did is not a crime, we were kids, we didn't know better, no one was harmed. I want to learn to forgive myself for it, and I think I will tell my partner, which would be the very first human I will tell, about it irl.
I don't want to hide that this happened and that it shaped me in some way or form in my earliest sexual years. All this blaming myself made me afraid to speak up about what I sexually want and need and I got taken advantage of a lot. Please don't think the SA is a sort of karma, you are not at fault.

On one hand, it was once-off and I know for a fact I was SA'd beforehand. On the other hand, I was older (probably 16, possibly 17) and I \*definitely\* knew better -- I distinctly remember consciously thinking it was wrong when I did it.

- Echoing the sentiment that you didn't deserve SA; it was not karma, and I wish that didn't happen to you. A world where we believe SA is never deserved would have less rape than a world where we believe perpetrators deserve SA, if only because it gives ammo for people to frame innocents as guilty to justify SAing them.

- I disagree with people saying that it's not normal to feel this guilty, and that it's a sign of mental illness. Clearly there are others in this thread who hate you just as much -- the disproportional guilt is a perfectly rational response in the society we live in and it's not crazy to hate yourself just as much as you \*know\* others will hate you. You also get compassionate people, of course, but the haters are real and they have a real impact on us.

- I disagree with the commenters in this thread saying the animals probably weren't harmed. It reminds me of the logic I used to excuse my own actions (my victim's lifespan is probably around 5 years so it's '''not that bad''') Animals and children are more conscious and agential than we give them credit for. Where other people are suggesting you volunteer to help animals or adopt another pet and treat them better, I would instead recommend looking into animal liberation. I myself am trying to go freegan, and avoid purchasing anything that contains animal products (I still dumpster dive meat and stuff though). A big part of why I abused was because to some degree, I saw animals as objects, to be used for food, entertainment etc. If you do decide to have another animal live with you, I'd recommend not thinking of them as ""your pet"", that is under your control, but a fellow sentient being whose autonomy you respect (including if they decide to leave).

I don't think we need to minimize our actions in order to forgive ourselves -- in fact, doing so cheapens the forgiveness. Something that helped me a lot was consequentialism; I don't believe in ""deserving"". The only reason (a bad person feeling good) is bad is because it makes them at greater risk of continuting to be bad to others and hurting them without anything to deter that harmful behaviour. Not because they don't ""deserve"" to feel good.

That added to the fact of my lack of sociability made my whole adolescence a world enclosed in the internet and my family of which i do not complain.


the internet is difficult, i saw people who normalized weird things, ""because if others do it then it's not bad"" i guess i thought, by that time my dog was always in heat, for a territorial issue more than anything.


and i would sometimes push her away from me, i think i was about sixteen ( i was the typical girl who cuts herself, horrible though ) whatever, i started to get satisfaction from it and let her ride my leg. Remembering it currently sucks, it got to a point where i would get on all fours and let her keep riding my leg, currently i remember this and realize how sickening it is. Plus there was a family member's dog that used to sniff me and it also turned me on somehow.


one day i stopped doing it, because i looked for videos about it, i admit. And i found a video of a guy fucking his dog that made me repulsed and i just threw up, stopped doing it and repressed the memories until now that i'm a grown woman.


many years have passed, i see my dog as normal, i like animals but i feel that i am tainted, i feel that i do not even deserve God's forgiveness ( ironically in my case i am a believer ), i also felt that i was lying to everyone, that i did not deserve to live but you know what?


all people make mistakes, no one person will tell you everything about themselves. You may even have a friend or family member who masturbates watching shady stuff and will never tell you, so you shouldn't feel obligated to tell your own family members.


i believe that even if you don't believe in God, seeking him will soothe your heart, and if you are not sexually attracted to animals then you are not a sick person. One mistake doesn't define the person you are^^

I wasn't SA'd that I know of, but did start watching incredibly graphic porn of adults with one another, and animals from around 10-11 which really confused me and definitely messed up they way I viewed sex, especially as it wasn't something that was spoken about in my family. The first time learning about it was from a friend and it became a bit of a joke if that made sense? For context, i didn't actually ever touch my dogs genital areas but slept with them naked and cuddled them, and said sexual things to them i'd seen in porn. The rational side to me realises this may have been me trying to recreate the porn i saw to make sense of it, as i remember feeling confused as to why people would engage in these acts. Whilst what I did was not inherently 'sexual' as there was no orgasm/ or touching of genitals, my intentions were sexual if that makes sense? 
I've kept this memory repressed for over a decade, and honestly forgot it happened, and recently it has resurfaced for me. I'm experiencing a lot of the same feelings you are right now, shame, guilt, disgust and suicidal thoughts. Its extremely difficult as i absolutely know that isn't who I am now, i've even been thinking more regularly about becoming vegetarian etc because of animal abuse. So i know i'm a person who has a grasp on morality now. I think what makes me feel sick though is the internalised thoughts of 'who am I? If i've done these terrible things, i can never be a good person' and thoughts that i'm keeping it from my long term partner and it may be a dealbreaker for them as they love animals. This post has made me have the courage to speak to my therapist about this as now I know i'm not alone in my mistakes, i want to heal and move on, and realise that perhaps i was a just a victim of disgusting content online, and that hurting people often hurt others."," I just want to say thankyou for writing this post, it takes alot of courage from you.

And then understand that it's done and behind you. Dieing over it is running away from the guilt not learning from it. 


You likely are a good kind person and not a liar. You've done a bad thing and see with clarity that it was bad. You are not going to do anything like it again because you know how it feels to carry that guilt. You are better now because of that. 


You don't deserve SA. That is utterly unrelated and horrible. Your trauma deserves its own space and it's own healing. Vengeance is not justice. 


Your relation to sex and consent is deeply damaged. Take responsibility for it and build up a right way of thinking with external frameworks. Wallowing in self hatred and saying you deserve the abuse is irresponsible and the easier path. Growing better, healthier, and with more compassion is harder. But it's the only relief


Personally, I suggest church. Everyone is a sinner, degree doesn't matter. Everyone falls short. Everyone can humble themselves and build a relationship with the Light and live for more than themself.

EDIT: Just saw your update, I'm really happy you were able to talk about it with your counselor and that you are working on a way to forgive yourself.

Allowing guilt and shame for something a child did, somewhat innocently i would even argue, shape you into being shameful and fearful and guilt ridden. I disagree with the ones who say guilt will keep you accountable. This guilt needs to turn to understanding and with that understanding you will no longer wish to do the things you did. Just like with many things we do as children and look back and think ""boy was I stupid then"". Just as we will turn old and look back today and think ""boy was I stupid then"". This is in no way any justification for what you did. But theres also no reason to condemn yourself over a childish act when you were a child. And please dont allow this to turn you away from being a man either. Which, I have good hopes for you because openly admitting this publicly and seeking assistance with processing what your experiencing right now is one thing men do. So dont take my words as an insult. They are not meant to be. In fact i think your doing well by talking about it.  

Just be careful.  Its a balancing game we all play here. Women tend to want men to take charge of things (but also be competent. Thats very important. A man who is responsible and competent who takes charge is one of the biggest turn ons for a woman. Whereas a man whos irresponsible and incompetent who tries to take charge is simply an aggressive and dangerous person. Real manliness comes not from the taking charge alone. Strive to be competent and responsible and patient and understanding, and then take charge. But do not try to take charge if you are continually messing stuff up. If this is you, find a man who is competent and responsible and follow him, learn from him. Try to only hang out with competent men and you will by the nature of things become more competent.) And men tend to want women to are somewhat more submissive in a way.

Its very hard to describe what im trying to say, as my ability to convey my meaning is not as good as it should be.

As for the SA thing, again I emphasize, it was a childish act by a child. Just know kids do that kind of thing sometimes and its an adult job to correct that behavior. Well, your either an adult or on your way to being one. So, correct that behavior by understanding its wrong and dont do it anymore. But dont remain guilt ridden over something like that because all it all it was just a touch and noone was actually hurt and she probably doesn't remember it.

Well, your either an adult or on your way to being one. So, correct that behavior by understanding its wrong and dont do it anymore. But dont remain guilt ridden over something like that because all it all it was just a touch and noone was actually hurt and she probably doesn't remember it. And if she hasnt said or acted like its bothered her. Why bring up a possibly traumatic experience for her if shes forgotten about it?",2,,2023-10-31 08:31:05,t3_17jfr3a,,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/17jfr3a/i_commited_sa_on_a_girl_and_cant_forgive_my_self/k77dg9u/,Neutral

But we don’t know this person just the confession. What I am saying is however, which I think I made clear, is that being a child isn’t an excuse as many in the comments are bending it to be. 

Would you forgive an adult who has grown from their mistakes after raping someone? Molesting someone? Killing someone (outside of self defense)? Bullying someone? 

Now reverse the ages and you’ll get my point. Being young isn’t an excuse when in society we see clearly right from wrong. Most kids learn hard lessons outside of their families like boundaries, personal space, not to bully, etc. So yes, they were young but that’s not a layer of protection imo. Feel free to disagree, it’s whatever.

Definitely. If we're talking strictly mentally, we are all vulnerable to different things. While there are majorities for many of these cases, we are not a collective. I do find it very important, however, that what does not effect me as much, I empathise towards people properly for who it most likely will. And I acknowledge that I am definitely an outlier and not the rule. So I do want to mention again especially for others reading, me not being traumatized is no incentive for anyone to go like ""Oh this one girl on the internet wasn't so the others are probably exaggerating with their 'issues' on sexual assault.""  
No, you piece of shit. That's not how this works. And I would be the first one to slam you down if I'd ever see you take advantage of a vulnerable person no matter what age or gender. (I've done martial arts since childhood so no empty words here)

If you were a minor, and ESPECIALLY if you were someone he coached, this may be something you do need to address, not just for the kids who are in danger now but for yourself as well. Speaking as both a victim of child SA by an adult and SA from peers and as an adult, so I'm overly qualified to talk about this, this guy everyone is yelling at and apparently sending death threats to, isn't entirely wrong to want to protect the children. As a mother, if I knew someone had information that could save my child from being SA'd like I was, I'd be livid and flabbergasted if someone chose to keep that info to themselves. You're not wrong with how you feel, not at all. I've personally had backlash MULTIPLE TIMES from talking about things that happened to me. It's incredibly difficult and my mental health suffered possibly more from the backlash than the rape. And I believe that ppl need support and lots and lots of therapy to get through these things, so if you're not in therapy now plz go, you need it I promise you need it. But to say that it's entirely ok to not help children not go through what you went through? No, I don't believe that. If you're not in a place to do that right now, I get it. But be actively getting to that place. Save your own life then save others. I don't believe it's helpful to tell ppl that it's OK to stay down at your lowest point. Was it hard when I came forward to my family, the police, the prosecutor, my exes, and wasn't believed or had it used against me? Oh yes. I can't begin to describe that pain. But I wouldn't take it back, not ever, and even though it didn't appear that I was believed about my childhood SA, I do believe that ultimately it added to the pile of reasons the majority of my family cut this person out of our lives, so the kids in my family including my daughter are safe from him. I finally accepted that I didn't need verbal validation that I was believed because the most important outcome was achieved regardless and I know I spoke up and did the right thing. The ppl who didn't support me have to clean up their side of the street because on this issue, mine is clean. 

As a victim I don't condone victim blaming nor sacrificing the victims mental health. But as a parent I can't condone victims letting themselves stay forever silent and afraid, and sacrificing more kids. If you're in a place where speaking out would affect you because you're directly affected by him still, for your own sake get out of there. You'll never be able to breathe if you stay anywhere where he can affect your life. Go to a support group and get some ppl in your circle who understand and aren't involved in this mess so they can have your back.

Work towards a life where you can see yourself as the strong, brave, resilient woman you are and can make decisions about this not based around fear and shame. 

The saying is very true that you have to put on YOUR oxygen mask before you can help anyone else put on there's. Put on your mask and just see how you feel about this when you can breathe again.

About the coaching, my main point is that you should strive to have more women engage in coaching sports, because there is a vast deficiency, or at the very least expand your opinions to account for this. If I simplify it thusly, hopefully there is little to remark of it. A bout of realism rather than my whole ado about confronting your opinion (because we shouldn't abolish sports for girls and it takes time to find and educate coaches)."," A joke filled with spite leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

Your message reeks of hipocrisy, because you are dictating my grasp on humour and calling me a Karen, while this is based upon false presumptions of a stranger. I remain neutral and objective.

You keep talking around my point and grasping for straws and just like the other commenter, provide no substance, but spite. You do not have to remind me of sarcasm, as I have - now multiple times - confirmed that I get that it was sarcasm (which, again, should have been obvious in the first message).

23504,f3amwau,comment,,"I’m kinda late to the discussion so I don’t know if my viewpoint has been discussed yet, but I feel to tell you a few things. Some may sound harsh and others to hopefully help you.

I’m a NICU nurse and can tell you that your actions likely led to your daughter to be born preterm. I’m guessing she was extremely preterm for the fact she is blind, probably related to ROP (retinopathy of prematurity). ROP usually affects babies born extremely early who need ventilator support and the use of oxygen. Eight years ago we (medical community) didn’t really screen regularly nor paid attention to oxygen concentrations given to infants. This related to a higher incidence of ROP. At my hospital now, these infants get screened bi-weekly to weekly until discharge and some follow-up in clinic. Our ROP numbers have significantly dropped with the help of new protocols, medications and laser procedures. 

I said all this because even though your daughter was born premature, that doesn’t mean you’re the direct cause of her being blind. I tell parents all the time that having a preterm baby isn’t always their fault. Being a teen increases your risk of having a premature baby. Yes, smoking increases your chance as well as poor nutrition but they aren’t necessarily the main causes. 

Don’t beat yourself up on it anymore, it sounds like you have hurt yourself enough. I can personally tell you from another person who suffers from mental illness, it’s not worth focusing on the negatives but rather the positives. Think of where she is now, a loving, caring home. I think that’s great you’re continuing to get support and should continue to seek help. Thank you for telling us the story as I’m sure it was hard to do. Good luck in your nurse training. Please, don’t be afraid to send a message if you have questions or just need a positive pick-me-up."," I’m kinda late to the discussion so I don’t know if my viewpoint has been discussed yet, but I feel to tell you a few things.

I blame this on the lack of sexual education in the US and the climate pro-lifers and traditional Christians has created surrounding abortion. Of course no one wants to go through an abortion, that's traumatic both mentally and physically in itself. But things like this can happen to teenagers who don't know any better and are scared of how their families are going to react - and that's not their fault. Kids aren't meant feel forced to deal with situations like that alone.

I was very blessed to have grown up with parents who taught me about safe sex and being responsible, and who would have been supportive of me whether I had chosen an abortion or carried on with the pregnancy. I always knew I could talk to my mom no matter what, and she wouldn't get angry. I haven't had a single pregnancy scare as a result since I started being sexually active. That is how I wish everyone was raised, but the world isn't a fair place.

I was on birth control at the time but I was given antibiotics and didn’t know they could make the pill ineffective, and I got pregnant. The father was older, abusive, involved in drugs. Kinda bad guy cool at the time but NOT a good selection as a father or partner in parenting.  I know some people select great boyfriends at sixteen but I was not one of those people. 


I guess I just want you to know that all of those things went through my head too. I just had no idea how to handle it and absolutely couldn’t believe it happened to me. You have this stupid mentality as a teenager...you think the cautionary tales happen to someone else...nothing that bad will ever happen to you. I just didn’t have the mental capacity to understand risk properly yet. I can look back and see it so clearly now.  Just like yours, my mind went places I am not proud of and have never admitted outside my own head before. Sheer panic in a mind that had no capacity to process the situation in an even remotely productive way. It all boiled down to “How do I get out of this.” 



I get what you said about not really grasping that the baby was...real, I guess. It was like it was something that was happening to ME, the only person I had the brain development to preserve at the time. Although I don’t think like this now, again, I can clearly remember having this state of mind.  I was a kid. My world and my thinking were small. I felt bad about this for a long time and finally had to forgive that kid because ruining the adult she became over the guilt just didn’t make any sense anymore. 




I almost had an abortion but didn’t. I kept him and raised him the best I could. I know it wasn’t enough, because I just didn’t have it. I cared and loved him and tried and worked but we were always so poor, I was immature and had to grow up with him, that’s not ideal for a kid. I’ve gotten a lot of praise for working full time, finishing college as a HS dropout while raising my son, and sure, it was better than the alternative but no matter what anyone says, there is no way to do all of that and be the presence your child needs in their life. There just aren’t enough hours.  It’s just not enough. 



I’m not entirely sure what my end point is here. I guess I wanted to say I KNOW what it’s like to be trapped like that. How your little animal brain kicks in and stops making sense and some really bad things become viable options. Just know that even if you make all the “right” decisions, it doesn’t mean everything is all sunshine and roses.  Babies and kids are terribly fragile and we can hurt them in a million ways, intentionally or unintentionally. Yes, you most likely hurt that baby in some way, you know this and you feel genuine remorse for it.  Hindsight is 20/20 and I can now see all the ways I fucked up as a parent. But I did the best that I could with the tools that I had at the time. I did. I can say that in all truthfulness. You did the best that you could with the tools you had at the time too. I know others won’t agree with that but it’s what everyone does, you just have the tools you have and you work on getting more as you grow. People are so different- there is no way anyone has the same set at the same time in life.  Especially at 15. And yours were bad. That doesn’t make you bad. I’m so sorry you had shitty tools at the time and I’m heartbroken for your child and I’m heartbroken for you. I hope you come to the point, as I did, where destroying the adult to punish a decision made as child just doesn’t make sense anymore.  Sounds like you’re working on that.

23535,f39odfx,comment,,"Wow.... I kinda understand what you mean. Me and my ex had our first baby gir, I was 18 and she was 20. So we got married because I thought it was the right thing to do. And I told myself that no matter what, I would always be there for my daughter.... I’d move mountains if I had to. Then exactly 2 years and a day.... our son was born. And yes... their birthdays are the 9 & 10th of March... so literally, 2 years and a day apart. 
Having kids this young, really put a stop to our 20’s. We didn’t go out like we used to, the partying stopped and I wasn’t ready for that but I had to make sacrifices for my babies. But my ex didn’t see it like that.... she left the 5 of us and never came back.(me, daughter, son, Starsky &  Hutch).... our 2 German Shepard’s ...
She’s has been gone since... no calls, no letters .... not a dam thing for her at all!!!...She 
Then shortly after leaving signed over all parental rights and a “No Contest” divorce. She didn’t want anything of mine... because my house was mine before we met. And so was all my money. We didn’t share a bank account. She had hers and I have mine. I didn’t even get her any credit cards.... I started to realize that I couldn’t trust her anymore.... so I finally said fuck it. I haven’t seen or heard from that asshole in about 4 years. Now both my kids are almost teenagers and doing awesome. I got remarried about 3 years ago and my kids know the real story about everything but they call my new wife mom and they love her and respect her so much.  My advice.... if you think you too young to have kids.... USE SOME FUCKING RUBBERS, get the morning after pill or some other preventive pregnancy shit.... you should be ashamed of your self for trying,, probably everything you could think of to harm that baby. When the reality of it is... you probably only needed to kill yourself, and game over.... but I honestly do t believe that an expecting mother could ever do that. I understand families who are hardcore religious junkies. And I understand you may feel too young. We all feel too young.... you wanna know something..... 
let me tell ya... I spent a long time alone, no help at all with my kids. When their mom left, they were just a little over 2 and about to turn 1. I was 20 years old.... I thought about giving them up....  it as soon as I thought that.... someone heard me, and they both turned around and came over to me and said.... “ I love you daddy” for no reason. I knew right then, if I let them go.... I probably wouldn’t ever hear their voices say that to me ever again.... I didn’t want that at all.... I wanted to hear that for the rest of my life.  I did everything I had to do to make every work and it definitely wasn’t easy.... but if I can do it without anyone and have 2 kids..... I think your gonna be just fine. 

Good luck.... hopefully next time, you will think twice about fucking without protection... and just a heads up... I’m a MD state police Detective. And in this state, if you did any of what you just literally talked about.... you would have most definitely been arrested. I’m not even gonna talk about what charges could have been brought up but just know.... they fucking sux... bad!!! 
I really hope you’ve changed and you should really try to connect with your child.... even if you think they are not gonna recognize you.... trust me on this.... to a child, a mothers face is something all of us orphans will remember for the rest of our lives. And if you honestly believe that your kid may resent you or hate you.... that’s something your gonna have to just take from them. Because now they are sifting through buck after buck of emotions... and while they are, just give them the space they need/want.  But when they find a old picture of you and your kid.... ALL OF THEIR MEMORIES ARW GONNA HIT THEM ALL AT ONCE LIKE A HUGE TIDAL WAVE CRASHING DOWN ON THEM.... the same thing will happen to you.... just don’t ever try to justify why/ what you did to let them go.... and most importantly.... don’t try to be their mom or dad.... that parents ship sailed a very long time ago when you made the choice that suited you, not what was best for your child. You might be one of the lucky ones who are privileged to hear their kids call you mom or dad....

23549,f39lrwd,comment,,"I think your statement that 

*""smoking and diet do not inevitably cause premature birth""*

is incredibly dangerous and misleading. God forbid anyone uses your comment as a way to justify their behaviour, or to convince themselves that it will be ok. The FACT is that there is a higher percentage of complications in women who smoke during pregnancy, regardless of your specific case.

THAT BEING SAID, I did take an exam once where the question was ""What is the cause for alternative outcomes in two different women who DRINK during pregnancy, one resulting in a healthy child and the other resulting in malformation?""

Im making the question shorter than it was, because in actuality they presented us with two clinical cases. One was of a mother who ALWAYS drank, and kept drinking through pregnancy, the other women NEVER drank and only had three glasses of wine at chrismas. The unhealthy baby was born to the Christmas drinker.

At the time I got the question wrong and almost failed the exam, but the right answer was that the cronic drinker had developed alcohol tolerance. Her liver had grown accustomed to creating the enzimes that break down alcohol, and the genes that coded for these enzymes were more active, so at any given time she had SOME of these enzymes at the ready, already made. The women that only drank at christmas didnt have this tolerance, didnt have these enzymes, didnt degrade the alcohol before it was past to the baby via placenta, and her baby was affected. 

While this is an example involving drinking, I immagine nicotine/tobacco tolerance is some what the same. And the poster said that she STARTED smoking when she got pregnant, so she didn't have this tolerance pre established.

IDK if anyone found this interesting, but I immediately thought of it when I read your comment."," I think your statement that

is incredibly dangerous and misleading. God forbid anyone uses your comment as a way to justify their behaviour, or to convince themselves that it will be ok. The FACT is that there is a higher percentage of complications in women who smoke during pregnancy, regardless of your specific case.

THAT BEING SAID, I did take an exam once where the question was ""What is the cause for alternative outcomes in two different women who DRINK during pregnancy, one resulting in a healthy child and the other resulting in malformation?""

Im making the question shorter than it was, because in actuality they presented us with two clinical cases. One was of a mother who ALWAYS drank, and kept drinking through pregnancy, the other women NEVER drank and only had three glasses of wine at chrismas. The unhealthy baby was born to the Christmas drinker.

At the time I got the question wrong and almost failed the exam, but the right answer was that the cronic drinker had developed alcohol tolerance. Her liver had grown accustomed to creating the enzimes that break down alcohol, and the genes that coded for these enzymes were more active, so at any given time she had SOME of these enzymes at the ready, already made. The women that only drank at christmas didnt have this tolerance, didnt have these enzymes, didnt degrade the alcohol before it was past to the baby via placenta, and her baby was affected. 

While this is an example involving drinking, I immagine nicotine/tobacco tolerance is some what the same. And the poster said that she STARTED smoking when she got pregnant, so she didn't have this tolerance pre established.

 Graduated high school two years early. Got a shitty fast food job the day I was old enough to, and was on my own paying my own rent at 15, just before turning 16. Got my drivers license the day I turned 16. 

I was working full-time in banking, by age 17. & Bought my first home on my own at age 19. I busted my ass to do what I had to do. Not necessarily easy, but you have to do whatever it takes. 

The pastor which is my son‘s grandfather, told my sons father to abandon me and my son. Because it was an embarrassment to their church congregation and family. To this day, they have nothing to do with him; even though they only live several miles away. Pretty pathetic. 

 But he has turned into the most fine, upstanding young man I could ever ask for. He really has. Responsible, a beautiful soul, and incredibly amazing in every way. So, fuck them. Don’t need them.

The OP also directly states in the post that her blindness was a result of her extreme prematurity. ROP is the most common cause of blindness in children in many parts of the world.

23701,f3ao4k7,comment,,"I’m always amazed by how easy people think it is to just up and get hormones, especially for kids. It’s fucking hard to get prescribed as an adult, teenagers are rarely prescribed them, and only after lots of checks and hoops to jump through.

From the stats you mentioned, somewhere from 35-75% are sure of their gender and do not ‘grow out of it’ - why would we force them to undergo permanent and harmful changes that could easily be avoided? 

Imagine being old enough to know who you are but not being trusted to make even a temporary decision about your own body. Watching your body change against your will, hating yourself more every day. You can get treatments or surgeries as an adult, but there’s no guarantee they will be effective, or 100% safe, or that you won’t be left with scars.

Fucking and dating your second cousins requires a certain amount of responsibility. Honestly, as long you're honest with your family and play it off maturely, you can pull it off.

Simply say you feel more comfortable dating within the family, and that you prefer that family's money stay within the family.

Nowhere in your post have you considered how horrible it must feel to be treated with disgust due to your appearance. I would say that your ""focus"" is unimportant compared to the pain that these beliefs are likely to inflict on others.

This makes you come across as self-centred and lacking in empathy. You seem more concerned with your own vanity than about the potential impact of your racism on others.

23728,dokkplf,comment,,">I'm not hurting anyone in my life on account of this problem.

As someone who rarely sees or interacts with Asians, I'm not suggesting that you are hurting people in your life right now. But what happens when you do have to deal with Asian people and your facial expression momentarily reveals disgust? What happens when you unintentionally ignore, devalue, avoid or sneer? You've already admitted to rooting for another team due to your revulsion at the ""effeminate"" appearance of a Vietnamese sports team. Maybe they sensed your disgust, maybe they didn't. Sooner or later, someone will. My point was that you don't seem to care about this possibility, you only seem to care about your own sense of peace. In my opinion, this reflects self-centredness and lack of empathy.

>I'm not a child of Sklavenmoral, and I am not responsible for how other people choose to feel about an internet post.

I don't believe anyone is responsible for how anyone else feels. However, you are aware that ""chinky-looking"" people will read your unnecessarily vivid descriptions of the traits that cause you such revulsion, and may ""choose"" to feel badly. You could have just as easily expressed yourself in a way that was less likely to offend people. You chose not to. This suggests that the feelings of others are not particularly important to you. You would rather pepper your posts with racial slurs, than give thought to the feelings of your readers.

>[...]visceral reaction of utter disgust I see when I look at picture of the likes of Elliot Rodgers' victims: [photo]

What is the point of sharing this image? Do you expect readers to see these photos and understand your feelings of disgust? You have already established (vividly) that you feel revulsion at the sight of East Asian men. Posting more examples won't further your argument, it will only risk causing pain to those who look like the men in the photos.

>I'm not trying to build myself as a pitiful character fishing for sympathy.

That's clear. However, you are asking for *help* with the experience of an emotion (disgust), but don't demonstrate empathy or compassion yourself. Why would anyone else be concerned with your own sense of ""balance"" or ""soundness of mind"", when you present yourself as someone who doesn't care about the feelings of others?

More to the point, I believe that pain can only be overcome by learning to see its circumstances in a more positive or pragmatic light. The perception of pain is lessened when its cause seems necessary or worthwhile. Since you don't seem to care about the potential impact of your racist beliefs to the Asians you interact with, the pain of challenging these beliefs and *effectively* moderating your response is not worthwhile. This is why I say that compassion for others is necessary to overcome racism.

>Your post is all fine and dandy, but it's not actually offering me a way to anyhow overcome this. Platitudes and general catchphrases that reek of Sklavenmoral like ""oh, build compassion"" are implausible solutions.

I'm afraid I don't know what Sklavenmoral is, nor could I grasp it from a quick reading online. I gather that you think it's a negative thing.

I apologise if my argument seemed shallow. My point was that your disgust could be mitigated by an appreciation of the pain it may inflict on others. If you cared about the potential impact of your racist beliefs on others, you might be more willing to tolerate the experience of seeing Asian people."," >I'm not hurting anyone in my life on account of this problem.

23744,dcvmowq,comment,,"Haha so all dates are a form of prostitution? If that's your idea of logical thinking, I don't know what to tell you. If we're blurring boundaries, how about this one: rape shouldn't be treated any different from just regular assault, because it's a form of physical violence. Is it REALLY different just because a penis makes contact with a vagina, rather than, say, a fist with a face? I don't think this, obviously, but this is pretty much exactly the kind of false equivalence you're proposing.

Not saying marrying someone for money is necessarily better. But  there are host of issues with a single mother prostituting herself that you seem to gloss over. Not to mention the fact that the man is married. But again, you can dodge any kind of moral dilemma by doing all sorts of mental gymnastics, i.e., ""if I didn't do it, someone else would! Therefore, I did nothing wrong!""

Practically, this is just stupid. It's not a real job, therefore it isn't secure. Really not a good solution to financial instability. The man could be sleeping with other prostitutes, which could bring STIs into the equation. Or what if the wife finds out and she sets out to destroy OP's life and ""out"" her? Not an uncommon scenario. Oh and it's also illegal. 

I wonder what OP would say about her own daughter (if she had one) prostituting herself. Would she approve, saying it's a viable source of income?

Lastly, it's just straight up trashy. I know all the third wave pseudo feminists will come out of the woodwork, citing some celebrity ""sex worker's"" blog post about how sex work is actually super empowering and that it actually doesn't objectify women at all! (Who woulda thunk it!) But really, parents should strive to be able to the type of people their children can look up to, people who are committed to creating the type of world their child will someday live in. Whoring yourself out for a thousand bucks to some sad married dude cheating on his wife is probably not the way to go. Is it really too much to ask that a parent be able to stand tall in front of their children, instead of skulking around for extra cash like some sewer rat?

Unlike /u/thefrostbite thinks, money does change everything. Money makes you beholden to something, whether you care to admit it or not. It creates a very specific type of transactional relationship that can exert the kind of invisible influence that, well, only money can exert.

Or maybe OP is just super progressive/empowered feminist. In which case she should have no problem being open about this socially, in front of her kid, who she should raise to also be so ""open-minded"" about prostitution.

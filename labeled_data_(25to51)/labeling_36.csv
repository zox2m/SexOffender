Also why do you keep booking appointments and follow-ups with NPs if you don’t trust their advice and recommendations? Why not wait to see an MD if you trust them more? 

All industries have competent and incompetent members, so it’s terribly unfair for you to insinuate that all NPs are bad. 
I think it’s always best to approach any healthcare professional with clear and straightforward information without any speculation or recommendation or challenge. They can only help you based on what you tell them. They are not mind readers.

In the end of they can't answer questions or explain WHY they recommend what they do/are, then you need to seek another opinion or specialist and find consensus.

NP'S have to have a minimum threshold of hours before they can even apply to an NP program, and the admission requirements (grades, and clinical hours/ requirements) are pretty stringent from what I remember a friend talking about. And that's after they finished a 4 year undergrad (similar to doctors, 4year under grad, 4 years of med school) and before they begin working on their doctorate or masters in nursing",14,,2025-01-17 10:53:04,t1_m7lnrjf,,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1i38y9b/every_nurse_practitioner_ive_had_has_misdiagnosed/m7lxxlh/,Neutral

Far less knowledge there to inform their decisions when it comes to caring for their patients. They are NOT on the same level as an MD. 

The MD who is supposed to oversee the NP patient reports is always overworked, too. One actual MD skimming 12 or 15 different NP's written reports for every patient? There's not enough time in the day... that's assuming the NP wrote things up well enough, that they were able to identify the important information.

The system evolved this way because an NP is far far cheaper than an MD for these medical conglomerates to employ. Standard of care down the toilet in favor of pushing more and more patients thru faster and faster. It's sad."," Everybody is giving you shit about this or that, but I sympathize with you.

It was raining and he was trying to get home before the 9 pm curfew that 16-year-olds had for driving in New York State.  He was from upstate New York, all narrow roads and farm country.  Anyway he was hauling azz on a narrow windy road and the car went one way and his tires another - hydroplaned.  He hit a telephone pole that came down between him and his passenger right in the middle of the car.  He had to buy the state and phone company a new pole.  They both walked away with now injuries.  Extremely lucky.  We went back several years ago and they had moved the pole to the other side of the curve.  I wonder if someone else hit it.  We always joke it’s his pole.

No one judges you as harshly as you do yourself and honestly most people are too self-absorbed (esp at a gym!) to recognize you! Don’t be your OWN enemy! Life is often untidy, embarrassing, unexpected… but you own your life so don’t let other’s negative energy bring you down! You are hardly the first person to fall at the gym and anyone being judgy should probably take a look at themselves! I hope you’re physically OK and you do go back!

21289,m7e1fb8,comment,,"I would be mortified too. Being embarrassed is the worst feeling in the world and I struggle not to cry when I'm embarrassed, which only makes it worse. It's really normal to feel embarrassed about this. That being said, others are right when they asked what you would think if you saw someone fall like you had? Because I would be so far away from laughing at them, I would be worried they were injured, I would ask if they were okay or needed a hand, but if I see someone fall over I'd never find it funny or judge them for it. I think any good person would feel that way.

Also, who knows if any of the people in the gym will be in the gym with you again or if they would recognise you. I probably wouldn't remember something like that for long, and what the person looked like even less so. So if it helps at all, wear your hair differently and wear a different outfit for the next couple of times you go. I doubt anyone would look twice at you anyway, but if you are feeling awkward maybe it would help. How often do you remember what a stranger you saw in passing looks like beyond their hair and clothing?

You're doing a great job going to the gym and I hope that you don't let this scare you away from continuing that journey. If you need to take some time and do home work outs for a week or two, you can do that, but try to remind yourself that if anyone noticed, it's really unlikely that anything other than concern crossed their mind and they'll probably forget about it pretty quickly.

It hurt like a bitch and it was bleeding. The scab still hasn’t healed. But I finished my workout. Yes, it was very embarrassing. A man quickly came over to help and all that. Quite the show.

but what the fuck, oh well, fuck it . I was ashamed for a bit but I started the belt right back up and kept running and convinced myself that it never happened. 

I’ve also gone down for a weighted squat on the rack and ripped my pants right through the buttocks and my ass & panties were out for the world to see (I only wear thongs) . A quick run to the desk & bought some overpriced gym branded leggings saved the day, and I was back to the workout 

Now that i think about it , I’ve had so many embarrassing moments. If you’re really gonna stick to it , you might have as many as me haha.

Storytime: So I was in the gym working out after I had tried Starbucks hot chocolate, (I know terrible). I was already tired but wanted to still get at least a 15-20min workout. I pushed through and kept going. On my 2nd set, I was doing squats with I think (35's) on each end of the barbell. There were others nearby on the other machines. I lowered myself and must have step wrong because I felt my right ankle fold outward and I buckled, (still not sure how that happened) as I fell to the ground with the barbell, I felt my back hit the ground and I let out the loudest fart I've ever heard from myself. People came rushing but it was like this awkward silence in the background. I laid there embarrassed and looking at people as they crowded to ask it I was OK. They really looked concerned as if the fart didn't matter, but I was concerned about it. I knew I was not gonna be OK unless I laugh it out. So as they helped me up while others staring at me, I said we'll damn, fuck that happen for? Hot chocolate got my ass all loud, ankles all fucked up and everyone including myself bust out laughing, several of them said glad you're OK, it happens to the best of us. 

All to say, embarrassments are gonna happen sometimes build your resilience through laughter and acceptance that it's OK. If that makes sense.

I’m a pretty fit guy and have been going to the gym since I was 16. (approaching my 40s now) Among my friends and myself there isn’t one of us who from when they started and up until recently haven’t had some embarrassing moments. And everyone has at least one of these involving a treadmill at some point.

Most properly experienced gym goers do not look down on the unfit or new joiners. We see it as a fresh recruitment to our tribe, and we are excited to follow their progress. I usually think when I see new joiners: “good for you, you made the first step” and my next thought is usually: “please don’t start too hard” cause that means I likely will not see you here next month. Living healthy, loosing weight and building muscle takes a long time and a lot of commitment. People who commit too hard in the beginning only feel the pain and not the reward.
That being said the world is full of jerks. I wouldn’t worry about what they think.

Taking it easy shouldn’t keep you from trying to break your own records, that’s half the fun. But your body’s performance varies from day to day, setting a new record every time is just not feasible. Take your time and have fun. The record smashing day is best when it  feels easy, not when you force yourself into dangerous situations to achieve it."," Sorry for long post:

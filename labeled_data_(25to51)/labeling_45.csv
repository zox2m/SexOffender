25984,m7rnq3i,comment,,"Happy belated birthday!! Glad you decided to stick around a little longer. 

I always look at life like this… death is guaranteed already and will be eternal so u may as well see your life through until the end because each day has the opportunity to show or bring you something new. 

Our lives are a short blip in time anyway so what is the point of ending it early? I’ve learned that one day can feel hopeless and pointless, only for the next to take my breath away. Your post is another solid example of this and so I am so glad you stuck around to experience that for yourself. You never know who you will meet, what amazing thing is right around the corner, or what joy may be just coming up in the horizon. Checking out early makes sure you will never find out. 

Loneliness can make us feel desperate and like we have zero alternatives…  but there are many others out there that feel the same who would like to have a “you” in their life. Keep searching and maybe by the time your next birthday or two come around again you will have someone to celebrate it with. If the people in your life right now don’t appreciate you then it’s a sign to seek new connections and keep doing so until you find one that does feel good. They are out there right now doing the same thing, and trying to find you.  ;)"," Happy belated birthday!! Glad you decided to stick around a little longer.

25989,m7rnwas,comment,,"Aw babe, I hope I'm not too late in celebrating your birthday celebration here on reddit!! Happy birthday!!! 🎂🥳 🎈 

You sound like a very sweet and genuine person. You have done nothing wrong and absolutely deserve to have a beautiful day celebrating another year of your life. 

Please stop calling yourself a terrible person. I often struggle expressing my emotions and putting them into words and have been accused of being insincere and cold despite describing my true feelings. I understand how you feel as I had spent my entire birthday last year all alone due to my husband being literally left at work where he had to spend the night.

 We renovate houses for a living so he was stuck at a job site due to his ride deciding to get drunk not bother picking him up despite it being my birthday. I was so depressed that I cried all day long.

 We've literally lost all of our belongings and our home (long story but basically our landlord was our old boss who completely screwed us over on a verbal contract and in the process locked us out and literally stole all of our property) and 2 years later we're still struggling so we couldn't afford to actually celebrate my birthday much less get anything for my birthday which was fine. I don't need much. 

I just wanted my husband to at least spend the day with me, that would have been a gift enough but instead our business partner who drives us to each job site ruined my entire day. He's good at that though. He also ruined our 10 year anniversary which I spent most of the day alone. I definitely understand how horrible it feels to spend a day —that most people are surrounded by loved ones showing how much they care for them— completely alone to where no one remembers it's even a special day or that you don't have anybody to spend special days with.

I was lucky I got Christmas with my husband but dealing with homelessness and living at job sites is definitely taking a toll on me. Your post really hit my heart and knowing how painful loneliness feels along with looking into your past at all your failures trying to figure out why you're so forgettable and disposable, I know all that too well. You don't deserve any of that and you DO matter! It's what I tell myself every day to keep pushing through, holding onto the hope that this year will be different and things will be better. 

So repeat after me **I am NOT a terrible person and I deserve better!** Because it's true and your story gives me more hope because things are already getting better for you so maybe they will for me too. Please go to that concert and have the time of your life!! You deserve it and you only live once!!! Don't take it for granted, we truly ARE all rooting for you hon ❤️🫂 Enjoy your birthday 🥂😊"," Aw babe, I hope I'm not too late in celebrating your birthday celebration here on reddit!!

This was after my divorce. We were having a group chat in a public forum I had created on depression. He was a kind stranger who was concerned about a lonely stranger. For some reason, I trusted to give him my phone number. I never had before done this nor have I since. 

He called and we chatted a little while and he got me to calm down and stop crying. He then asked if he could sing me a song. He broke into this lovely melody that was a very well-known song from just before my time. I told him he was fantastic and asked if he had ever thought of pursuing a career in music. He, after all, did live in California. He heartily laughed and said that he indeed had done just that. His name was Scott McKenzie and had just sung me this song (maybe you've heard of it):

When I was 18 I had hundreds of “friends” on Facebook, my birthday posted for everyone to see. Only 6 people in my life or online wished me a happy birthday. A little over 10 years later and I turned 30 during Covid. I only hung out with 6 of my closest friends and family but it was everything I wanted. 

I’ve taken several solo trips and been to many concerts by myself, including some of my favorite bands. Those concerts are some of my favorites. If nothing else you can gift those tickets to some Coldplay super fans and make new friends.

All I’m saying is to keep moving forward. Life can be a struggle but small moments with strangers are the type of memories that keep you going through the tough times. Don’t give up my friend

I want to tell you that you are amazing. Happy birthday🎉! I know how it feels, and I can relate. I was alone in Boston, far from my country, on my 27th birthday. I didn’t know anyone—no friends or family in the city. No one called me that day. The next day, my parents called to wish me a happy birthday; they were the only ones.

I’m not really someone with many friends, so I would have been surprised if anyone had remembered my birthday—but no one did. That day, I felt truly alone and far from my family. For me, it was supposed to be my most special birthday because my birthday is March 27, so in my mind, I thought turning 27 would make it the best birthday. But it turned out to be the worst.

A few months later, I met my husband, and the following year (my 28th birthday) was the first time someone prepared a celebration for me that wasn’t my parents.

As a fun fact, when I was alone, I turned to Bumble, an app to meet people for friendship, since I knew I wouldn’t be in the city for long. Over time, I had to return to Boston several times because my husband lived there. Now we live in Seattle.

Just remember, if you ever visit Seattle, you’ll have friends here who will be happy to show you around the city. 🏙️","

When I have been in your situation I remember one thing that brings me some solace!  

I don’t have people, but people have me!  It gets lonely sometimes, but I let it comfort me that I know that I’m there for people when they need me and usually it doesn’t get reciprocated, but people know it!  Atleast you will know that you were a comforting soul to others in their time of need!

But here in this moment we are ALL totally rooting for you and love you!

Happy birthday and livestream the concert and we will all somehow FaceTime or something…has to be a way!!!

This has happened to me too and I’m so sorry you are going through this you have all my empathy 

I have felt this way too and it fucking sucks when people forget your birthday. It says nothing about you and everything about them. A lot of people are very selfish and self absorbed and want the benefits you provide in a relationship but don’t want to contribute. They are one sided and fair weather friends. Shame on them. 

It’s okay to tell the people you are close to how they have hurt you- you can be kind and firm. 

It gets better and our brains lie to us.

I had just gotten divorced and felt lonelier than I ever had and felt like a huge failure. I thought that at 28 I’d have everything figured out and I didn’t. Not at all. 

Things got better. And I learned a lot and saw more beautiful things and made more friends and fell in love again. 

I’m 41 now, just out of a 7 year relationship, jobless, and back living with my folks. This is all due to an illness that took away so much that I was going to accomplish, and all of my retirement.

Life can be really shitty sometimes and sometimes it feels like it’s never going to get better. And it’s okay to feel defeated and lonely and sad and angry and all of those things. You did the right thing in reaching out. The next step is to reach out to someone you know in person or by phone. Ask a trusted friend or family member for help. It may be one of the hardest things to do, but once you open up to them, I guarantee that you will feel just a little bit lighter.  And you will be stronger for it.

I stopped relying on FB and Twitter/X for my ‘friend quotient’ about 15 years ago. ‘People’ on these platforms are as fake as they appear. I stopped because a PASTOR told me I should go kill myself because he didn’t agree with my political leaning. We don’t need these people. (Or bots, or whatever.) 

Go find your real friends. You know who they are. Don’t base your entire existence on someone not wanting to go to a concert with you. Maybe, they aren’t a big fan of Coldplay. Or concerts. Or crowds. Real friends can sit across from you at a diner and not say a single word the whole time you are there. But, you feel like you had a full conversation. 

I feel you. The world is upside-down. What if one day you are responsible, either directly or indirectly, for saving someone else’s life? Don’t throw away your chance to be a legend over someone else’s scheduling issues."," 🎼This is your birthday song. 🎵 It isn’t very long. 🎶

26062,m7rq37y,comment,,"Happy birthday! There's something about 28th birthdays. Everyone asked what I wanted to do for my birthday and I said I'll just hang out with you guys. I had like six good friends and ones. Have a few drinks and we all have to get up early anyway. Blah blah blah well individually. They each called me throughout the days and they can't make it. They can't make it. So I'm thinking I must be getting a surprise party. My mom asked me if I wanted to go to dinner. I said nope. I'm going to hang out with my friends. I think they're having a surprise party for me lol. Boy was I wrong. I was bellyed up to the bar all alone. Not one person came to even have one drink or wish me a happy birthday. So all of a sudden my mom walked in and asked if I wanted to go to dinner and I went to dinner with her. I still feel bad cuz I said no at first but something about the 28th birthday. I was just shocked there was no party. There was nothing. They were serious. They just couldn't be bothered. 
Maybe it's time to find new friends it's around that age that you start losing the friends that aren't really true friends so filter some of them out that aren't truly friends and never ever risk your life for one moment of self-pity. It's not worth it ever. 
Best of luck and hope you have a wonderful birthday month!"," Happy birthday! There's something about 28th birthdays.

You sound terribly stuck in your own head, that can be one of the worst prisons anyone can be in. I’ve (27F) been in it before, stuck in my head, flooded with my irrational thoughts and negative feelings. Constantly thinking somethings wrong with me, everyone else doesn’t like me, no one else cares. 
But it’s not true, I’m not saying this is right for you but I went on antidepressants for a couple years to at least help me clear my mind and it worked. I’m no longer on them anymore and I have a clear head, I have understanding when people cancel, I don’t set too high expectations so if they’re not met, it’s not too disappointing. 
You hit walls like this sometimes and it sucks, but you’ll always get through it. Humans are VERY resilient but they’re also good at convincing themselves they’re not. 

I wish you all the best, I hope you can get through this, I’m sure you can with a bit of fight and determination. You can be strong, you can be successful, you can be happy and you will. I believe it.

See, I live close to the capital Berne and moved here from Italy and 10 years ago. I lived 10 years in Italy (Milan) before and moved to Italy from Germany. As consequence I lost my friends twice. Swiss people are like oysters: very closed, very reserved, they don’t open their circle for you.
Both my parents are dead so I am alone on my birthdays too and don’t receive anything. I feel you.
Loneliness is difficult to deal with but there are ways to bypass it. Sometimes I volunteer in a shelter for cats and dogs. Animals are wonderful: honest and faithful.

You ate not alone. Look at the feedback of your post. And in case you’re in Switzerland let me know and we have a beer together. Now go to that concert and enjoy the fantastic show cold play does.

26124,m7rseim,comment,,"Wow, how wonderful is it when the internet works in such a positive way!  That is like a breath of fresh air.  

First a Happy, Happy Birthday to You, Who YOU!!!

2nd-  Easy to say, yet very hard to do I had to realize human beings are selfish creatures.  so when I think of a friend that didn’t come through on plans we had and hasn’t gotten ahold of me I think of the fact that people think of them selves first, almost always.  So I’m sure they are busy with too many things at the same time.  I know that we all know what that feels like.  No one shows up late feeling all good about themselves (polite, nice people that are worth being around anyway) so I approach them with something like… is everything ok, what happened(?) and setting a nice and concerned tone is always the best approach to open communication.  It keeps each of us from getting defensive and wanting to attack each other verbally.  I let them know regardless of the lateness I am thrilled that we are still going to get to spend time together because that’s the truth.  The positives I can still see happening, so they can visualize it too.  

You’re going to get more of whatever it is in life that you put out there.  Talk to people crappy and that’s how they will talk back.  If you want people to be nice to you, you have to be nice to them.  End of story.  So let’s look at your post:  As I said earlier people are as self centered as you can get.  So you seem to feel like they are “doing” something to you by not calling and the truth of the matter is most likely they were busy, simply forgot and will feel totally bad about it.  If they don’t then those might not be your friend anyway.  Put yourself in the situation; you forget your friend’s birthday (not on purpose) and they call and are upset and kinda jump your shit.  Do you think you are going to “want to” (not do it because I’m obligated and if I don’t he will go off on me about it) call you next year?  If you called and were real, like You didn’t remember my birthday and it hurt my feelings because it felt like everybody did and I thought you and I were tighter.  You will get a whole different response.  Isn’t that more in line with the truth?  So like I think everyone should do, not just you, try to imagine how other people are feeling and how you approach people.  I swear people act and treat you one way and then want you to be all respectful, when they aren’t.  Not saying you do that, I’m saying everyone should work on it, me included but I believe you already know what I am trying to articulate.  Hope something in here was helpful.  Take Care and stay warm!  DO

If you can just empathize a little bit it will take you a long way down the road of relief by reframing your view of other people.  People will react to you in a more positive way.  If you do it sincerely or not they will know.

Know that it’s not you. You’re probably a fine person.. and who cares if you’re successful or not. What does that even mean, these days? There are plenty of “successful” people that are miserable shits and vice versa.

I still sometimes have those bad periods, but I am mostly numb now. All I can wish is for you to get therapy if possible and if you want to give life a chance, try to be more open with people and connecting, even online. I do have friends-teachers, but I think it's mostly my fault I never feel the need to stop isolating myself when I feel hurt by smallest details of people's withdrawal, as they don't really see me as someone much important nowadays. I struggle with social cues and I suspect my therapist could help me under why I feel the way I feel. 

You matter and your experience does too. I can't imagine how actually lonely you felt in this moment and I hope you can find someone who will share your interests and love, accept true you. Your vitiligo, while not easy to deal with because of our society, is actually really beautiful. I don't know details if that requires some additional care to skin, but you are beautiful and what really matters in situations are who this person is at heart. I wish we were friends, but online for a friendship is harder to maintain and you probably won't like me in reality too.

i was at a really bad point and i made the decision you're referring to in your post.... and survived. i don't know how really. i guess i was found in respiratory arrest and no one knows how long i was down. a lot of bad stuff happened and before and after then i was very isolated and lonely. i can't say i have a ton of friends now, years later, but i somehow found peace and would never make that choice i did 10 years ago. it might change day to day but even during my worst days i think ""well i could do that but someday it's going to happen anyway so lets see what happens today because i wont have that chance if i decide to end things"" and i embrace those experiences and chances to try things and as hard is it is try to work on finding something good out of it.

seems like you're getting a lot of comments and support but if you ever need to talk to a stranger don't hesitate to dm xx be safe and well and you'll be in my thoughts and i'll be thinking of you at that concert january 26 and i hope you post and update here or on your profile or the coldplay sub about how the show was!!!!!!!!! xx"," Happy Birthday!!!!

I’ve also realised over the years (I have a few more than you) that many people just don’t care for birthdays, not even their own. They don’t care whether people remember or not so they don’t really understand that some people do; and that some people get hurt when they are not remembered. 


Oh and another thing; Vitiligo is not a flaw! Absolutely not!! Do not think you are lesser or not worthy because of your vitiligo, or anything else for that matter. You are absolutely worthy of love and consideration. You just need to find the people who are worthy of your love, don’t waste it on people who take your kindness and caring and crumple it up to throw away. 

Work on your insecurity and realise your worth. You will find your people!

One last thing… I tried to end my life a long time ago. Did not see any way forward or any point in trying. I failed obviously and I was almost instantly relieved that I did. Life was tough for a while after, then got better, then worse and better again etc etc. There are still days that are tough but overall, I am so happy and there are soooo many days where I think “I am so very glad that I failed back then.” That includes the difficult days."," Happy birthday!

Your story and feelings resonate with some of my own from a younger age - not all for sure, but enough that, my friend, this will pass.  This is the darkest night before the dawn.  And speaking up was so courageous, reaching out to a world that's often dismissive or hostile - you did that, and I am so glad you've had a response. 

There's a lot to be met in your story, and it might be worth finding professional assistance to explore - I know that's hard and expensive and slow and a million other reasons why not, but consider it a gift to yourself that you'll take your self seriously.  There's a lot to unpack, but once the dots start joining together mentally (and a shit load of tears to release) you'll feel less like a cork on a stormy sea and more like an eagle above it.  Self-compassion is the hardest compassion, self-love is the hardest love, they're so lacking in so many.  You clearly have a big heart, and once you can open that to yourself, my friend, the light can return.

Self-compassion is the hardest compassion, self-love is the hardest love, they're so lacking in so many.  You clearly have a big heart, and once you can open that to yourself, my friend, the light can return.

I'm in the UK, no chance I'll join you for the gig, but please take up some of the others offers and go just as new friends or strangers and have an amazing night.  And post some photos! :)",2,,2025-01-18 9:01,t3_1i3oqiz,,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1i3oqiz/todays_my_28_birthday_and_i_am_going_to_end_it/m7ry0da/,Neutral

You have so much value in this world, and so much life left to live.  So much love and positivity to keep bringing to it.  You're not a taker, you're a giver.  You've given inspiration and hope.  You've given gratitude and relief.  

I've been in your shoes, at the same age.  I felt alone, I felt lost, I felt unloved, I felt unsuccessful.  I was ready to leave the world.  My fix might not work for you, but it did for me.  I kept telling myself just one one more day.  Just try for one more day.  Then a day came where I realized I wasn't living just to try for one more day.  I had forgot to only work for one more day, because it had turned around.  The love and positivity I put into the world came back to me, like yours did in this post.

I truly hope you enjoy that concert and the connections you may make with this post.  Even if you never read this.  You are loved by someone in America up way past his bedtime.

Also, I want to point out that when I put ""where is Coldplay"" into Google, it auto filled to ""Where is Coldplay playing on January 26th?""

You are loved. Friends and family come and go though. Sometimes people have to cut their family off because they realize that they aren't really for them. Love is hard though and that's why you feel like you do. Most people don't love and we go around feeling unloved and lonely. To love one another is to give your life for that person. I've never given my life to anybody, have you? Everybody has their own lives to live and most of us only think about ourselves. Hell I forgot my grandma's middle name. I barely know my friends and family like I want to and I think that's how it is for a lot of us. It takes time and work to actually show someone that you care and love them but don't think that your friends and family don't care about you. They do care. Your not the only person who feels like how you were feeling but you did one thing that I think people should do when they feel like that. You reached out. Nobody knows what the other person is going through and most people don't know every detail of your life. It's easy to forget someone's birthday and it's easy to expect someone to think about you. We all want someone to think about us. If you reach out more to other people though I guarantee you will start to see people more involved in your life. Show your friends and family that you care by taking the time to actually get to know them. Call them randomly. Ask them what's going in their life. Visit them. Grow closer to the people you want in your life and they will grow closer to you because they will see that you are a good person and a real friend and that's all anybody really wants. We expect that from others and maybe your friends and family feel the same way. My grandma complains to me that nobody calls her and that nobody cares if she hasn't heard from somebody in a while but she gets calls all the time. It's not everyday but you can't expect somebody to put you first every single day unless you're married. The one thing she never does though is reach out to others. She always expects people to reach out to her instead and there lies the problem. Just because somebody doesn't reach out doesn't mean they don't care. They have their own lives but sometimes you gotta reach out yourself. You be the person for others that you want somebody to be for you. That's what love is and if you give it freely you will start to receive it more so."," You're not a terrible person and nobody hates you.

I want to share my story because I was feeling the same years ago. It was my birthday and nobody was thinking about me not even my parents who forgot. I was thinking that I was useless and felt like nobody liked me. But it’s been a few years now and I’ve changed a lot.

Nowadays not much people wish me my birthday or think about me. I don’t really have much friends too. But I don’t care! I spent too much time waiting for others to be happy. But the truth is that you don’t need anybody to have fun or enjoy your life. I mean it’s your birthday, you want to do something special : GO! Have fun and enjoy this special day even if you’re alone. And who knows? Maybe you’ll meet some interesting people. 

And it’s never too late to meet new people and find the right people. A real friend will maybe not always be here for you (because they can be busy sometimes) but they will always support you and care about you. If you feel like it’s not the case with the ones you have, you can always find new friends. The world is big!

But please, take care of yourself because that’s the most important thing. You are valuable and the world needs you! I was also thinking about ending years ago but now it’s something I will never think about. Once you heal yourself, you see the real beauty of life and you enjoy it more than ever. 

I hope this helps and make sense too :) English isn’t my first language but I tried my best."," Happy birthday 🎂

Your gift  from me is a psychic reading.. I hope this brings you joy! 🥲 🙏
Ok, you're in the thick of your Saturn return, a time where a lot of creative people just can't stand the harsh edges of life and either overdose, or even take their lives.. But you were smart and brave, and reached out to the world!
This Reddit post is going to be a hugely pivotal moment in time as it marks the start a new life for you. New friends, new confidence, an awareness to be grateful for even the smallest things that bring a moment of joy, and to not focus on anyone who is rude or dismissive. 
This new confidence and gratitude is going to move you into your new career utilising your creative gifts!
You're also going to fall in love within the next 4 months! This will be a wonderful relationship, but your life partner is still a bit further down the path, with some more difficult lessons to learn before them. 
You may be tempted to succumb to depression and self harm again, but you will draw on new spiritual lessons and take the stronger path, leading you into yet more greater times than you would have ever imagined. If you see a Vipassana retreat, you will find many tools for getting through hard times if you gift yourself the ten days of practise there!
There will be losses and heartbreak, but you will overall have an unusually special life journey, filled with interesting companions and experiences! 

Congratulations on the first day of the rest of your life! 
With love 😘❤️ 🤗

26335,m7s0ult,comment,,"First off HAPPY BIRTHDAY Radyoz!!! 28 years old!? You’re so close to getting to your 30’s when life actually begins! 

I just want to say, I completely understand how you’re feeling. Your 20s can be such a hard, lonely, and confusing time. I’ve been there, and it was a struggle for me too. Growing up, I faced a lot bullying in school, a speech impediment, undiagnosed ADHD and autism that made me feel “different,” and a whole host of insecurities during puberty. I had buck teeth from sucking my thumb, gained weight, and, to top it off, ended up with a mullet when I wanted a “Rachel” haircut from Friends. It was a mess, and I felt like I couldn’t catch a break.

My 20s weren’t any easier. I dropped out of college, felt like a failure, and spent so much time comparing myself to others. I’d look around and think, “Why does everyone else have it figured out, and I don’t?” But here’s the thing—comparison is the thief of joy. You can’t compare your journey to anyone else’s because we’re all on different paths. It’s okay to be a late bloomer. It’s okay to take your time figuring life out.

Something clicked for me in my 30s. I started caring less about what other people thought and more about what made me happy. I stopped worrying about whether people remembered my birthday or if I had a lot of friends. I embraced who I was. Honestly, I’m 40 now, and I have one true friend. That’s it. And I’m okay with that. I’ve learned to love my own company, and that’s been life-changing.

In 2020, at 36, I went back to college. It wasn’t easy, but I did it. I earned my first degree in 2023, and I’m now working on my second and third. I also have a job I love, and even though I work from home and don’t have close office connections, I’m happier than I’ve ever been. Life doesn’t follow a straight path. It takes time to find your groove, and that’s okay.

It’s also okay to do things by yourself—go to a concert, eat at a restaurant, or just enjoy a quiet moment. If you’re feeling lonely, try finding an online community around something you love. For me, video gaming helped me connect with others. There are so many people out there who share your interests and are waiting to connect with someone like you.

Please know that what you’re feeling right now is normal. Your 20s can be really tough, but they’re not the end. You’re not alone, and your life has so much meaning. Be kind to yourself. Love your own company. Be the type of person you enjoy being around. When you do that, you’ll find that other people are drawn to you too.

It gets better. I promise. Give yourself a chance. You’re worth it."," First off HAPPY BIRTHDAY Radyoz!!! 28 years old!? You’re so close to getting to your 30’s when life actually begins!

26347,m7s1ddz,comment,,"Greetings from Asbury Park, New Jersey USA

First of all may peace be with you. Our cultures are very different, but the amazing part of this life is I can talk to anyone anywhere in the world at any time. I hope you find things amazing in life to stick around for. I appreciate vitiligo. I think different is better. So many small minded people you must be a tough nut to crack. Read Desiderata. 

I have 2 budgies that I let out of their cage every day, they hang out on or in the cage but they are free to fly around the room.. They are hilarious and bring a lot of joy once they realize you're not going to hurt them. Cheap to feed scraps of veggies pellets and seeds. My birds cages are 5 meters away and while I'm on the pc they are hitting my head with their wings flying. They are little brats and I'm thankful for them. 

Your city looks amazing.. I don't know what it's like there but here my town has recreational volleyball and it's a fun way to meet people. Music Venues, theater companies, gaming events, social clubs, lectures, restaurant openings - don't stop until you find places that you feel like you're welcome.

I want to come eat your people's food. I thrive on finding new tastes. I consider our local apple cider (Delicious Orchards, Colt's Neck) a gift to humanity and I treasure every sip. I hope you have a passion for trying new things. 

Keep your chin up young man, have your standards and keep them. Biggie's 10 crack commandments is truth. Don't trust anybody, don't tell them what you have or what your plans are, keep your business and your family separated. Please take care of yourself, try not to get scammed in your vulnerable state.

Happy birthday brother. I now will learn about your city because of you. I hope your wonder never ceases, that you find solace in the simplest parts of nature, and you find what you want in this life. Or the next. It doesn't end; you can't escape, you just do it all over again somewhere on the timeline in anther body. I think it's all a learning process. But maaannnn let it go. F the haters, find your fun again because we all have to go through it. It's not easy at times. It can hurt for many years. But the good times are worth the suffering, and sometimes you have to realize it's you that hurts you, put your mind in a better place, over the toxicity, and make the choice to do better.. 

Discord sounds amazing like you're in the next room. If you need to talk, I will listen. My grandfather's mind would be blown if he was alive today to use discord. Humanity is amazing don't bitch out and have something tasty. Get 2 birds."," Greetings from Asbury Park, New Jersey USA

First of all may peace be with you. Our cultures are very different, but the amazing part of this life is I can talk to anyone anywhere in the world at any time. I hope you find things amazing in life to stick around for. I appreciate vitiligo. I think different is better. So many small minded people you must be a tough nut to crack. Read Desiderata. 

I have 2 budgies that I let out of their cage every day, they hang out on or in the cage but they are free to fly around the room.. They are hilarious and bring a lot of joy once they realize you're not going to hurt them. Cheap to feed scraps of veggies pellets and seeds. My birds cages are 5 meters away and while I'm on the pc they are hitting my head with their wings flying. They are little brats and I'm thankful for them. 

Your city looks amazing.. I don't know what it's like there but here my town has recreational volleyball and it's a fun way to meet people. Music Venues, theater companies, gaming events, social clubs, lectures, restaurant openings - don't stop until you find places that you feel like you're welcome.

I want to come eat your people's food. I thrive on finding new tastes. I consider our local apple cider (Delicious Orchards, Colt's Neck) a gift to humanity and I treasure every sip. I hope you have a passion for trying new things. 

Keep your chin up young man, have your standards and keep them. Biggie's 10 crack commandments is truth. Don't trust anybody, don't tell them what you have or what your plans are, keep your business and your family separated. Please take care of yourself, try not to get scammed in your vulnerable state.

Happy birthday brother. I now will learn about your city because of you. I hope your wonder never ceases, that you find solace in the simplest parts of nature, and you find what you want in this life. Or the next. It doesn't end; you can't escape, you just do it all over again somewhere on the timeline in anther body. I think it's all a learning process. But maaannnn let it go.

I felt like I should continue spending on these ppl, just to have them in my life. 

Well, I was wrong. all you need is to look for that 1 person, a person who will stick with you through thick and thin, and once you find that person, you will realise that no one else matters, I found mine and I have never looked back or felt dejected again. 
My birthdays are celebrated at home, with a wonderful dinner at a good restaurant. We don't invite anyone else. I hv a few friends, but they too are just hi hello kaisa hai, etc. We don't meet up daily. It's a mercy we even meet up once a year. 

So hold on to hope dear friend, 
And remember, 
You don't need ""friends"" to enjoy life. 

You were born alone, you will go away alone, so why not enjoy life to the fullest ? Alone ? Why not?

I’m so so glad to see the edit at the bottom of your post and you still responding to comments, I’m so glad you are still here and I truly hope you keep it that way.

This post tells me that you are an amazing person, you have so much love to give to people, you care deeply for others, and it’s important to you that you are a good friend to others and want to be the best version of yourself.

The fact that you have thousands of people commenting, wishing you happy birthday, wishing for you to stay alive tells you that so many people, even strangers care about you. 

Your vitiligo is not an excuse for people to be terrible people. It is not your fault by any means that people would go out of their way to make someone feel so awful. Please do not blame yourself for these bad things happening to you. People can just be terrible for no reason at all. You will never win the love of everybody, and that’s not because there’s something wrong with you, it’s simply because we all have our own taste. You might absolutely love butter, but I hate it, I can’t stand it. The smell, the taste, the feeling of it, everything about it, I cannot stand it. That doesn’t mean there is something wrong with butter, we just have different tastes. (I can tell you have great taste though with Coldplay, if I lived anywhere near you bet I’d be joining you for that concert)

I’m so sorry that your friends, family and co workers couldn’t make you feel special on your birthday. I think what’s so brave about this post is that you shared your vulnerability, that doesn’t make you weak, not a terrible person, it makes you brave and it’s one step closer to getting the help you need. It’s so important to know that you don’t want to die, you just want to feel better and you can feel better you just need some help along the way.

I’m so so glad you reached out on Reddit and that it kept you alive for even one more day. I do really encourage you to reach out to friends and family and just let them know it upset you that no one said anything or celebrated with you. I think sometimes people get so swept up in their own life, work, worries that sometimes (with no malice or disregard for others) they just don’t think about these things. Everyone is ignorant to other people’s feelings until they are shared with them.

Also, more importantly, I really hope you can go and see a therapist to talk to about these feelings. You were obviously in a very vulnerable state yesterday, which is absolutely ok and there is no shame in that at all, but it could have ended very badly. Please, please, please speak to a professional. You did the right thing making the post.

We see you, we hear you, we care about you and we love you. You are important, you are worthy and you deserve good things❤️

Please be gentle with yourself and take care of yourself❤️"," Happy belated birthday! I’m sorry I didn’t get to see this on the actual day💛

If you ever find yourself in a similar situation, can you please get yourself to the Emergency department at the closest hospital? Please don't leave until you have spoken with somebody. And go into detail about what you're thinking and feeling.

If you feel like you can't do it for yourself, can you do it for all of us? Remember this day and how it has made you feel.

If you ever need to talk to somebody about anything, i am here (unless I'm unconscious because I'm asleep 😀)

When people tend to say ""everyone this"" or ""everyone that"", it tends to be a lot of gas lighting; both other people and often of oneself.  I've seen it and I've been it.  Just from a cursory glance, I was to recommend a few things and i mean this will more empathy than you will understand for years to come.

\*you're 28 now?  that's when your unresolved issues, especially with authority rears it's ugly head and tries to make you it's bitch.  IT's a very powerful event in each of our lives, some of us don't live through out ""Saturn returns"".  Look into it even if you don't subscribe to astrology/  plenty of free apps to do your chart for you and break it down.  Also look up the ""Hollywood 27 club"".  people who's Saturn returns had so much power, combined with fame, it killed them/

\*\*Stop hating yourself, you are and your depression are your own worst enemy.   If this is something that terrifies you, seek professional mental help; Wellbutrin and some psychotherapy did so much right away

\*\*\*Find your inner child and go kick it with the little mo.fo.  I'm betting he needs a new friend as much as you do.  (for me, i had to think way back about all my childhood memories and then figure out how to capture them and in a way share them with others, so i baked a pie with ingredients rom them).

\*\*\*\*choose with discretion and concern whom you allow your time to be shared with.. it is precious and so are you.  Having 100 people called friends that aren't there or you barely know or are just shit heads is nothing compared to having 1 or 2 that do.

there's many more life lessons i wish i had been given at your age.  Props for reaching out however

please call the suicide prevention hot line and ask for help.  Not a wellness check but resources so you can be equipped to stop this feeling from occurring again.  better still, so you can give this info an help to others that need it and are hurting.  much like yourself.

26450,m7s5tmx,comment,,"Hey man.

Just wanted to say that I had life hasn’t exactly been easy for me. My lowest points where I needed help was between 28 and 33. By then I had lost everything twice. Addiction issues. Bad relationships where girlfriends have cheated on me or have been abusive. I dropped out of studies and was hijacked where a gun was held to my head and I told the guy to pull the trigger.

I am 41 now and I have a wonderful wife (met when I turned 35) and have 2 beautiful kids. We go to the beach every week and I’m teaching my son how to surf. I eat healthy now. I’ve conquered my addictions and I have a stable job. I’m also 6 months out from finishing my degree and I am happy. 

It might not mean anything to you, but I hope you read this and realise that life does change as your life circumstances change and you will find happiness."," Hey man.

I'm turning 40 in April and have been going through a deep depression for the first time in my life. For context I am successful. I have beautiful wife and daughter, own a home and a business and have overcome terminal cancer. I consider myself very successful although compared to others most may not. The point I'm trying to make is that despite considering myself successful o have been in a deep depression also. It's been hard because every though I know I have it all I have been feeling incredibly worthless and devoid of value. It's a lie though. Our brain chemistry can lie to us.

Happy birthday. It really sucks that no one in your life reached out to say it but honestly with my whole heart I want you to know that I want you to have a happy birthday. People have busy lives and without constantly being reminded of you they are going to forget about things that are in their self service. I've avoided social media for some time and notice that I'm no longer relevant to certain people. It's just a harsh reality. 

I recommend you create some routine that serves you. Exercise, learning to cook something or even volunteering somewhere but make sure it serves you in some way. Self love is critical in building up your self worth. If your still really struggling then I suggest you seek out some anti depressants. They have been the only thing that has helped me recently but I must stress they have been a last resort.

Hey buddy! 

Hope you enjoy the Coldplay concert! I’m 27 and experienced/still am experiencing the same thing as you. It’s weird as guy in our mid-to-late 20’s. No one prepares us for how lonely it can get. 

I promise things can be okay. I won’t lie, it’s not easy (as you’re obviously aware) but with effort you’ll learn to love yourself more, be okay in your own company, and get yourself out there to meet new people with similar interests! 

You could have ended it all… but I bet you wouldn’t have dared go to Coldplay on your own and just speak to new people and say “Hi i’m….. no one I know likes Coldplay so i’ve come on my own…” or something along the lines of that. 

Isn’t it strange? We’re willing to die, but we’re still held by the ‘embarrassment’ of going up to new people and introducing ourselves. I got comfortable going places on my own during last summer and I met so many amazing people. It’s so freeing once you learn to get comfortable being alone.

Don’t get me wrong, you still need friends and people to spend time with, but once i’d gotten comfortable doing things solo I got more confident in myself and that turned into me going and doing more new things and meeting new people! 

Now I’ve got a new group I see regularly, i’ve got lots of people I speak to daily and see on the weekends, and i’m off to Amsterdam at the end of this month for a weekend with one of the lads I met last year.

Not sure where you live but if you’re in the UK I’d be more than happy to do something!

I’ve booked to go and Ludovico Einaudi in February on my own. A year ago I wouldn’t have even considered doing something myself and would have been so scared and embarrassed about going on my own, now I couldn’t give a toss and I genuinely love it. 

Keep going buddy, you’re worth more than you think :)

P.S - I had a moment kind of like this where I was supported by a lot of people (not to the extent yours has blown up!) But this will pass, and people will move on. I’m not saying this to be morbid, I just want you to be aware. One of the bigs things is getting used to circumstances changing. You probably feel euphoric right now, but you won’t always feel that way and have this many people reaching out…. and that is okay. 

Use this time now to forge some new friendships and get yourself the fuck out there man! We’re in our late 20’s we’re in the prime of our life!

I celebrated my 28th Birthday on the 15th of January. I was asleep and at 12:00 sharp my girlfriend called me. We are in a long distance relationship and I thought she forgot as well. 

I woke up and picked up her call. There she was holding a donut with candles in it. We celebrated on the phone and then I went to sleep.

None of my colleagues wished me or my family. I live alone and have no close friends. I left my country and am trying to build my life in another country to provide for my kids in future. 

OP you just to consider that one person can change your life. Here you have thousands who are rooting for you and love you. Don't give up on the gift of life. I usually don't pray but I will pray and hope that you are okay and healthy.

A few are still friends but only one from my 20s or earlier is still close. I changed a ton as a person, even from two years ago. Wishing you joy and friendship."," Happy Birthday!!!

Be the beacon of hope and light you want to see in the world. You hold value; start with compassion and don’t ever shortchange yourself."," Happy birthday!

I think you're doing some of that work now by giving support to a fellow human who is struggling.  Watch Near Death Experience (NDE) stories on YouTube if you haven't/don't already.  The message pretty much all of them bring back from the other side is that we're here on Earth to love and help each other.  Thank you for sharing your beautiful story, and for caring about others 🙏🏼"," Wow, people being there to grab you means you still had work to do here on Earth imo.  That was no accident.

I’m glad you reached out and feel a bit better. I hope you don’t give up. Life can get better, I promise."," Life can be really hard and lonely at times. I’ve been through it too.

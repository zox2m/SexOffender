19867,cae8a68,comment,,"This sounds great in theory but in practice it treats everyone exactly the same no matter how severe their crime or how likely to reoffend. For example, here's a quote from the NY Times.

“The sheer numbers of sex offenders on the registries in all 50 states — an estimated 674,000 across the country — are overwhelming to local police departments and, at times, to the public, who may not easily distinguish between those who must register because they have repeatedly raped children and those convicted of nonviolent or less serious crimes, like exposing themselves in public.”

And then goes on to say

“at least five states required men to register if they were caught visiting prostitutes. At least 13 required it for urinating in public (in two of which, only if a child was present). No fewer than 29 states required registration for teenagers who had consensual sex with another teenager. And 32 states registered flashers and streakers.”

Clearly, not all of these people require being tracked for life and having all their neighbors be notified when they move to the neighborhood.

The real problem is that if we can't release someone from prison with a reasonable certainty that they won't do it again, we shouldn't let them out. Then again, our prisons aren't built for rehabilitation, the are built for punishment. And punishment doesn't tend to do anything but teach people to hide their behavior better next time."," This sounds great in theory but in practice it treats everyone exactly the same no matter how severe their crime or how likely to reoffend.

""Doing what you thought was right"" is the worst fucking excuse in the book. At the risk of over-dramatizing, Hitler ""did what he thought was right"". Obviously you're not even remotely comparable to Hitler, OP, I just hope the comparison will knock some sense into you. Take responsibility for your own actions, don't blame others for your shortcomings.

If you are going into criminal forensics, you will have a great affect on people's LIVES. These are PEOPLE, not fucking anonymous bits online. This isn't the internet any more, and you can't act like you're 13, which is exactly what you just did. From what you wrote, you didn't do what you did for the kiddies (it's not like you were molested yourself, and seeing this man triggered an uncontrollable response in you to hurt him), you did it for your ego. This is so fucking unacceptable.

Imagine if lawyers, judges, or reporters acted like you. Look at how (rightly) upset reddit gets when they do. It doesn't matter that he was a sex offender, not an innocent, it doesn't matter that there was some preliminary evidence against him. You ignored any ethical and moral obligation you had, you ignored the rules and standards of your chosen profession which are there precisely for situations like this, you didn't put the work or effort, and you didn't think about the consequences in the slightest. Frankly, I don't know you or know much about you, but even with your username, you come across as a slightly sheltered, immature person, who may be more used to interacting online than in real life. Who know's maybe you're nothing like that.

Now, I've been quite harsh with you, because I feel you need to be shocked into reality a bit. You really need to understand the gravity of this situation and accept responsibility for your own actions. However, you do seem very aware that what you did is wrong, and quite genuine in your desire not to let it repeat. I don't think you are a bad person, you simply seem immature, and that's ok. You can learn, you'll become more mature. So learn from this experience. Every time you are confronted with a similar situation, remember that its easy to make a snap judgement. Your job is to do due diligence, make sure you know ALL the facts, and if you must judge, to do so impartially, not so you can stroke your dick. Lawyers generally get some training and classes along these lines, precisely because they will have positions with such power. It's unfortunate that you didn't, but on the other hand, this one experience I think will be worth more than 100 such classes.

We've all made mistakes, I certainly have. Perhaps I've simply been luckier than you in that mine haven't affected anyone's life yet. You're immature. That can change. I think there's a really good chance this is the kick in the gut you need, and if you truly accept this as a learning experience, you can use this to become a much better person and forensic science major. Everyone else seems to be commentating that yes, you didn't do a great job, but you can move past it. Do not listen to this idiot who tells you to not blame yourself. I fucking disagree. Don't 'move past' this, I hope that 20 years down the line you still remember this incident, and that it still brings about a slight tinge of shame to your cheeks. That's good.

19875,cae9ftm,comment,,"As I said, I agree with the concept, not necessarily how it is currently executed. I'm referring specifically to very serious crimes such as rape, child molestation and sexual assault (as well as crimes that aren't sexual offences such as murder etc); crimes that are violent and have a severe damaging impact on the victim. Putting someone on a permanent sex offender registry for pissing on the street is just silly to me.

I do think that a certain amount of punishment is necessary in any justice system; the problem though is that instead of viewing the justice system as a means of protecting citizens, a lot of people seem to view it as a means of enacting revenge on the criminal, and so the punishment aspect is overemphasised. IMO the most efficient way of protecting citizens from a dangerous criminal is to remove the latter from society for a given length of time (depending on the severity of their crime), attempt to rehabilitate them (as most criminals have reasons for commiting their crimes, and rehabilitation might help them change their circumstances outside of prison so they don't feel compelled towards illegal activity), and keep tabs on them in some way (again, depending on the severity of the crime) to prevent a reoffence. You may say that if the first two steps are successful then there shouldn't be a need for the third, but the reality is that that won't always be the case no matter how long you lock someone up for."," As I said, I agree with the concept, not necessarily how it is currently executed.

Yes and that is extremely unfortunate. I feel sorry for the person. But the last charge was over 20 years ago.

Which he's still doing voluntarily (hopefully since OP decided to take it upon himself to handle a delicate situation.)

These guys aren't coming back with a clean slate. their being tracked all the time and trying to fix themselves and get over their past. If you can't find it in your heart to forgive someone who truly wants redemption, then get out of life, you're a stain on human progress.

If you feel so strongly about killing pedophiles, go grab a gun or knife, look up your local sex offenders, and go for it! You'll be judged by a jury of your peers and you'll go to jail for killing a man you barely knew. either way, have fun!

I'm sorry this happened to you. 

I think you need to implement some strategies in the future if this affects you badly. 

Like, if you want something serious or at least ongoing, you have to abstain from engaging sexually for however long it takes for them to show you who they are and what they want, not who they say they are and want, dudes will say anything to nut, by being a little bit prude and playing the long game at least some bad fruit will weed itself out. 

And, we're not talking a couple of dates here, but rather at least four weeks but preferably several months or even longer. The more it matters to you what they want, the stronger you should protect this boundary. Find someone who likes you and wants to know you puts effort into that continuously for a long time before considering sleeping with them. 

But even then this might happen, some men are intrigued by it and go for the long con. But most just give up and move on to something easier, so it's still more safe.

I was given the wrong medication once, and I was completely overtaken with ecstasy, and I felt invincible day in and day out for a very very long time (as happens in bipolar mania). My whole life a big rule I had was to always be kind to others, but when I was manic, I felt so good about myself, that it seemed that everyone else would be able to do that too. It seemed impossible that anyone could be hurt by me, because nothing could bring me down. Plus I was so out of control and just overtaken by the feeling. My personality changed, and I made mean jokes frequently, and one day I found out that people were really impacted by them. I was also insulted, as if I was incredibly cruel and terrible, and I totally felt that to my core, because in reality I was totally empathetic, I just lost all of my morals in the thrill of it all. The thing about bipolar is that what goes up must come down, and I when I came down, it was really extreme. I believed I was going to hell no matter what I did, and there was nothing I could ever do to fix it. I’d also done things on my school laptop, which I felt I could never erase. I at one point delusionally believed I had committed a crime, and I kept that secret for so long, and it hurt harder than anything, because I felt there was nothing I could do to hide it, and my guilt was giving it all away.

Yes, I had a secret, but I couldn’t keep it.
The shame was clear, I had something to hide.
They’d ask me “Are you okay? Are you alright?”
But afraid I was too ashamed, I wouldn’t ever reply.
My energy was drained from keeping it inside.

Medication and therapy definitely really helps with these things, but it can take a long time.

Guns do kill nobody will ever say they don't, but guns are also used to shoot targets made of paper, cardboard, plastic, metal, etc. You can also use guns to make negative molds that you fill with plastic for training purposes.

Been with that person for the past 7 years.

In fact I don't see any difference between coke and crack. It's the exact same substance in a different form. One of you snorts the other smokes it. Y'all ain't lesser for it..

I've never had much trouble avoiding drugs long term except for opioids. And I've had to stay away for almost 9 years. Funny enough, my partner of 12 years liked me more while I was using than afterwards...

The reality is that trauma bonds exist. You've bonded over trauma, youve likely both suffered trauma. People don't become crack or cocaine addicts for fun..

You likely both had similar experiences in the past. 

Trust me - meth is a whole other ballgame but crack and cocaine can both be used heavily. The issue is that coke plugs your nose so you gotta take a break eventually. 

Unless you mess up the crack won't burn your lungs. 

Honestly ... I think you are gonna get ZERO useful replies on this subreddit no offense to anyone here. It's just y'all aren't used to drug users.

Calling a crack addict a loser based on his actions - sure. People can be losers independently of their drug use. But many responses attempting to comfort op are gonna just make her feel bad because they focus on him being a loser because he's a crack addict. Or they blame his horrible behavior on the drugs.

No... I've used drugs that made friends do bad shit. I didn't do those things. But alcohol for example made me the worst version of myself. I did things drunk I'd never do sober...

There is probably a lot more nuance to the situation than you've posted. If you wanna chat it up, send me a message. Otherwise just keep yourself safe and focus on your mental health and your addiction issues simultaneously."," The thing is, even normal people use cocaine and meth and crack.

20161,m8095kd,comment,,"I am Southeast Asian and I also had an open, honest relationship with my parents growing up and in my young adulthood. (I still do, but I only meant to emphasize the time period.)

While I am not entirely sure what you want to be met with in the comments, I will put out a slightly different one from what others have already written.

When I moved to Europe later on in my adulthood, still young but older than you are now and not middle aged, I felt very often torn between Western logic that my head had been formed in and the values my Asian heart had been brought up in. While I understood on a logical level what fellow young people from the U.S., U.K., and rest of Europe would express as their opinions on things, I felt lonely in wanting someone to just acknowledge that my Asian heart was NOT an illogical, unreasonable, stupid character for not embracing the same kind of spirit. It troubled me that my Western counterparts might see me as un-free: confined to certain traditional notions that were perhaps to them constricting and illogical. I had always been seen as an intellectual, and therefore valuable in academic circles and my career. But now being in a different culture -- neither better nor worse -- I felt that my Asian values threatened my self-image as a reasonable, valuable intellectual.

All I had wanted though, I think, was for someone to acknowledge that there was nothing wrong in wishing to be considerate about my parents as well as myself as well as those I related to. Instead, I felt like I had to deny one half of me as stupid and childish in order to feel respected and mature and modern.

I've since learned that... there wasn't anything wrong with me or my heart. I loved my parents. I wanted to be loving towards them by being honest. I loved people I spent time with and wanted to make things fair for them. And there is a way of handling things that means that just because I am considering these competing interests instead of just point-blank favoring my own comfort doesn't mean I am an immature people pleaser.

What others have said here about you being an adult at 23 and to think nothing about your parents' thoughts is not necessarily wrong nor right. These come from a particular cultural perspective that may feel more right or wrong, depending on where one happens to be coming from, and not just geographically.

So, I don't know if this is what you are looking for, as I have no advice, but if you are feeling the way I might have been several years ago, to you I kindly say: your heart is trying to be kind and loving to all the people it has loved. And that is a beautiful thing. And this doesn't necessarily mean that this kind of impulse is bad because it comes at the expense of yourself. But it is something that you will learn to navigate in time.

May your mind and heart find their peace."," I am Southeast Asian and I also had an open, honest relationship with my parents growing up and in my young adulthood. (I still do, but I only meant to emphasize the time period.)

I feel your pain and your despair, but know that you are not alone. Life, even in its darkest moments, is a precious gift, and each trial we go through hides a wisdom that we do not always immediately perceive.

The Quran is an inexhaustible source of light and comfort. It is addressed to wounded hearts, to souls in search of peace, and reminds us that every difficulty is followed by ease. 
“And exalted to you your fame? Alongside the difficulty is, of course, an ease! Alongside the difficulty is, of course, an ease! (Surah 94: Ach-Sharh, verses 5-6).

I invite you to read and meditate on the verses of the Quran, to seek their wisdom and to find comfort in the divine Word. God knows what you are going through and will never abandon you. “Do not despair of Allah’s mercy.
” Say: “O My servants who have committed excesses to your own detriment, do not despair of the mercy of Allah. Because Allah forgives all sins. Yes, He is the Forgiving, the Most Merciful.”
(Surah 39: Az-Zoumar, verse 53).

I also encourage you to visit this site: (www.ahl-alquran.com) where you can deepen the interpretation of the verses and perhaps find an answer to your suffering. If you feel the need to talk, don't hesitate to reach out to someone you trust.

You are important, and your presence on this earth has meaning. Be patient with yourself, take care of your soul and let the light of the Quran soothe you.

With all my kindness,"," A message of hope and light

1. Apply for SNAP benefits to get your food needs met: https://www.in.gov/fssa/dfr/snap-food-assistance/do-i-qualify-for-snap/

2. Assuming your job doesn’t pay enough, go to https://www.in.gov/fssa/dfr/impact-job-training/ and see if you can get job training and help through IMPACT 

3. Free healthcare if you qualify: https://www.in.gov/fssa/hip/

And in the meantime, a cheap and relatively filling food source you could get in bulk is oatmeal.. I ate a lot of that when I barely had money (and I don’t like oatmeal, but it helped me survive).

Then for longterm, I’d start looking at State jobs. If you don’t have a degree, there are always ones that don’t require that and provide a great way to get in the door with opportunity to move up, plus you’ll get great benefits.

20315,m7zg6sm,comment,,"I know someone who smelled like onions too. No matter what. She bathed at least once a day, and immediately, onions. She is petite. She started having stomach pains that resulted in a slew of doctors, tests, meds and research. 

The smell was embarassing to her, but more of a nuisance compared to the GI issues. Those were dibilitating. After and ungodly amount of research, we found something. 

She has a few cats, and there is a thing called Pork-Cat Syndrome. Basically, as my leyman understanding has it, the protein in Pork and the protein you're exposed to when you have cats, create an allergic reaction. She's not allergic to cats, she's not allergic to pork. But if she's around cats and eats pork, she's doubled over in pain. And smells like onions.

She eliminated pork from her diet. No more pain. No more onion smell. It was actually amazing how drastic it was. No drugs. No surgery. No botox. No doctors ever figured it out. Not even the allergist, who dismissed the theory altogether and said it's so rare it couldn't be that. But one small change to her diet resolved it. And it's easy with dietary options, anything halal or kosher is automatically ok to eat. 

She did have an issue with her skin with keratosis pilaris on her shoulders and back and butt. Again, a nuisance. Look like little pimples, but never went away. Not nearly as big of a deal as being doubled over in pain all of the time or smelling like onions. But kind of annoying when you're an 11 and it's swimsuit season and you live near the beach. 

Recently found the fix for that. Tallow soap. Bought it on a whim, but it cleared up noticably in about a week. And it smells really good. Now, no pain, no smell, no bumps."," I know someone who smelled like onions too. No matter what. She bathed at least once a day, and immediately, onions. She is petite.

She's not allergic to cats, she's not allergic to pork. But if she's around cats and eats pork, she's doubled over in pain. And smells like onions.

She eliminated pork from her diet. No more pain. No more onion smell. It was actually amazing how drastic it was. No drugs. No surgery. No botox. No doctors ever figured it out. Not even the allergist, who dismissed the theory altogether and said it's so rare it couldn't be that. But one small change to her diet resolved it. And it's easy with dietary options, anything halal or kosher is automatically ok to eat. 

She did have an issue with her skin with keratosis pilaris on her shoulders and back and butt. Again, a nuisance. Look like little pimples, but never went away. Not nearly as big of a deal as being doubled over in pain all of the time or smelling like onions. But kind of annoying when you're an 11 and it's swimsuit season and you live near the beach. 

Recently found the fix for that. Tallow soap. Bought it on a whim, but it cleared up noticably in about a week. And it smells really good. Now, no pain, no smell, no bumps.",2,,2025-01-19 14:28:01,t3_1i49di1,,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1i49di1/no_more_onion_groin_or_armpit_smell_antibacterial/m7zg6sm/,Neutral

This is why many surgeons (at least in my country) don't use antiseptic after surgery, because it can be harmful on the long term and cause infections you can kill with antiseptics or antibiotics.

20376,m7x4isp,comment,,"Hi! I’m a molecular biologist and would caution against using any sort of antibacterial based medication on a daily basis for an extended period of time (over a week). There are a couple of reasons behind this. 1) you have healthy bacteria living on your skin that NEED to exist to help keep your body healthy. This would be like taking an oral antibiotic every day to have fresher breath, you’d risk killing off your healthy gut flora for a limited benefit. 2) bacteria reproduce incredibly quickly and because of this, they are able to mutate and adapt to survive. This means that while this solution may work for you now, the chances of this working for months on end is very limited. 3) because the bacteria can adapt to resist the antibiotics present in this spray, if you do end up with a skin infection in the future for any reason, you are more likely to have a difficult time treating it

However, with that said, I empathize DEEPLY. I am also a very sweaty woman and that sweat can be PUNGENT by the end of the day. I consistently swap out my antiperspirant brand to keep my chances of it working a bit higher. I would also highly recommend Lume! It’s quite literally made for pits and groins, and works because it changes the pH of your skin. The good bacteria are able to survive is this slightly more acidic environment while the bad bacteria aren’t!

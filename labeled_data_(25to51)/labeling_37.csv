After dating men I felt like I was actually cared for even if I took the more masculine role in the relationship.

I havent once said that men are entitled to sex or have ‘earned the right’ from women due to gifts. I simply stated that it isnt defined as entitled.

Same thing on the receiving end. People should not be bending over backward to please someone just because they find them attractive.

Had my first smoke at 17. My home life was... not great. I was hooked.

On and off until I was 22 I smoked. Quit at 23 when I got married/bought a house. It was Illegal then, so I had good cause to quit. Sober for 3 years, but with a new kid, Covid, and life, I started drinking very heavily.

So quit the booze for good at 26, and hit the weed for the ole California recovery program lol...

Smoke 1.5-2.5oz a month depending on how I burned. Started at night only, to then when kids were napping too, to sneaking downstairs before anyone got up to get a hit and start the day ""buzzing""

I need to quit, it's controlling my life... Imagine saying you don't want to play ball with your kid because you're sober and down, with no energy or appetite. You know it, the THC is like caffeine. Body grows a need for the brain to feel like it's at full throttle. The truth is weed's full throttle is really sober 1/4 throttle for me.

My 5yo deserves better, my Wife deserves better. Hell everone in my life does.


 I reduced my usage down to only at night, and only twice per night.

Next week will be down to once per night. Then the week after only on the weekends, up to twice. The next week, weekend but once.

Then I plan to go to one day a week, then quit.

Every other time I've quit I've done it cold turkey and the high levels of THC I had built up just murdered me. So this time is different. We are adults, and if I want to try to quit with as little discomfort as possible so be it. 


Oh, I also stopped buying the highest THC strains and started taking CBD oil. Hope it helps me."," Hey, I'm 30, going on 31 myself. Have a House, some cars, a business, Wife, kids, dog, cat, hobbies, etc. Say this to relate not boast as you sound successful in your usage.

21702,m6xr6s4,comment,,"Coming from someone who was an everyday stoner for 6 years, trust me, it’s a mental addiction.

I broke away after having having small epiphanies and insightful moments that made me realize I don’t want to smoke. Every. Single. Day. The repetition of the “ritual” really turned me away from. At the time I was very athletic and I couldn’t give up sports/wellness for smoking so that was one of my biggest motivations.

I’m not trying to shame you, or anyone at all. I just think you got a find the reason.

Tbh, I have friends who still smoke ritually and they’re successful, happy people who have their lives together. The difference between them now versus when we were in our 20’s is that they don’t smoke every other hour. Instead, it’s in moderation and at some point during the day. It doesn’t take the forefront of their day. Instead, they view it as a treat.

The only thing stopping you from reaching your goal is yourself. Sounds cheesey, but it's true. If you really desire to make the change, you will, no matter what it takes.

It may be daunting, and you may need help, but understand that everything you are feeling while trying to be less dependant on weed is normal. You will have cravings, you will be anxious, and you might feel like you can't handle some of your emotions. This is also completely normal. The way i imagined it when I quit was that when I started using, my teenage self had ""water spouts"" for each of my emotions, and when I would use the substance, my brain would close those spouts from a full stream to a slow trickle. The anger, anxiety, and sadness that I felt at the time all felt a lot more manageable in that state. When I quit, I had to learn how to run with all spouts open, all the time, all over again. It was hard, yes, but what you don't realize is that you were also ""closing"" the better emotional spouts, like happiness, relief, and self confidence.

Now, you need to slowly cut back. Start with stopping the weed AT WORK. Bake in the morning, but then no more until you get home.  Do that for a few weeks. Then, replace the evening smoke with a workout, hike, walk, whatever. When you get home, immediately change and go exercise.

I recommend finding a local (or online) SMART Recovery meeting. It's very nonjudgmental and it's more about group therapy and learning to understand yourself and your mind rather than white-knuckling through sobriety.


If you aren't up for that yet, I would suggest reading about stoicism. I was hooked by Meditations, by Marcus Aurelius. But I know that stuff can be difficult for some folks to enjoy, so The Stoic Challenge is a very accessible book that reads like a manual to the mind.


Feel free to DM if you want to talk more about this stuff. It's a difficult decision to make, but it does get easier over time and you do eventually relearn how to live your life without it again. "," It takes time to rewrite the parts of your brain that your DoC wired itself into.

When you find yourself homeless as a teenager with no familial support system, you do what you have to in order to survive. 


I dated a girl in college who worked nights at a group home for older foster kids who weren't currently fostered (or something like that). On our nights out on the town, she was constantly coming across her residents drinking, doing drugs, and prostituting in the alleys and in the streets around the bars. It was a real problem. "," Nah.

22066,m6ucl6s,comment,,"I had a “friend” from college do the same exact thing. He then tried to donate to the domestic abuse shelter in my area to make up for it. 

These people are so insecure and sick. I try not to think about what happened, but to examine what may have led up to it and what was going on in his head.

I noticed that he hadn’t ever really been that good of a friend to me. We’d laugh together, vent our frustrations about the world, analyze life, and talk about our current partners. Then, he would say something incredibly obtuse and weird, like I smelled like sausage, or my skin kept changing textures, or bombard me with how he absolutely had to get a law degree along with becoming a doctor so that no one could take advantage of him. He would sometimes give me weird nicknames and clung to me emotionally, although initially I thought I was just being a pal.


About five years after college ended and he had kept me company over zoom while I made a difficult transition due to my mental health, I went to visit him. He had just broken up with his girlfriend. I got in, it seemed fine, and then he started talking about how he had been having sex with someone new and that the sex, which he described in detail, was very very kinky, almost grotesque in that you might need to go to the hospital if you were on the receiving end.

I tried to put it out of my mind, since we had talked about sex before, just not like. 

I guess I just knew he wanted to have sex with me, and so a few hours later, after we came back from dinner and a few drinks, he asked if he could just see what it was like to kiss me. I said sure, and then before I knew it he had me on the bed, pulled off my clothes, inserted himself for about two minutes, came, and then left the room. I was stunned. I pretended it wasn’t that bad, left the next day, and we have never spoken again. That was 10 years ago. Right after I got home, he said he was making the donation, and I blocked him.

This then happened to me with yet another friend, very similar, but in a hotel. He was also very needy like this guy was, and I had confused his neediness for genuine friendship. That was 8 years ago.

I basically withdrew from sex, a few years after that assault, because it kept happening from different angles. I’ve been abstinent for 7 years now. I don’t know when I’ll be back. One day, after I’m done healing. I can kind of feel it. 

I’ve become less picky, and more open and receptive to what the world might bring me. These other people, well I had set up some self sabotaging criteria for the right kind of a guy, and didn’t realize it until I took a step back and left the dating world."," I had a “friend” from college do the same exact thing.

Testimony is evidence, people always forget that. 

If she went to the police and told them exactly what she posted here they would have probable cause for an arrest.

Idk if the cops she soaks to are SVU focused maybe, they will almost certainly do an interview of all parties. 

Will the process end in a conviction, probably not. Typically jury's want more than just testimony, but that depends on how credible each side comes off.

Is it worth it to press charges, depends on what type of resolution she is looking for. Dealing with the police is an invasive and embarrassing process, even more so if it goes to trial, and you may very well lose.

But it may make the perpetrator think long and hard about his actions and course correct before he hurts someone else or doessomething worse. So it might still be with it. 

Might be best to just cut the guy off and move on.

I'm asking these questions because I encourage women to be firm and get physical if need be to avoid something worse happening to them. God forbid she was ever in a situation like this again, standing your ground is a much better than saying no and hoping a fucking moron like this just stops. Women aren't just little delicate objects. They can and should defend themselves.. physically if need be.

22080,m6vqa43,comment,,"First of all, I apologize to you. I wasn’t trying to hurt or offend or call your actions into question. You’re brave and you DO have a strong spirit and even if I didn’t agree with something you said it doesn’t change those facts. Also, let me just clarify that what I meant was awful was the notion of letting things boil up inside because I’ve tried that for many years and it never works out well, those feelings have to come out. I didn’t mean you have to get therapy or go to the police because I personally would not do either one of those things, just my personal feelings on it. I no longer bottle things up but instead I close and lock all the doors and windows and I crank my guitar amplifier so loud that you can hear it down the block, pictures and stuff rattling on the walls and things falling off countertops upstairs. 🤣🤣🤣 I hope you have some type of outlet, whatever that may be, to help you cope and release those negative feelings and thoughts because you’re innocent. I let it boil and it led to years of drug use and I felt like I was stronger but really I’d just turned my feelings off to the rest of the world.

22081,m6uhgo7,comment,,"I get that you should evaluate risk and try to not put yourself in overly dangerous situations because it’s not a perfect world, but this situation is done so why victim blame? Plus it was a friend she had known for years though. It should have been safer than kissing a date you’ve only known for a few months. Kissing someone you have know for years shouldn’t be putting yourself in any type of situation or risk unless you are saying men can’t control themselves or only kiss and it’s the woman’s fault. She said NO. So who she was kissing was irrelevant whether it was a boyfriend or friend or stranger. What if she didn’t kiss him and he still did that because if he was willing to not stop after no who knows if he even cared whether she wanted to kiss or not? Was she not supposed to ever be alone with a friend?"," I get that you should evaluate risk and try to not put yourself in overly dangerous situations because it’s not a perfect world, but this situation is done so why victim blame?

22084,m6twqyc,comment,,"He fingered her. He did not take her virginity. And much more likely scratched her with fingernails. Abrasions are very common in cases of assault especially when someone is trying to get away. Not everyone bleeds when they “lose their virginity,” which is caused by the hymen stretching and tearing. A finger isn’t stretching much of anything. Less than 50% of women bleed due to “cherry popping.” Regardless, virginity is more of a construct than something physical like the tissue stretching, which can be caused by other things than sex, sure."," He fingered her.

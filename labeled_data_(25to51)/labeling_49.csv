28206,m8bak3q,comment,,As someone who's started over 4 times. Life is never truly easy. But you as a person can change your scenery every single time. Do not be scared to start over. Don't be afraid to make a move. Once you do everything comes into place. And you'll always have that sigh of relief along with shit that wasn't that bad lol. It happens all the time. Ruts never stop. You have to be strong be confident if you think you can do something do it. If you think you have an ability take advantage of it. Meeting people and doing things is easy as a simple hi. And you can form then best of friendships with that. And everything else comes with it. You're only 19 and have your whole adult life ahead of you and there's people in their 40s with these same issues. You're not alone. Step outside of your comfort zone and I guarantee you it creates a high you never felt before then you gain confidence and bam. Just remember to be yourself. Be true to yourself and always protect your boundaries and personal preferences. I wish you all the best you can do it., As someone who's started over 4 times. Life is never truly easy.

28207,m8banfc,comment,,"Being 19 the world looks and feels so different than it will in a few years. (I’m 29 and when I was 19 I struggled with lots of the same feelings that you are currently going through as well as a very messy breakup with my high school sweetheart who I thought I was going to marry). Right now you are going through a lot of pain but suicide is a permanent solution for a temporary problem.  Please consider trying to reach out to your friends or family. If they still are not there for you then fuck them. You can and will find better people to surround yourself with. What you need to do is try to focus on self love. Maybe set some goals for yourself to work towards to try and help fix you mental health. Start going for walks outside, try to get into exercising, try some new hobbies like painting. Just try to focus on becoming the best you, you can be. It will be hard but literally 1-2 months from now you could feel completely different about all of this. Especially if you start taking steps to change your environment. Remember you still are really young and your brain isn’t done developing until you hit 25. So how you feel right now is not how you will feel in the future. You wont even feel like the same person. I lost a friend to suicide in college and I’m sure they felt a similar way to how you feel right now. But we didn’t know. We were young and all missed the signs. If they could have only seen how their death impacted all of their friends and acquaintances there is no way they would have felt so alone. So many people loved them and mourned them. Remember we are our own worst enemies and it is important to cut yourself a break. We always make things worse in our heads than they are in real life. And also remember you just lost someone you clearly loved. A week isn’t long enough to recover from that. Please don’t consider such a permanent solution. At the very least give yourself some time to heal and try to be kind to yourself. We only live once, when we die that’s probably it, and you have no idea the amazing life you could be missing out on if you decide to check out early. Don’t just stay alive for the ones around you. Do it for you because you deserve a chance to be happy. You have no idea what your future holds and who you will meet."," Being 19 the world looks and feels so different than it will in a few years.

28211,m8bax31,comment,,"19 is too young to call it quits. Honestly, I’ve been where you are. I decided to change everything around me. Job, friends, etc. I found someone I could talk to. I told myself if after making all those changes I still felt that way in a year then I could end it knowing I tried everything.

Death  is a permanent solution to what maybe a temporary roadblock. It wasn’t easy and some days it creeps back into my mind. But, I found comfort in experiencing that there were so many people that were going through the same situation.  Some had it so much worse than me yet they found comfort in reaching out to people who felt so lost and alone. 
I get it now. I’m reaching out to you so say you aren’t the only one you are not alone. If you give yourself a chance to see things from a different perspective it will help you understand why you feel this way.
You aren’t a burden on family friends or society. You have value, you just haven’t figured it what it is yet. You owe it to yourself to find out what it is. You’re only 19! You are being too hard on yourself.  Feel free to DM me. I’m not a professional I may not have all the answers, but I do care.

28218,1i6de2n,post,If only I had a chance to show you what all is missed. ,"Everything. Literally everyfuckingthing reminds me of you. It’s bitter sweet to say the least. I’d assume you don’t feel anything towards me anymore and I’m thankful you’re not suffering but I’m not there. Im beginning to doubt I ever will be. I don’t settle and you can never be replaced. 
You see, my heart is even more stubborn than my brain. It won’t let you go. There is no discussion to be held, It won’t move on and it won’t forget you. No matter what scenario my mind plays out. My heart won’t stand to be out reasoned on concerns of you. 
So I accept this new state I live in. This reality. This life. The one where I no longer crave drugs to numb. I no longer search for lust or have eyes for strange women to forget. Now I search for peace, wholeness, I look for calm…. . . For my heart and head to be reunited. I keep things bright for the most part but that facade is scared. What a helpless feeling. The depth of this wound is likely to my core. My heart cries for you. It’s one I never anticipated.  Fatal, I would almost choose to be back where I was before we met. Naturally my heart screams out in rebuttal at the thought of not knowing you but at least I was strong enough to over come those things(my mind)…. With your help(my heart). 
I know I’m intelligent, but there is no way I’ll outwit my heart when it’s involving you. I can’t talk it off of this ledge. I can’t stop the ache that comes from its mourning the loss of you.  Ironic yet poetic... My ultimate destruction.. the thing that completed me. it seems as though my journey isn’t over, just the search for my other half. . . 
The one thing agreed on:
Where ever you are and whatever you do, you always have someone rooting for you. Praying nothing but the greatest and best of things for you.

When you do, put on your favourite soft pajamas, wash your face real well,  crawl into your warm and cozy bed, and congratulate yourself. You did it- you made it until the end of the day. Now reward yourself with a nice long sleep in that warm and cozy bed. Tell yourself how proud you should be for making it through another day. You won. You made it through.

And when you wake up tomorrow morning, remind yourself again- I just have to make it until the end of the day.

28247,m8be0zi,comment,,"First of all, happy belated birthday, OP! I know right now things may feel really tough, and I can only imagine how isolated you must feel in these moments. But please know that you are not alone, and you are absolutely not a terrible person. Life can be really overwhelming, especially when it feels like people around us don’t appreciate or understand us the way we wish they would. But your value is not defined by the calls or messages you get, or by how others may treat you. You are incredible just as you are, and the people who truly care for you see that, even if it doesn’t always feel that way. Life is not just about feeling happiness, it's about feeling many emotions and sensation. That's what makes you a human. Being vulnerable doesn't make you any less strong.

I hope you can see that your worth is not tied to your appearance, your success, or how others treat you. You matter, not just because of what you give to others, but because of who you are at your core and what your beliefs are. Your kindness, your empathy, and your willingness to care are things that make you special, even if they don’t always feel recognized or rewarded.

Please don’t let these hard moments make you believe that life is only about the struggles. You are so much more than the challenges you're facing right now. Your future holds so many possibilities, and though it may not seem like it, your story is far from over. The only thing that will be ending is your sadness, OP! Please always feel free to DM me if you ever feel like talking to someone. I will always be there for you and please know that i love youuu a lot lot lot.

We all encounter these moments. Right now I feel lonely and I’m watching a show alone and I wish I had someone still to share these times and moments with, but I don’t currently and I’ve had to analyze why and what I am feeling. 

One cause is the conditioning we’ve experienced in these past years from social media and being online of the expectations we have for our day to day lives and the addiction we have to dopamine and constant validation and entertainment.  When we put a game down or put our phones down, we expect to be constantly engaged, constantly validated, constantly entertained or have someone there. 

I myself have to remind myself of the cause and therapy at times is learning the algebra to why you feel the way you do. 

If you need someone to talk to more, shoot a DM, don’t give up - life goes on and this too shall pass. It’s one of the hardest things you’ll ever do, but grin and bearing it and white knuckling it through these feelings I promise will be worth it."," You can’t let moments of boredom tarnish what is a promising and exciting life.

Feel it as much as you can in the meantime. Feeling the pain is part of grieving.

I want you to know that IM proud of you. I'm proud of of for giving yourself this voice, this opportunity to be heard. I'm proud of you for acknowledging your insecurities and being willing to take that accountability. I'm proud of you for being as honest as you've been able to here today.

I've been through my fair share of not wanting wanting be alive and right now I'm so glad that I had realized that there was a part of me that wanted to live.

I believe in you.

I truly believe in you.

I wish I had more of the immediate pieces 

AND, I 100% believe in you to move through this pain.

I have in my pillowcase a letter I wrote last time I remember bawling my eyes out for hours and hours, I was in a room full of people at a spiritual retreat hoping to find answers and help. Instead I found my deep long lost pains coming back to me.

on the letter i wrote the things things wanted, even things I don't understand about or have little faith in. 

The idea of friends from your post would be an example of what could be in your letter. For me there is the question of spirituality and a longing to one day have a relationship with spirituality that brings purpose in my life. I wrote that from a place of not having faith per say. Or strongly challenging any idea of faith.

that note is in my pillowcase I decided I'm going to leave it in there and one day I will read it and realize I have all of those things.

it happened to me once before but it was in a journal entry. Months later I had everything I had longed for after 30 + years on this planet having been lost in all the areas.

I did find myself lost again more recently and remembered that journal entry thst came true which gave me the idea of the letter in my pillowcase. 

it was in November. I was bawling screaming ""I don't want to be alive anymore""
 

I can tell you that I do now. Life is still scary especially when I first wake up. Many of the things have been coming true for me including a spiritual practice that makes sense for me.

very much about living and behaving following a standard of love.

I know this is a long post and probably not as helpful as I hope but I do hope there's a tidbit of something you can take from this."," I realize it's not just the break up - but about the break up - look it's going to HURT LIKE HELL, like it does now - real bad - but IT WILL get better.

 I struggle with some of the same issues and have been in therapy for years. I think I was around 30 when I started going because at 29(I turn 44 in May) I started having health issues no one could explain and eventually lost everything. It's been up and down ever since. I've got fur babies now plus grand-furbabies and a couple of furmoms that depend on me to take care of their babies when out of town. Maybe you could look into doing something like that or volunteer at a shelter. Surround yourself with love. Remember your words have power so focus on positive thoughts. If you don't say it your babies don't say it to yourself. 
If in person therapy isn't an option at the moment, maybe you can look for some books or videos. When there's times I can't make it to my therapist there's always loads of resources online that help. There are some really great therapists that share wonderful resources & tips on their social media. If you're not familiar with your local library, most offer free apps for ebooks and free videos, like hoopla & Libby. Some have educational resources that might help. I can't think of what it's called but it's like Netflix but documentaries & educational videos. Might have some that focus on personal growth. 
The past couple years have been rough and having my therapist and a wonderful nurse practitioner has made all the difference. Finding the right people to help you along the way so you can find the resources you will need makes a big difference. 
This next part comes from non medical personnel and this is not medical advice. If you happen to seek medical advice, which if you can I highly recommend it, and medication is discussed, I would recommend checking to see if the office does GeneSight testing. You can google it and find out more about the testing & if it's offered in your area. It made a huge difference for me. I had gone years trying different things and doctors not believing me when I said the meds were not working.  The test will show meds that will likely work with your body and those that won't. I am not pushing meds, meds are not the answer for everyone, but if you look at that option I just wanted you to know about that as a resource. It helps a lot of people so they are not having to go through a bunch of trial and error.

Suicide is a whole other thing.  No death can compare to this nightmare. First of all suicidal people can be easy to spot and easy to help. They make several ""attempts"" and bring up the subject. But people who kill themselves are quite different. They don't make attempts or talk about it or display any signs of their plan for fear if someone found out they might succeed in stopping them. It's an effective strategy for them but for the people who have to find out the news it is a feeling like you've never known before.

I was at work with everyone gathered around for the nightly meeting when they told us  ""We have some not so great news. Our friend Malcom took his own life last night."" 

You could here some gasps and sighs as people slowly and silently went to work. But not me. I was frozen. I forgot how to walk. I forgot how to breathe. Even if I could move I didn't know where to move to. Even though I've been in this building surrounded by these people for 6 years I couldn't identify anything familiar around me. I told myself, ""Dude you have to start taking a step"" cuz once people were familiar again they started noticing I hadn't moved and I knew they would try to talk to me. and i couldn't form words the rest of the night. the best I could do was, "" i, you , tha, for..:"" I couldn't do my job so I stood out of the way by some equipment and looked up and stayed that way til my shift was over. i got in my car and cried for 7 years now.

It is beyond heartbreaking. It takes your loved ones and turns them into different people who are sad and are never the same. Their thoughts are all dark and hopeless. I know that you don't understand the impact but it is huge. It is not a cool thing to do.

Other things to consider are not all attempts are successful. You could F yourself up real good and have to live forever like that.

And there is the possibility you may spend eternity suffering in hell. no one knows for sure but definitely no worth the chance.

And life is cool. rarely are things as good or as bad as the seem.

You will have many many more boyfriends. loneliness comes and goes but things always get better.

When you feel this way go find some old people and spend time with them, play a board game or help them with something or just sit and talk with them. This is one thing I guarantee will take your mind off things and make you feel great. it will cure almost everything on your list that sucks."," I'm guessing you never had to experience what happens when someone close to you takes their own life.

Suicide is a whole other thing.  No death can compare to this nightmare. First of all suicidal people can be easy to spot and easy to help. They make several ""attempts"" and bring up the subject. But people who kill themselves are quite different. They don't make attempts or talk about it or display any signs of their plan for fear if someone found out they might succeed in stopping them. It's an effective strategy for them but for the people who have to find out the news it is a feeling like you've never known before.

I was at work with everyone gathered around for the nightly meeting when they told us  ""We have some not so great news. Our friend Malcom took his own life last night."" 

You could here some gasps and sighs as people slowly and silently went to work. But not me. I was frozen. I forgot how to walk. I forgot how to breathe. Even if I could move I didn't know where to move to. Even though I've been in this building surrounded by these people for 6 years I couldn't identify anything familiar around me. I told myself, ""Dude you have to start taking a step"" cuz once people were familiar again they started noticing I hadn't moved and I knew they would try to talk to me. and i couldn't form words the rest of the night. the best I could do was, "" i, you , tha, for..:"" I couldn't do my job so I stood out of the way by some equipment and looked up and stayed that way til my shift was over. i got in my car and cried for 7 years now.

It is beyond heartbreaking. It takes your loved ones and turns them into different people who are sad and are never the same. Their thoughts are all dark and hopeless. I know that you don't understand the impact but it is huge. It is not a cool thing to do.

Other things to consider are not all attempts are successful. You could F yourself up real good and have to live forever like that.

And there is the possibility you may spend eternity suffering in hell. no one knows for sure but definitely no worth the chance.

And life is cool. rarely are things as good or as bad as the seem.

You will have many many more boyfriends. loneliness comes and goes but things always get better.

When you feel this way go find some old people and spend time with them, play a board game or help them with something or just sit and talk with them. This is one thing I guarantee will take your mind off things and make you feel great. it will cure almost everything on your list that sucks.",1,,2025-01-21 9:44,t3_1i6copl,,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1i6copl/ive_completely_given_up_on_myself_and_plan_to_end/m8boc5z/,Neutral

28390,m8bsgwg,comment,,"This is one of the hardest experiences a person can go through, and it can profoundly impact those who love and care about you. It’s worth noting that most people who survive a suicide attempt often express immediate regret after taking action, realizing it wasn’t what they truly wanted.

These thoughts can become a dangerous spiral if left unchecked. It’s essential to break that cycle and not let the idea take hold. Suicide can become a fixation that creates tunnel vision, making it harder to see the bigger picture and the possibilities still ahead of you.

The late teens and early twenties can be an incredibly challenging time. You’d be surprised how many people feel the way you do right now. I’ve been through it myself, and so have many others. You’re not alone in this, even if it feels that way.

What helped me was finding purpose and meaning through hobbies and exploring career opportunities. Hobbies and career paths can lead to new connections and open doors to people, places, and ideas that bring fresh energy into your life.

Even something as straightforward as exploring a degree or career field that excites you can give you a sense of direction. Having goals to work toward, no matter how small, can help ground you and give you hope for the future.

Take some time to find things you genuinely enjoy. Gaming, for example, can feel like a meaningful escape, but it often provides a “false purpose.” Turning that interest into something like live streaming or content creation could give it more meaning—and even the potential for a career—but balance is key.

Life can feel overwhelming during this transitional stage, and that’s completely normal. Remember, it’s temporary, even if it feels all-consuming.

Another perspective to consider is that depression isn’t a permanent state. It’s more like waves of emotion caused by chemical imbalances. These waves come and go. If you ride them out, calmer moments will come. Dwelling on them too much, however, can pull you deeper into difficult waters—but even if you fall, you can always climb back up.

Something that might sound simple but has helped me is focusing on physical health. Joining a gym, setting fitness goals, and learning to cook healthy meals not only improved my physical well-being but also gave me a sense of control and accomplishment. These activities release natural “feel-good” chemicals in the brain and can make a noticeable difference in how you feel.

Our brains are wired to seek satisfaction through progress. Goals like getting fit, eating better, picking up a new hobby, or exploring a career path all provide a sense of purpose and achievement that gaming or passive activities often can’t replicate. Similarly, if you’re unhappy in your job, it’s worth exploring what else might align with your passions—it can truly transform your outlook.

Finally, remember that time is a powerful healer. Be patient with yourself, and trust that good things will come, even if they feel far away right now. You’d be surprised how baby steps of progress each day towards an ultimate goal can compound and add up over time.

From my experiences of going through very similar moments in my life is to not allow yourself to continue deeper in to the cavern of despair! It’s hard to do, but don’t think that you can’t get lower, as the reality is you can, but instead CELEBRATE what you have achieved in your life, the fact that you still manage to get up everyday… celebrate that you actually haven’t reached the bottom. 

By being able to actually achieve every day, even if it’s simply getting out of bed, that’s a win, bathe in that win, and repeat that win to yourself in your head, out loud, what ever works for you, no matter how small the win is ALL DAY, and your mind will start to feel better, you will feel better about yourself. This isn’t be far a quick fix, but trying to retrain your brain to live the tiny positives will help, you head will lift, your mood will lift and your ability to get out and socialise will come.

Don’t expect to be able to suddenly find the best friends, relationships etc. as so many people are actually in your same position and are hiding and not letting themselves be seen, they don’t think they are worth it, that is not your fault, so don’t take it personally if they don’t respond to you, it’s not you it’s them. But adding a smile to your face and managing even the tiniest spark of positive energy will attract people to you and lift them also, the result somewhere down the line is a connection, the result loneliness and a lack of self worth will gradually become less.

All you need to do is to get there. If you give up, you'll never have that. You can give up anytime. So why giving up now? 
I postpone everything in my life, tasks and stuff... So I obviously postpone ending life for later.
There is some much to enjoy... Music that makes me happy. The ocean. Travelling. Enjoying a good movie... Lots of stuff.

Anyways, I looked out if the window and saw a flock of parrots. Lots of green parrots! Now, it's not a rare sight at all. During the past couple of decades their population grew dramatically... But I just laughed. Like, isn't it crazy? Live parrots roadside. When I grew up, most if the birds I saw daily were pigeons, crows and sparrows. Parrots were exotic, seen on TV or a fancy pet store... And I was so happy about that simple moment.
About sunsets, clouds, stars, blossom and so many more great thing the world has to offer. Things that do not depend on other people, just us...

28401,m8bu3ix,comment,,"Mostly carbs lol. But the healthy kind. I went to a wholistic doctor 15 years ago who used to be MD but changed to DO (doctor of osteopathy), who changed because he was an MD and just prescribing pharmaceuticals rather than healing people. He had a great approach to simply try lifestyle and nutrition changes first and had a board certified nutritionist on staff who was not just someone who got certified but someone who actually understood nutrition. 

Basically, in a nutshell, they tell most if not all people do eliminate these two things: All dairy and all gluten, period. Next, eliminate all bad habits (smoking \[including marijuana\], heavy drinking, dipping, vape, etc). Finally, eat real food, especially starches that have a moderate to low glycemic index. Lots of color, so you want to look at salads, bowls, soups, etc. And eat as raw as you can which gives you the most nutrition - stay away from canned and overcooked things. Also, starches give you a sense of satiety and are very high in energy and fiber while being very low calorie. Last, lots of fiber so nuts, seeds, etc. 

The problem with the American diet is we're overfed and undernourished. Our cells are starving while our bellies are full. High protein this, no carb that, it's opposite of what we need. You want thirds - third carbs, third protein and third fats, but make them all natural, little to no processed foods at all. If you can't pronounce the ingredients, then stay away from it because it's processed or has chemicals. 

You lose weight. You have energy. You sleep better than babies. Your mind is clear. Your mood is great. Your hormones are stable. You breath better. You never feel hungry. It's a life change, no doubt but if you can manage it then it's really awesome and you feel completely balanced. 

Last night I made a Greek style bowl with grilled chicken (no tzatziki), hummus and crackers from seed flour. Amazing meals like this you'll learn to love. I make two loafs of bread on Saturdays with Bob's Red Mill Paleo Flour for awesome fresh gluten free bread. I have a table with crock pots and a rice cooker all with timers so I can set things quickly in the morning and when I come home things are done and ready to eat. So yeah, lifestyle changes but it's worth it and it becomes nothing more than doing dishes or laundry weekly. 

I would encourage you to seek a DO or a board certified nutritionist that cares about nutrient-dense eating. All this high protein high fat no carb stuff honestly is just cholesterol building, hormone killing bad way of eating. It'll make you skinny, but unhealthy and feeling like crap. Hope this helps! And sorry so long, just kind of started typing and didn't stop lol."," Mostly carbs lol. But the healthy kind.

I found it really hard to make friends and I was really lonely. I was in a very toxic long distance relationship. I couldn't sleep at night and I stopped going in to uni. I hid in my room as much as possible.

 At 20 I moved in with a group of 6 other women. I only knew one of them vaguely. Before long they became great friends and were like a lifeline for me. I met my best friend of all time and she pretty much saved me from my depression. I was still depressed but I wasn't alone in it quite so much. 

A few years later my toxic relationship ended. I was devastated at the time but realised quite quickly that I was far better off. Only 6 months after that I met my now husband. we have been together for 15 years. I often think back over my life and wonder how things would have worked out if I had done things differently - if I hadn't been depressed would I have done better at uni, would I have a better job? Would I have travelled more etc. but then I think that if anything had happened differently then I wouldn't have met my husband and we wouldn't have our beautiful son.

I knew about her infidelity, from being involved with a few guys from school to sleeping with her boss. I chose to forgive her, hoping she’d change. I never confronted her, keeping my pain to myself and pretending everything was fine. But in December, I discovered she had done it again—this time with a neighbor living next door to her.

That was the breaking point. I couldn’t confront her. I was shattered emotionally, so I decided to leave everything behind. I moved out, cut ties, and am now planning to leave the country. I live alone, staying in the dark most of the time.

The trauma has consumed me. I barely eat, sleep, or interact with anyone. It feels like this is how the rest of my life will be. I don’t see a way out of this darkness.

It wasn’t even a proper breakup because I never said anything to her. She was always so sweet and nice to me, constantly telling me how much she loved me and how she wanted to marry me. But deep down, I knew I couldn’t stay with someone who kept betraying me behind my back while pretending she had done nothing wrong.

I've been here. Exactly where you are. 
My first relationship, we were together fully since we were 13. Lived together from 17. Then at 22 I found out she'd been charging guys for sex in our flat while I was working. Shed been sleeping with literally loads and loads of strangers. 

I've never known suffering like it and believe me I understand. I nearly didn't make it through. I self harmed, I made serious attempts, I was just utterly broken for about 3 to 4 years. 

And then it got better. Yes it left it's deep scars, I can't help but have issues and trauma after it. 
But I'm happier now. I'm more comfortable on my own but also in a beautiful poly relationship and really happy.

28483,m8c6twh,comment,,"I always tell people, those who say they love you but do the opposite in action have some sort of disorder, like NPD.  For a person to do this, they have trauma themselves, to such a degree that they harm others.  You spouse clearly had issues, to the point she presented a false persona to you, to get your admiration, affection, love, attention. 

but in reality, which she obviously hides from everybody and does behind your back, speaks of someone horrible, vile, disgusting that’s her real self. 

but she hides that you see, because she knows no one would accept her.  However, people always miss this; and fall for the fake personality, or get the two mixed up. 

They look at the partner they believe the other person to be, the person they “know” the one they expect.  

So when evidence shows up that counters your own beliefs about your partner, you look at them through two lenses. 

1. The one you believed them to be and with this cheating and betrayal which doesn’t add up to you.   So you give them the benefit of the doubt, the forgiveness because you expect your partner to behave like you know them too.  (This is false). 

2. The other lens is what causes the depression, the upset, the monster you don’t wish them to be, but to much evidence has mounted up and you can’t ignore it now and this is why you sit in a room depressed, alone and in the dark.  (The truth). 

You must reconcile these two parts, and realise your partner was actually a selfish, uncaring, can’t love anyone but herself, monster.  

Realise that there are people out there that do this, without remorse, they present a fake persona, because they are too ashamed of their true self, that weak, cowardly, manipulative robot. 

Only then can you begin to heal.  Learn from this, and you will become more self sufficient and self reliant and extremely more educated on the people around you; better yet be able to discern who are the authentic genuine people and who are not. 

They are out there, this happens to people all the time, this is far more common than everyone believes.   

Heal yourself (which you can and will do, it is okay to mourn and feel like the world has ended it is normal.) But all storms do pass my friend.  They do, no matter what and this is it is just a rite of passage, a scar, one you will heal from but won’t forget and it will one day have no sting, with it only having lessons and reminders of red flags you will spot in others way way sooner than before.  

Future tip:  if somebody cheats on you, it is a sign of no respect for you, this is unlikely to ever change.  If somebody doesn’t respect you, they do not love you, this is a golden rule, how humans function.  You should have left the first time she cheated, you staying only taught this type of person with this type of personality that it was okay to cheat.  

but this is the big flaw in their personality style, they cannot learn, they can fake having learned, they can fake remorse, fake guilt.  

but they cannot do it genuinely and learn, as a healthy person who did cheat would feel genuine remorse, genuine guilt, genuine regret and real emotion forces a person to change, because it is painful.  

This is the difference, unfortunately this can be hidden and is hard to visually see as it happens within us.  

So stop blaming yourself.  You didn’t do any of this, be realistic, hold that person accountable, be cold and ruthless with this person, don’t fall for the charade anymore.   

Because there are people out there designed to do this, they can’t be any other way.  They live their entire lives as fake weak cowardly people, saying one thing doing another it’s a compulsion.  An illness a disorder.  

Throw this away, you can do better and deserve so much more, but don’t rush.  Take your time, slow your life down and heal first. 

but be armed with this knowledge, learn from this.  I’ve been through it, with partners, friendships.  I’m still here.   

It’s what life is about, being able to discern what is truly good for us and what is bad for us, sometimes though the bad disguised itself as the good, but it is the worst bad in the world once you catch it.  But by the time you figure it out, and held it for so long, you both love and hate it and it’s hard to let go. 

but what you dealt with isn’t a normal person, they’re not healthy and never will be.  Remove the lens which lied to you, that tricked yourself, the one she sold you. 

She was never good enough for it.  Yet you gave it so freely because you were inexperienced, and you grew up with her.  

but she decided to put on a front, she decided to deceive you, she decided to never let you really know she really was.  Trace that back to its origin. 

and you realise.. wait a minute.  I don’t need to give second, third or fourth chances.  Because they don’t value them.  So I also don’t need to value them.  You literally give back to people what they deserve truly.  Not ideals or hope, but action.  

They’ll call you evil, call you the bad one, but you know the truth, and that’s all that matters.  What you know to be true, because if you don’t someone will make it up for you.  

So ask yourself why? But you know the truth really your just caught between two lenses the truth though is that she is a coward, a liar, a cheat, a manipulator, and she can tell you one thing but do another.  Those types don’t change, those types don’t want change.  Those types cannot, it’s literally impossible.  Because they survive like this.  It’s how they get by. They’re so afraid of reality, they NEED to do this to people, good people that genuinely loved them.  

Start to be realistic, start to allow yourself to see them for what they really are.  It’s not easy, but over time you begin to accept that and you detach and move past them.  

They will forever do this, in one way or another, sure they’ll pretend they’re fine, moved on too and probably really give it a good go, because you shook their world by leaving.  

but overtime, years even.  Reality will creep in and they can’t do anything but do what they know to manage it.  Which repeats the cycle.  Unless of course they decide to live differently to spite you, which means you control them externally but by never even being there, which is a good thing, no more people get hurt, but these types are wired to enjoy hurting others.  

So life becomes incredibly dull and boring after awhile.  Hence the cheating to find filament, excitement, the lies.   They need to do this.  It’s deeply embedded and it’s not your job to wait for that change or fix it.  

Good job on leaving, you just started the most painful journey but this journey and process will lead you to such a better life, but first you need to feel all the pain, and emotion and rest, recoup and slow down.  Take your time.  Your body will balance back out and heal, and one day from now, you will wake up and feel ready to tackle more.  Far more educated and experienced, more resilient and prepared.  

You’re only going up from here, with more information, it can only get better.   You don’t know it yet but I do, because I’ve been there.  

Ahead of you are the best days of your new life."," I always tell people, those who say they love you but do the opposite in action have some sort of disorder, like NPD.  For a person to do this, they have trauma themselves, to such a degree that they harm others.  You spouse clearly had issues, to the point she presented a false persona to you, to get your admiration, affection, love, attention. 

but in reality, which she obviously hides from everybody and does behind your back, speaks of someone horrible, vile, disgusting that’s her real self. 

but she hides that you see, because she knows no one would accept her.  However, people always miss this; and fall for the fake personality, or get the two mixed up. 

They look at the partner they believe the other person to be, the person they “know” the one they expect.  

So when evidence shows up that counters your own beliefs about your partner, you look at them through two lenses. 

1. The one you believed them to be and with this cheating and betrayal which doesn’t add up to you.   So you give them the benefit of the doubt, the forgiveness because you expect your partner to behave like you know them too.  (This is false). 

2. The other lens is what causes the depression, the upset, the monster you don’t wish them to be, but to much evidence has mounted up and you can’t ignore it now and this is why you sit in a room depressed, alone and in the dark.  (The truth). 

You must reconcile these two parts, and realise your partner was actually a selfish, uncaring, can’t love anyone but herself, monster.  

Realise that there are people out there that do this, without remorse, they present a fake persona, because they are too ashamed of their true self, that weak, cowardly, manipulative robot. 

Only then can you begin to heal.  Learn from this, and you will become more self sufficient and self reliant and extremely more educated on the people around you; better yet be able to discern who are the authentic genuine people and who are not. 

They are out there, this happens to people all the time, this is far more common than everyone believes.   

Heal yourself (which you can and will do, it is okay to mourn and feel like the world has ended it is normal.) But all storms do pass my friend.  They do, no matter what and this is it is just a rite of passage, a scar, one you will heal from but won’t forget and it will one day have no sting, with it only having lessons and reminders of red flags you will spot in others way way sooner than before.

28491,1i6hozf,post,Stealing around $600 worth of cologne in the past year from ulta ,"(ALLEGEDLY)

Sorry I know this is a long post I just want to if I’ll be ok.

Hi I’m a 17 yo and me and my friend have been stealing cologne from ulta for around half a year now, we do it every couple weeks to couple months this most recent time however was the closest I’ve been caught. Apparently after doing my research cause I’ve been worrying all night they most likely know you stolen the first time you did it. I also saw that the employees don’t really care and that the price they can charge you I think is like $1000 where I live. To start things off the cologne testers that I steal have stickers on them that beep if they are stolen, I knew this so all the other times I took them off but the time before the most recent one I forgot to but it didn’t go off. This is where I messed up, I was in a rush so I decided to just leave the sticker (fyi my friend was doing it too) and also we bought smth w cash so we didn’t look as suspicious since all the other times we went around Christmas so it looked like we were just trynna find some Christmas ideas. But as soon as we walked out the beepers started to beep and I could hear the employee that just ranged us up say “oop”, I know they aren’t aloud to like chase after you or say anything about you stealing but I don’t really think she cared. It has been around 12 hours now and I’m still rlly stressed, also an old friend of mine was working that day so I bet she would’ve texted me if I was in some serious shit (knock on wood).","Stealing around $600 worth of cologne in the past year from ulta  (ALLEGEDLY)

28514,m8cav58,comment,,"Well don’t be like the person I married she also tried to kill herself on Christmas Day. I wasn’t the greatest husband but I loved her. Strange things started to happen in our relationship my telephone  began to get hacked. My watch began to get hacked. My Internet at my home was hacked. My truck was hacked. I brought this to her attention and she told me don’t worry about it so I stopped, but it started to consume me because I started to notice things change about her as well. She was doing drugs. She moved out before she moved out. She started hanging with a girl who was smoking methamphetamines she said she moved out because I told the girl to mind her business. We had a situation where she didn’t come home two or three times and she spent the night out one of the night she asked me to pick her up I couldn’t do it. I have been drinking and I was very tired. The girl had to be a lesbian her and her girlfriend the very next day when I came to my wife’s job. I asked her. Why didn’t you come home? When you told me you were on the way home her lesbian friend started to tell me what’s wrong with her. Spending the night out with someone and not coming home. I told her to mind her fucking business because people that are married. Don’t not come home to their partner, my wife used it as excuse to tell me that she was moving out because I was rude to her friend at her job with all I said was mind your business and the girl continue to talk. I told her to get the fuck out of my business. My wife separated from me for a couple of months I got into a car accident and I was with my two kids in myself I was low and limited on funds because I had a great job but my insurance only paid a fourth of what I made what I made 3600 every two weeks. I only got about 700 for the month which I had to make stretch between me and my children. My wife turn left and move to another state, took my children with her. I didn’t fall down and cry in bag when she told me that I didn’t do the right thing because I should’ve been on the floor, pleading and begging her not to leave me or she accuse me of cheating in my plant that I worked at which by the way I made $31.78 an hour. Why would I cheat and risk losing my job while I’m at work when I could just take a two hour leave until the person to take a two hour leave versus getting caught at work. I followed her back to where she stayed. She told me not to come because she already found someone obviously by the way we’re still married. I get back to where we’re from. She was very mean very nasty and very condescending to me. I started to see more science that I was being hacked by her. She spent the night at my house I put her phone in her tablet to her face. It opened up and I was able to see the apps that are in my phone and her phone and her tablet before she came to my house to spend the night and fuck me and put me to sleep when I fell asleep. I woke up to 300 apps on my television. There were also in my phone in her phone and on her tablet, she told me I was seeing things I was losing my mind. Don’t worry about it. I started to sign that she was becoming to be a prostitute. She told me don’t worry about it I’m losing my mind once again before I met her mind you, that’s what her job was. I paid my children money to give me her locations her phone number and it was always at a hotel but she told me it was me at the hotel. I never did tell her that I was bribing my children to tell me with money and they told me I will come to her house. There will be lingerie all over the floor 4567 different outfits. She told me my keys were playing with the outfits. Mind you one of my children is a boy.

Come to find out . She has numerous bank accounts she has houses in my name and her name so please don't be like the woman above the 777 lady"," Well don’t be like the person I married she also tried to kill herself on Christmas Day. I wasn’t the greatest husband but I loved her. Strange things started to happen in our relationship my telephone  began to get hacked. My watch began to get hacked. My Internet at my home was hacked. My truck was hacked. I brought this to her attention and she told me don’t worry about it so I stopped, but it started to consume me because I started to notice things change about her as well. She was doing drugs. She moved out before she moved out. She started hanging with a girl who was smoking methamphetamines she said she moved out because I told the girl to mind her business. We had a situation where she didn’t come home two or three times and she spent the night out one of the night she asked me to pick her up I couldn’t do it. I have been drinking and I was very tired. The girl had to be a lesbian her and her girlfriend the very next day when I came to my wife’s job. I asked her. Why didn’t you come home? When you told me you were on the way home her lesbian friend started to tell me what’s wrong with her. Spending the night out with someone and not coming home. I told her to mind her fucking business because people that are married. Don’t not come home to their partner, my wife used it as excuse to tell me that she was moving out because I was rude to her friend at her job with all I said was mind your business and the girl continue to talk. I told her to get the fuck out of my business. My wife separated from me for a couple of months I got into a car accident and I was with my two kids in myself I was low and limited on funds because I had a great job but my insurance only paid a fourth of what I made what I made 3600 every two weeks. I only got about 700 for the month which I had to make stretch between me and my children. My wife turn left and move to another state, took my children with her. I didn’t fall down and cry in bag when she told me that I didn’t do the right thing because I should’ve been on the floor, pleading and begging her not to leave me or she accuse me of cheating in my plant that I worked at which by the way I made $31.78 an hour. Why would I cheat and risk losing my job while I’m at work when I could just take a two hour leave until the person to take a two hour leave versus getting caught at work. I followed her back to where she stayed. She told me not to come because she already found someone obviously by the way we’re still married. I get back to where we’re from. She was very mean very nasty and very condescending to me. I started to see more science that I was being hacked by her. She spent the night at my house I put her phone in her tablet to her face. It opened up and I was able to see the apps that are in my phone and her phone and her tablet before she came to my house to spend the night and fuck me and put me to sleep when I fell asleep. I woke up to 300 apps on my television. There were also in my phone in her phone and on her tablet, she told me I was seeing things I was losing my mind. Don’t worry about it. I started to sign that she was becoming to be a prostitute. She told me don’t worry about it I’m losing my mind once again before I met her mind you, that’s what her job was. I paid my children money to give me her locations her phone number and it was always at a hotel but she told me it was me at the hotel. I never did tell her that I was bribing my children to tell me with money and they told me I will come to her house. There will be lingerie all over the floor 4567 different outfits. She told me my keys were playing with the outfits. Mind you one of my children is a boy. My phone told me I was in Iowa my phone told me I was in Colorado hell my phone even told me I was in France Spain at all kind of different cities  Think is the woman who posted above whatever her name was 7777 I'm pretty sure that's my wife and that's a dirty shame that we're still married and she has found someone else to get married to I've seen the ring numerous times and she tells me that it's fake or my little girl gave it to her my little girl found it on the bus and gave it to her I've seen pictures and videos of her being dominated by someone she moved in with me her and my children and she was doing the DDLG/ABDL.

The only way I could describe it to anyone was that there was a literal void, a dark and ominous abyss that seemed to follow my mind everywhere I went. Food had no flavor. Movies gave me no laughter.

My therapist helped change my life and you can always make new friends and find people to be in your corner.  Breakups make everything so much harder too. I do not say that to dismiss what you are feeling because your feelings are completely valid. I just want to give you some hope because I have experienced similar things.

When I was 19 I was super insecure and had never had a significant other, but now I truly love myself and of course I am still insecure some days but that’s okay it’s a journey and I just try to correct myself in the moment and speak nicely to myself by replacing the harsh thoughts I have about myself with positive ones. 

 I ended up needing medication to help with my anxiety and depression. If you talk to someone and you have anxiety or depression, there is nothing wrong if you need medication too. It is also okay if you don’t need medicine. I just want you to know you are not alone. I care about you and want you to know I am rooting for you.

28557,1i6jaup,post,I lied about my role at my job for the last 2 years. ,"Same as title. I lied about being in a higher role than I actually am and the guilt has been eating me alive. My parents and one close friend know that I am not in this role. In fact, I just now earned my degree. I pretended to go to work the past 6 months so no one would catch on but in reality I was going to libraries/coffee shops to work on my online classes. I know it’s awful that I lied and this sounds a little insane, but if I hadn’t taken off work I know I would have never completed those classes.

I go through an on-the-job training that lasts for a few months (clinical experience) and while I am thrilled I would love some emotional support from those who are close to me. It’s a horrible combination of feeling proud of myself for doing the work and overwhelming guilt for lying. 

I’m not sure how to navigate this situation. I could come clean to my friends but I don’t want that to ruin our relationships. I do understand actions have consequences though and I should not have lied. Otherwise, I could continue with this lie until I actually earn the title of the job I said that I already have.

You have some hard and deep work ahead of you.... journaling, writing letters, finding way back to yourself, therapy etc.

What helped me is when I heard one budhist monk talk about hapiness and how it is a CHOICE, that hapiness does not tie to external factors in only depends whether you choose to be happy or not and learn how to ucltivate your hapiness.

I was laying on the floor doing some progressive muscle relaxation and when I relaxed my jaw, eyes, chest, hands, legs, feet, felt my body completely relaxed only things I was aware was my breath and my heartbeat and felt incredible joy of just simply being.

Telling yourself you need X or Y to be happy is a lie you tell yourself, you have a choice. 

It might be a strange concept but when you accept you sufferring and you feel pain, you can still be happy....just need to learn to accept and let go, not resist."," The problem is if you tie your hapiness to others, thinking that if you are alone you can't or deserve to be happy.

You can get help with funeral expenses from the DWP so that's certainly worth looking in to, but don't assume that her debts have to be cleared just because she's passed either.

I'd also ring Shelter as well and explain your situation as they're specialists in this sort of thing.

How easy is it for you to get to your local council office ?.

The reason I ask is that a while back I was living in a flat and the landlord decided to sell it and issued me with a Section 21 notice to quit.  I turned up at my local council office literally every day for two weeks straight asking for help and eventually I saw someone who'd worked in a London council who understood my situation and made sure I got a flat.

You can always DM me if you like.

The well wishes for a happy life I know are genuine as well as telling others to put up the good fight...

I fucking hate that people feel this, I hate that you, me, and the list of others in the comments feeling it.  I'm still broken over Robin Williams and Chester.  I fear for Jim Carrey...

Some people here say to find a reason to live.  My reason, I live out of spite.  

My mind wants me gone so badly that I keep almost dying.  21 years old I was dying from Eclampsia and HELLP syndrome.  I had a 5% chance to live and my daughter had a 10% chance - she was only one pound when I was forced into an emergency section
  The funeral was planned.  I'm here and she just turned 14.

At 33 I was diagnosed with Stage IV Triple Negative  Breast Cancer two years ago.  Prognosis was bad.  I was thinking FINALLY I'm going out and no one to make me feel bad...but then cancer pissed me the fuck off...and, well,  now I'm 18 months cancer free.

Passed out while driving, had a loaded gun pointed at me, drove into a lake...not to mention dealing with Manic Bi-polar disorder and depression...everything wants me dead and now I'm like of giving the universe the bird and daring it to try.

I still have a specific place planned and time of year I want to take myself out.  What all to use and when to call 911 because I don't want some poor random person to find me.  Don't want to traumatize someone else for my own actions...

Maybe it's my inner soul (if you believe such a thing) is more stubborn over my own consciousness on sticking around.  But, staying alive out of spite to continue giving the universe a big 'fuck you' for using me against myself has given me reason.  Or maybe I loath the idea of being a statistic.

Fucking sucks being alone in it.  Relationships are a challenge but so is life.  Sorry for being a freaking cliche.  Obviously I want you to live long and prosper (Trek nerd), I don't want anyone to fall to this mental issue.   I want you to give that mental illness a mental 'fuck you' and keep going.

Find those short term goals if that helps - like, seeing spring time or fall...whatever season you like.  A new movie, video game, see how the Tiktok ban (again) falls...keep yourself curious. 

Or, what I've done before is finding reasons to not do it.  What stopped me last time? (I'm not gonna die when its freaking -2° outside.  I want to feel being barefoot on the grass when it's warm again - then, maybe) - or maybe mentally say (I need to respond to this comment, because, my god, all the freaking Grammer and spelling errors this fool needs to be aware of)

I wish you well.  You're young.  Too young to feel this shit.

....yes, I'm gonna me one of THOSE people saying it....therapy helps.  It does."," I can sit here and tell you you're not alone (hell I've been told that a million times) - it's also like when I've battled cancer when people kept telling me to be strong...😩

I totally understand this. I don’t think i’ve had a genuinely good birthday in years. however, I have had a lot of other days that have brought me joy. 

as someone who’s attempted and almost succeeded (was in the ICU for 2 weeks, then needed to stay at a rehab for PT for 3 months and a bunch of other appointments following), I hate that I ever did that. because at one point I was so mad I was alive, having to fight back a mistake I made years ago, but now i’m grateful to be alive. however i’m stuck with a ton of health issues the rest of my life. I found joy again, but everyday i’m fighting some kind of medical issue. I wish I could go back and never had done that. I constantly wish for an eraser. please reach out to your friend, get help. you deserve it. you’re loved. you’re valuable. your existence brings joy to a lot of people. 

PS - if there’s one thing that has always kept me going, it’s the fact that there are thousands of people I have yet to meet in my lifetime. and I look forward to learning the impact I have on their lives."," hey! happy belated birthday!

You could still go to the concert you know hanging around the front in the crowd you may be able to find somebody desperate for a ticket that you could start talking to them and you could chat to other people in the crowd as you all have the same interests at heart. You may just make some friends with your same interests in Coldplay. Whatever you do don't let people overhear that you have paid tickets on you as you could get jumped for them and if you do start talking to someone who is keen to get into the concert make sure that he is talking to be a genuine person or potential friend before giving a tickets away
You could test them by saying fuck man I wanted a drink but those lines look to busy now. See if they actually have nice personality and are genuine cause if they are keen for the ticket or are OK to sit near you then a genuine person would go over and stand waiting to get you than drink wouldn't they
 Also if you do go don't get caught handing out tickets if cops see you giving tickets they may think you're scalping tickets for money which will put you in the watch house for the night and then face court
So be careful. I do hope and pray that you don't leave us

I have BPD, as well as bipolar disorder. I came to the conclusion a long time ago that this is just me… and it’s who I am. But I’ve been able to regulate my emotions… after 3 years of actually putting in the effort to do so.

I too, have been a horrible person to people in my past. Rather it be a relationship or a friendship.. I have had my fair share of bad experiences. Many that of which had led me to believe that I was an unfixable piece of shit. It was hard for me to even look in the mirror sometimes. The guilt was unbearable. I’ve really fucked up a lot. 

Living with your mistakes is not easy, and losing someone who meant so much to you is certainly not easy either. But it’s apart of life. You will feel heartbroken, you will feel hurt.

Apart of what I’ve come to appreciate with my disorder is that I can feel things so heavily. It may be totally shit to deal with at times, but it’s beautiful in a sense. Nobody feels love as deeply as I do, nobody feels sadness as deeply as I do… nobody feels happiness as deeply as I do. Every feeling is like an out of body experience. I try to have a positive outlook; a positive outlook is what truly makes or breaks it for me. 

I think, that while life can be terrible, that it’s beautiful. The fact that we have the ability to
Love, care, think and feel is just so beautiful to me. There is beauty in everything.

28704,m8dkdnw,comment,,"I understand to some degree the struggle and pain that you're suffering from. I certainly understand the feeling of wanting to leave everything behind within the physical life because of intense internal emotional pain, anger and disgust with oneself and feeling like there's an inability to ever change it. 

I've struggled with this quite a bit in my life, especially after I came back from combat in the army. 

What I can tell you is that each time you choose life, something happens to you and you become a bid more resilient, a bit stronger and a bit more capable of doing the inner work of healing yourself. 

Beneath the labels of borderline personality and bipolar or any other clinical diagnosis. There is an amazing Soul and Spirit that is working towards some of the hardest lessons of your life so that you may self-actualize.into something and someone better. 

I know what it means to lose so many people in one's life and despite one's best efforts to still lose people through their own choices. 

Each time I consider it exactly what you're doing. I thought about all the pain that I would leave behind in a sense came through to me that I would not be escaping my own psychic and emotional pain. I would take it with me beyond the physical and still have to come back and do this over again, but also carrying the extra burden of the pain that I caused others by leaving too soon and of my own free will. 

I want you to consider what if ending. It does not stop the psychic and emotional pain that you're feeling. What if your Consciousness continues and you carry this all with you? 

Somehow, I think the lessons of life and the difficulty that we choose speaks to the strength of our inner dwelling spirit. We first have to choose love and forgiveness for ourselves...after some time becomes more apparent that others deserve that same love and grace. 

We can help the inner child heal through this type of work and also understand the actions of our consequences through a dialectic process. Your therapist can help you tremendously, but I want to encourage you that you have the power to shift and change and grow and forgive yourself. You're not a failure. You're simply a human being having a very human experience. And you are loved and surrounded by love and surrounded by encouragement. So please take all of our sentiments into consideration. 

We don't have to know you to love you. You simply are a part of all of us and we are a part of you. Drawing that strength my friend and please continue on things. Will get better a little bit at a time and when you look back you'll be glad that you stayed the course."," I understand to some degree the struggle and pain that you're suffering from.

They need to make the decision to forgive or not, it’s not up to you anymore. And you need to find a therapist to figure out why you felt the need to do this.

28759,1i6pbd0,post,"I took credit of my friend’s idea, and nobody knows that","this is not that deep, but i wanna tell u guys anyways so u give me what do u think about it. 

Basically, when i was younger i lived in another city and i had this friend that was hilarious. One time he made up this one word that we started using daily, of which we only knew the meaning. I had to move out of that town and ive never seen that friend again, even tho we still kept in touch for some time. 

Obviously i was still used to the way i spoke with him and i still said that word occasionally. My friends started using it after they found out the meaning and i told them i invented it. everyone i know (even friends of my friends) started using it thinking i invented it and i became popular in my school for it. Its been 2 years since i finished school and i still know many people who use it and find me hilarious for it and its became my “signature”word, i name many accounts with it and videogames names. 
I think its “not that deep” but i never gave my friend even a bit of credit and i dont really feel great about it. ","I took credit of my friend’s idea, and nobody knows that this is not that deep, but i wanna tell u guys anyways so u give me what do u think about it.

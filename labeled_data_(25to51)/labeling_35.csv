20419,m7x3kqi,comment,,"Has to be the most ignorant comment so far! Your vagina is inside of your body I'm not sure if you're a man or a woman but you are very clueless. 
I stated several times that I said my armpits and my groin area those are bodies of skin on the outside of our bodies! 

I have not had any issues My pH balance was not thrown off because if you know you're groin has nothing to do with your vaginal pH. That was the case I probably would have had a fish odor discharge or uncomfortable symptoms like that I never mentioned any of that. 

I do hope that a kid that has tried any and everything for years and smells of onions would try what I'm doing and be happy that it works.

I hate that you are having to go through a break up and recovery with your leg. I shattered my tibia and fibula, broke and dislocated my ankle. So I feel for you. Having to learn to walk again was an emotional struggle.  Hang in there. Find a good outlet or something to help take your mind off everything while you’re recovering. 

Hope you have a speedy recovery."," I’ve been in a very similar situation. He would always need his space (PTSD) and basically disappear for weeks.

There is sooooo much more to life to explore, you are only 15, at that age it’s such a struggle to try to fit in, trust me I have been there, but at the end of the day, you don’t need to force yourself to make others happy, make YOURSELF happy FIRST. Please don’t give up, trust me life can be so beautiful.

20553,m7u1s7q,comment,,"So.

Sad update.

I still haven't used. God, I want to. With every fiber of my being.

I'm currently sitting in a hotel room with my partner. She drove me here. My supposed-to-be boss paid for us to have a room. 

I was ready to go. Fuck me, I was  excited. 

She is currently having a lapse into psychosis. I won't get into too much detail for her sake. She's talking to the voices. Having arguments and vivid memories of things that never happened. They're violent and terrifying. They're real to her. 

She's an incredible person when she's sober. Kind, loving, forgiving, intelligent. I could go on.

I place no blame on her. Not gonna lie, I became frustrated with her. No name calling or violence, but I definitely said things I wish I didn't. I told her the voices weren't real. Provided proof. Shit like that. Told her she was going to ruin everything. 

That was on me. I take responsibility for my part.

When my boss arrived to pick me up, I had to make a decision. I couldn't just leave her. She was sobbing and possibly a danger to herself. Still is as I write this. I have some of it on video, just in case it escalates and I need to prove that I'm nither high, drunk, or violent.


 
Again, it's not her fault. It's not like I'm mentally sound.
But fucking god damnit. She almost fucking ruined this.

I was told that I have a chance again the weekend after next. Told not to have her drive me. I agree.

I care for this woman dearly. So much so that, even without a second chance, I'd have still stayed.

Now I have two weeks to wait until I can try again. I don't know if I can stay sober. I dont know if I want to. 
 
Every step I take seems to lead back to addiction.


I feel so fucking hopeless, you guys. Not like  boo hoo poor me. Just... I don't know, apathetic? 

I'm gonna try again. At least that's where I'm at now. 
It's breaking me to see her like this, especially sober. 

Anyways, sorry for fucking up your time everyone.

 Thanks for listening."," So.

Sad update.

I still haven't used. God, I want to. With every fiber of my being.

I'm currently sitting in a hotel room with my partner. She drove me here. My supposed-to-be boss paid for us to have a room. 

I was ready to go. Fuck me, I was  excited. 

She is currently having a lapse into psychosis. I won't get into too much detail for her sake. She's talking to the voices. Having arguments and vivid memories of things that never happened. They're violent and terrifying. They're real to her. 

She's an incredible person when she's sober. Kind, loving, forgiving, intelligent. I could go on.

I place no blame on her. Not gonna lie, I became frustrated with her. No name calling or violence, but I definitely said things I wish I didn't. I told her the voices weren't real. Provided proof. Shit like that. Told her she was going to ruin everything. 

That was on me. I take responsibility for my part.

When my boss arrived to pick me up, I had to make a decision. I couldn't just leave her. She was sobbing and possibly a danger to herself. Still is as I write this. I have some of it on video, just in case it escalates and I need to prove that I'm nither high, drunk, or violent.


 
Again, it's not her fault. It's not like I'm mentally sound.
But fucking god damnit. She almost fucking ruined this.

I was told that I have a chance again the weekend after next. Told not to have her drive me. I agree.

I care for this woman dearly. So much so that, even without a second chance, I'd have still stayed.

Now I have two weeks to wait until I can try again. I don't know if I can stay sober. I dont know if I want to. 
 
Every step I take seems to lead back to addiction.

Currently I go through phases. It used to be a massive problem and I was getting so many infections. My psych got me on some good meds for bipolar disorder and my dermatillomania improved immensely.

Now I seem to have relapses (relapsed about 6 months ago, still ongoing with the picking and eating). I'm hoping I'll stop again soon.",1,,2025-01-17 23:53:45,t3_1i3gvx2,,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1i3gvx2/i_suffer_from_auto_cannibalism_and/m7pwdsz/,Neutral

About five years later and I no longer do that!! I found that doing the same action, but on a piece of clay/slime literally anything else other than myself helped. It definitely didn’t get rid of the feeling of wanting to cut myself but it helped me ease out of that feeling.

I think the big thing is to identify why you crave the feeling and what you can do to somewhat get that feeling, without hurting yourself. Being able to do those two things is gonna greatly help you in the long run."," Hey!

It first started when I was 12, watching tv in the kitchen, and my foot was itching. I was a constant nail biter, nervous about anything around me. Being hard of hearing also didn’t help; as any sound alerts me to wonderment, but also scared. Scratching my feet with no nails wasn’t doing me justice, so I had a plan on using a steak knife.

I was extremely careful with scratching my foot, until I noticed I was peeling the skin,and from there…. I started to cut deeper. I wasn’t actually CUTTING the skin, more like “shaving” it. No bleeding or anything, but the sensation of feeling the skin ripping off was, weirdly satisfying that I ended up doing it on both feet. It evolved to the point where like you, I used a nail clipper to cut small pieces, and then pull it off. The whole sensation was just… I dunno, I wished it never stopped. It made me FEEL alive, like I am not dreaming.

I’m also a constant cheek biter, and every time I go to a dentist they URGE me to stop doing it. The problem is, it’s an unconscious behavior, and I do it out of habits. I’m attempting to get a night guard to wear to hopefully cease this. 

It’s been 3 weeks now since I last “cut” my foot to eat the skin now. My feet do get calluses due to constantly “shavings” and “clipping” that i now use a callus shaver, and don’t always have the desire to eat my own skin. 

The other thing I liked about chewing the skin, was how TOUGH it was. It was like, a soother for me, and I could try to bite onto the skin as HARD as I could, and then I feel better.

I have a belief now, that it was all because of me living in An anxiety ridden home, and it caused me to be extremely alert about everything that I couldn’t regulate myself.

There’s worse things than smoking weed.

But, remove the cue and stimulus from your environment is my suggestion 
Don’t bring it with you. 
Take it away from where you usually partake.

20797,m7n1uyj,comment,,"I’m 66 years old. I first tried weed when I was 11, I was already drinking and smoking cigarettes by then. In the 70’s I tried other drugs that were around but didn’t like the high so just stuck to weed and alcohol.
I probably smoked weed every day since I started working full time at 16. 34 years ago I quit drinking. About 20 years ago I was noticing I wasn’t getting very high anymore and because I applied for a job that drug tests I quit for 3 months got the job I didn’t get drug tested and everyone else was drinking and doing other drugs. I got a good high for about a week then the same thing. For one thing when everyone else was passing a joint around I wouldn’t have a hit, just smoked a whole 1 myself. I’ve had to quit a few times again because they said I had to drug test to start a new job. I never did get tested. I then learned how to make BHO and got a good high for a while. Then back to the same thing. Before weed was legalized I was smoking some shitty weed and got pissed off so  I went to a medical dispensary and told the young lady there, I don’t drink, do drugs or take medication because I smoke weed but I don’t want to see a doctor she said no problem give me your license and I’ll set you up then anywhere I went I just showed my card I got weed for about 2 years then it became legal. After that I would buy 4, 6 10 ounces whatever and different kinds of hash. Then I  would make BHO hash and weed joints. 1 time 1 of my joints got 9 people high while I smoked a whole 1 myself that’s when I realized it would be cheaper to have a heroin habit. I wish I could post a picture of my briefcase with my jars that hold an ounce grinder papers pipes and hash. So now we had to drug test to work for a certain company so I decided I would quit once all my shit was gone. I quit in September. Then I decided I’m not quitting weed to cover for the alcoholics and druggies and decided to look for another job. I haven’t been trying very hard because I’m getting my pension now and if nobody calls me back by the end of the month I’m going Gold Panning again and starting to smoke weed again. It’s already in my mind even though I don’t get very high it’s the reason I’m not on medication. I don’t sleep very well without it. It helps me deal with anxiety and the pain from old age. I’m not a burnout, I work cause I’m bored. And before I quit smoking weed I was on the way to quitting cigarettes. If I woke up in the middle of the night instead of a cigarette I would have a couple puffs of weed and go right back to sleep. During the day I was down to a cigarette every hour or hour and a half. So my best advice is when I quit everything else I had to quit hanging out with friends for a while until I was strong enough to say no then my real friends accepted it after. So be strong cut down by using a clock. I don’t know how much you smoke but maybe today if you feel like a puff wait an hour. Then an hour and a half or 2 it gets easier all the time. It’s okay to cheat once in a while. You need to keep busy and set goals. Start doing something before smoking so you don’t get lazy. I go gold-panning and won’t smoke until I find a flake then next time a bigger flake or 2 or 3 be as stubborn about quitting as you are smoking and remember you can become immune to it and maybe that’s why it leads to harder drugs and alcohol. Good luck."," I’m 66 years old. I first tried weed when I was 11, I was already drinking and smoking cigarettes by then.

Tremors so bad I could hardly walk straight, vomiting, extreme dizziness, sweating so bad I had to change clothes several times a day, blood pressure spikes from hell.

Remove it from your space- make it a pain in the ass to access (which is becoming more and more difficult to do since it’s everywhere now)

Start doing Ramabong- no smoking while the sun is up

Only consume it in your least favorite form (for me that was edibles …. Took too long and hated the high)

Find another hobby that has a ritual to it- weed for me was just as much about the process and strain curation as it was the high- if not more

I've quit decades long addictions to weed, nicotine, alcohol, cocaine, caffeine, and porn.

I tried it next on alcohol. Worked like a charm. After drinking for 28 years steadily. Left it without a hiccup after few days of study. 

Quit weed and cocaine the same way. 

Recently quit porn by simply looking at myself instead of the screen.

Surprised how easy it is.

Just recently got sober after a health scare from other drugs. But tbh, it’s almost harder to quit herb cuz other than making someone lazy, it doesn’t really cause severe health impacts like other drugs do. I was recently hospitalized for nitrous oxide abuse, but was on damn near every drug under the sun too (coke, k, prescription opiates, lean, benzos, and cannabis) It took a younger homie crying (first time I’ve ever seen him cry) to even realize how fucked up I was. I had complete facial paralysis, and it woke me the fuck up.

OP… honestly, don’t have magical answer for you, but the best I can do is suggest that you find the root cause of why you toke so much.

After a decade of heavy/constant morning to night use, I describe my experience as marijuana turned on me.

Many medical heart tests / blood tests later and I was given a clean bill of health for my concerns, prescribed an anxiety medication for the worst moments.. it definitely helped me quit in a hurry when each time equalled hours of unavoidable agony.

20866,m7q2o08,comment,,"N2O, nitrous oxide. It can cause severe neurological damage including and not limited to severe nerve damage, paralysis, B12 deficiency (nitrous can inactivate our body’s ability to use B12 which is vital to nerve function), hypoxia, stroke, and cranial nerve dysfunction. I was using around 3000g minimum upward to 4500g (roughly a 10-lb tank or 375-562.5 whippets) per day for around 10 days straight which led to me being hospitalized for a week. Keep in mind that during oral surgery, you’re only using around 30-50g of N2O that is mixed with oxygen and used under medical supervision. 

I’m lucky too because I have a younger homie that abused nitrous that had the same symptoms as I did along with nerve damage in his extremities, causing him to lose balance in his feet. His friend that was abusing N2O with him in fact, lost complete function of his leg, so he needed to be carried to the car to take him to the hospital as he could no longer walk. There’s stories such as Connor Wilton, where he lost complete bodily nervous function which caused him to become a quadriplegic and put into diapers for extended periods of time, and from my understanding he is still dealing with the effects of his abuse.

I had thought by Google research that nitrous oxide was one of the safest drugs, but Google is probably thinking that you’re going to do a few whippits (8g cartridges) or balloons, not sit at home all day hitting a huge tank to the dome from the moment one wakes up to the point where I could pass out. Further compounding that belief was the fact that nitrous oxide is legal and sold at every smoke shop. One of the saddest parts is that before I had even stopped usage, my tolerance was so high that I wasn’t even feeling high anymore, rather, was just using it as a ritual of sorts to avoid the day and my emotional state. On a personal level, I would say it was almost addictive as methamphetamines (which I was highly addicted to for several teenage years.) All around, bad news. If anyone here abuses nitrous, my suggestion is stop before you potentially cause long lasting or permanent issues. If anything, I hope my story could be a cautionary tale for others."," N2O, nitrous oxide.

Anyhow, they made their whip cream in these refillable 2.5 gallon stainless containers, they’d fill with cream and then pressurize them off a big tank in the kitchen. The waitresses would dispense the cream onto the sundaes they made. When they were empty of cream, they’d come back to us dishies. They’d often still be pressurized. I took a big long pull off one while standing in the dish area. Everything turned all soft and warm and then the world jumped up at me. When I woke up a few moments later I was face down in a puddle of grease and dirty water on the floor. I woke up and somehow nobody walked in and found me, totally got away with it except a bloody lip. Not my finest moment, and from then on, and later in life, I always walked right past the guys with balloons at Dead and Phish shows. No thanks, I’ve tasted dirty dish water already haha. 
I have a thought for you, something I’ve learned that helped me in life. When I was younger I saw things in absolutes, I was either drinking or not, smoking or not, etc. Either state made me feel equally either bored or guilty. I’ve learned to add other things into my life that take up time and provide me benefit, and then when I do not meet my expectations I cut myself some slack. Smoking weed only evenings, then add a Tuesday night class, now You’re only smoking six nights a week. Add something else, now You’re down to five nights. Then add an exercise routine to eat up more time. Try to become so much more than addiction that it matters less by comparison.

You are going to peak at 30, unlike everyone else who pathetically peaked in High School.",8,,2025-01-17 06:29:05,t3_1i3a69m,,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1i3a69m/if_i_dont_get_a_partner_by_age_30_im_going_to_off/m7l8u6v/,Neutral

If you base your self-esteem, and in this case whether you should live or not off your ability to be in a relationship with another person, you are putting yourself in risk to two things; being completely dependant of your emotional state on someone else, and being in a codependant relationship. Neither of which is healthy. A partner should be an add-on to what you already are, rather than a foundation of what you are.

20882,m7l942h,comment,,"This is going to sound unsupportive or callous, and I want you to know that I intend it to be anything but.   
  
You are putting an enormous amount of pressure on relationships. That is a horrible formula for ending up in very toxic situations (or driving anyone who might otherwise want to date you away). 

I've seen your post history and you've said things like, ""I can fix another person but I can't fix myself,"" and ""I need a girl with a rescuer complex."" As someone who has dated people hoping I can ""fix"" them, this ends in tears. For everyone. 

While I'm sympathetic to your loneliness - and I also understand that a situation goes beyond loneliness.  You fear that no one will ever want you, or want to share romance with you. The longstandingness is just as terrifying as the loneliness, and it makes you think that there's something about you personally that makes you undatable: something you can't hope to change. 

I'll say the obvious here: being the sort of person who has these sorts of beliefs: ""I'm unfixable,"" ""I'm going to kill myself if I'm single at 30"", ""I refuse to go through life alone.""... etc. these sorts of beliefs do not make you very datable. If I had a crush on one of my friends and they started espousing those sorts of things, I would think twice about dating them - not because they're unlovable, but because that would promise a lot of hardship and suffering that I couldn't in good conscience sign myself up for. 

I am your age, also 26. I have had 9 relationships - so I know many of these things, from your perspective, are easy for me to say and meaningless to you. But something I can tell you is that nothing magically changed between my 0 and 1st relationship. And, since my most recent relationship ended, I am fundamentally just as alone as you. As sad as that can be, sometimes, there are legitimately other wonderful things about life that might be found when one becomes open to them. 

If messaging to talk through this would help, you have my ear - but I suspect you are not quite ready to move to a more constructive mindset regarding this. (And by constructive, I do not mean you should repress your own sadness about being single. That sadness is valid and I will not ever try and tell you that you should not feel it)."," This is going to sound unsupportive or callous, and I want you to know that I intend it to be anything but.

But hear me out. 

If there is one thing I've learnt it's that a relationship does not solve problems, or suddenly make you happy without conditions or effort. Relationships cannot be forced, they are hard work and are often fostered from organic interaction and are found when you stop looking or are just focusing on living your best life.

If there is any advice I can give you it's simply just to focus on being the best version of you that you can be, to be yourself and not act differently around prospective partners. Go out, find hobbies, do what makes you happy any then things fall in place. 

I spent my early 20's seeking out love and being convinced I needed love from someone else to be convinced I had self worth. I could not have been more wrong. I needed to work on myself, socialise more, meet new people and most importantly, learn to love myself. 

I'm (believe it or not) pro euthanasia and allowing people to leave this earth with valid reasons. I don't plan on living a long life if it's miserable, but dude, take the advice, go explore the world (even your community) a bit and things fall in place. Join a hobby, volunteer for something in community events, if you're in university sign up to extra curricular clubs and make an effort to meet people

Speed dating nights can be a laugh, just think outside of the box and keep and open mind.

I met my partner though a girl I met on tinder that never really worked out. But an invite to a birthday party from a friend I made on tinder was the introduction to a gorgeous lady who lived literally around the corner from me that allowed me to get out of the ""I've been single for way to long and I'm starting to hate myself"" era. It was this very relationship that made me realise that sometimes proactively looking or focusing on a single person is the problem. Be you, be happy, put yourself out there and sparks pop up when you least expect them.

Yes, work on yourself. Work on being the best version of yourself that you can bring to a relationship for YOU, and let it be authentic. Get out and meet people. Sign up for a class, volunteer, get involved in something you have interest in. Be around people (without expectations for any kind of romantic interaction) and work on communication.

You owe it to yourself to be happy alone and wait for the person who will add value to your life in the same way you’d add value to theirs.

You obviously aren't bettering yourself and doing ""better"" if you haven't even forgiven yourself for the core problem my dude. You say you've done all the leg work, and plan on going to therapy, but you really gotta let go of the past with this topic. It's baggage. You can only carry so much and still fly.

Forgive yourself. Forgive your past. No one is perfect. Join local groups that involve your hobbies, but don't count on it as a dating service. It will at least expand your social network. Or at least provide the opportunity, if you haven't done so already.

Definitely get that therapy going ASAP man. I hope you can look back on this one day and laugh and feel proud for getting past it"," ""Comparison is the theif is joy""

>Am I really a catch if I’m still some awkward teenage boy on the inside, because I’ve no experience with relationships? I could be Bill Gates but I’d still stumble over words with a girl I’m interested in. You’re 33 and you separated from a long relationship. Thats a lot different than being 26 and never once having a relationship, ever. I can’t “have my shit together” if I literally have no relationship experience whatsoever.


Two things:
1. Women are people, just like you. Any woman you're interested in will have a multitude of flaws, just like you. Treat them, first and foremost, like equal people, not as romantic prospects. This will help you empathise with the women you encounter, and make it easier to find common ground to build a relationship (romantic and otherwise) on. That's a big part of why straight men who have genuine friendships with women also tend to have less difficulty meeting new women.

You undoubtedly have many positive qualities - all of which many other men will lack, because men are heterogenous and each one has their own set of dynamic strengths and weaknesses. The qualities of the women you encounter are also heterogeneous. Difficulty talking to a romantic prospect is normal, but you need to remember that while you need to impress them, they also need to impress you. The next woman you're interested in romantically may well objectively be a 10/10 human, and yet I guarantee she will still have plenty of insecurities, feel nervous getting to know people she likes (platonically and romantically), feel like she needs to impress them, etc. - just like every other person does. Stop projecting your insecurities and assumptions onto these women, take them off the pedestal you've placed above you, and next time you catch yourself putting a woman back on it, remind yourself that she's out there hoping that the things she's doing in life are enough, just like you are, then interact with her with the same consideration and decency that you hope to receive in return. The rest will eventually follow.



**------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**
2. Most people reject most of their romantic prospects. You need to get comfortable being rejected - **not** because you need to learn to accept a life of rejection, but because as you become more comfortable experiencing rejection, you will naturally become more comfortable talking to women.

Rejection is scary for everyone and it takes exposure therapy to overcome. The more experiences you have with rejection, the more opportunity your subconscious has to learn that even the most unkind romantic rejection as an individual event actually doesn't matter. Yeah, it sucks, it's temporarily disheartening and a blow to your self esteem, but ultimately life still goes on, the parts of your life that bring you joy are still there and the possibilities for you to expand that joy are too.

Being confident in the knowledge that when the next woman rejects you, you'll still be the same worthwhile person with potential that you've always been, will make it easier to avoid your nerves overcoming you when you talk to someone you like.

I recommend doing this by going to speed dating events. Many women go to these with a friend, and there's no reason you can't go with a friend or acquaintance too. Even if you can only go alone, every person there is in the same boat and you'll no-doubt find someone (man or woman) who you can at least commiserate/laugh with at the after event about whatever mortifying faux pas you will have inevitably committed (because everyone at these things feels like they've made at least one gaffe) on the day.

Anecdotally:
Your lack of relationship experience doesn't mean that you are not a catch. For the women who you're well-suited to, your other qualities will make you a catch in spite of your relationship history. 

I'm a woman and on paper, I have pretty much always been a 'successful' individual for my age and stage of life - both in what I have/had some measure of control over (e.g., high-level white collar career, active lifestyle), and in what I don't/have not had control over (e.g., conventionally-preferred physical build/features). I do have experience with significant and long-term relationships; I'm generally confident, I mostly like myself as a person and I feel lucky about a lot of aspects of my life.

Since I am exactly the kind of woman you would likely become tongue-tied around, I'll tell you of some of my personal experience. When people who don't know me well make assumptions about my experiences, one assumption they will often make is that I don't have much experience being rejected. In fact, I went through a period of despair that I would never have a(nother) relationship, and every single one of my friends (comprised of men and women across a large spectrum of appearances, economic statuses, jobs/careers, etc.) have all gone through the same thing. To deal with it, I started intentionally approaching meeting people and dating in general with an open mind and putting myself out there, even when I knew there was a high chance of rejection - and boy, did I get rejected a ton. I also got accepted plenty, and my frequency of being accepted increased as my fear of rejection decreased and I got better at managing my feelings of inadequacy. **The main points here are that, 1. every person you feel nervous around actually wants to be accepted just as much as you do, and it's worth remembering that when you feel yourself starting to react to a rejection that hasn't happened yet; and, 2. practice makes perfect.**

And to give you some reassurance, I personally wouldn't rule out a romantic prospect based on something like a lack of relationship experience at your age or in the 30s, nor will every woman you're interested in. Yet, based on my perceived flaws and insecurities, someone with your strengths and weaknesses may well rule me out - and that wouldn't be a commentary on me or on them, it would simply reflect a misalignment of our qualities and values when it comes to romantic relationships."," @OP re your comment:

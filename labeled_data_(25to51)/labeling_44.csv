Sadly right there you shouldn't have done that. 

Everyone is saying ""tell me where and I'll go or pay"" but end of day, did you discuss this with others you hoped would go? If not, you messed up. Let this be a lesson and move on in life.

Else, if everyone agreed then know there are folks who would like what you are and be there regardless. They aren't your friends.

Now ifyou bought this (didn't include this in description) then you need to go somewhere else for friends. 

Hard truth if you didn't but hey, you got folks all over who would mind hanging out now. Maybe these folks are 10x better. Take a chance on them. Else, tone down expectations.

What having been through depression myself a few years back I found the following to be of benefit 
1) exercise every day at least 30 minutes. It’s got to be as intense as you can do. start gentle and build up so as to not shock the system too much.  Reason is it builds confidence, releases dopamine (makes you feel good) and after you’re done for the day you feel more relaxed and helps you sleep
2) find things you enjoy and add value to your life hobbies sports etc. 
3) make friends with people that have similar values and priorities, you also have to recognise that around 25-35 life gets more complicated so priorities change etc
4) remind yourself that you are enough. Focus on being your best you and keeping yourself healthy 
5) get enough sleep. I won’t say sleep at 10 and get up at 5 or whatever you know what you need way better than I do, but just make sure you get enough sleep. 

I hope these help you like they helped me. Best of luck"," My man. Depression and loneliness are serious threats not just to mental health but also physical.

6 years ago I made this thread with a throwaway account. A lot of people reached out, just like they have here, and gave me the strength to make it just another period of time. It's the first time I've looked at it in 6 years - I want you to have the same experience with this thread here.

I'm here, climbing, doing better. It was a slow path, but every step forward was mine. It was grueling at times, but eventually the grueling became simply difficult, then the difficult became challenging, and the challenging became fine, and the fine became happy.

Just hang in there and keep fighting the grueling nature of it. Look for any resources you can find. Trust yourself and the thousands of voices here cheering for you."," https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/s/HUWu09L97M

25514,m7r6yua,comment,,"I want you to know that when my son,  my only child, was murdered on March 5, 2025. I really was so lost as if someone had stabbed me straight in my heart, or reached into me and ripped my heart out of me!

This year will be the 20th anniversary of his passing. My birthday is only a few days afterwards. I have been grieving for 20 now. I can't seem to find peace with it 

This year I lost my 4 siblings. I only have a granddaughter that my son and I were blessed with her beautiful presence. She was 8 months old when he passed.

Now she is in college, her sophomore year, and is too busy to visit or call me. I'm very proud of her accomplishments over the years, and am very impressed with her choice of profession! Neurosurgeon!

I missed out on her childhood as her mother chose to sign both her daughters over to CYFD ( formerly CPS, Child Protection Services). They were both placed into Foster Care. Fortunately, they were adopted by the foster family, who were a financially sound, compassionate family. But, I missed their growing up. Sure I was able to call them and went to their extracurriculars, but I missed out on so much more.

Yes, I feel that I am also very alone now. I'm 67, a mother and grandmother, have no family save my granddaughter and her sister, which I became her grandmother too when my son married her mother. I made a promise to them when my son died that I would always be their grandmother. And I have been to the best of my ability.

I tried to commit suicide after my son passed. If they had not saved my life, I wouldn't have known these precious granddaughters!

May I tell you now, blessings can come out of tragedies! It is a blessing in disguise, from GOD Himself. You are not yet ready to die in His eyes!

One piece of advice I would like to leave you with, and I’m talking from experience, being a 44 year-old male who has felt lonely all his life – if you take the time to work on yourself, you will realize that in the grand scheme of things, it doesn’t really matter what anybody else thinks of you, including your family, but yourself. And the only way you’re going to build more self-confidence, self value, and self love is to work on yourself, one small, consistent, and long term horizon minded, step at a time. It compounds 👍

25566,m7r8skb,comment,,"Here’s a more concise version without run-on sentences, fluff, or redundancy:


---

I’m 28 years old, and it’s 12:25 AM. I have tickets for the Coldplay concert on January 26th, my favorite band, but I don’t want to attend anymore. I have three extra tickets, but none of my friends agreed to go with me. I booked them hoping someone would come, but no one did. The seats are in Block B, WW100 to WW103. If you find them empty, it’s because I’m not going. It’s not that I didn’t want to go; I really did. But no one agreed to join me.

It’s not just about the concert. I live alone, and my family is in a different town. I see people getting tagged in birthday posts, but no one tags me. I didn’t even get a call from my family. I used to have a friend who called me at midnight every year, but today, I didn’t get that call. I asked my office colleagues to celebrate my birthday, offering to pay for everything, but they had plans for the weekend.

I feel like a terrible person. I always wish others well, but no one seems to care about me. Maybe it’s because of how I look. I have vitiligo, and I’m not as successful as others my age. Maybe that’s why people don’t like me. I can’t change how I look, but I wouldn’t hate anyone for it. I think maybe people do.

I also wonder if I’ve always been the problem. Maybe that’s why my parents don’t love me the way they love my brother. He’s successful and living abroad with his wife and dog. I didn’t even get a birthday wish from them. It’s okay though. They might have forgotten. I still hope my brother becomes more successful. Last year, he forgot my birthday too, and my friend who always called didn’t call either. He said he was traveling.

I don’t think people care about me because I don’t add anything to their lives. I only take. If I left, I don’t think anyone would be deeply affected. I’m a terrible person, and maybe that’s why my ex got married to someone else. She made the right choice. Who would want to be with someone vulnerable?

When she told me she was getting married in three weeks, I didn’t shed a tear or say anything emotional. I just said, “Congratulations, enjoy your life.” She probably thought I was heartless, but I was heartbroken. I can understand her decision, though. Maybe you can see why I feel this way.

Isn’t it better to sleep forever and not know what happens?


---

Edit: I don’t know what to say now.

I woke up to nearly 2,000 messages of support. Last night, I felt completely alone, but now my phone is blowing up with birthday wishes. It’s the best thing that could’ve happened.

I also saw that some people want to attend the concert with me, and I’d love that. Thank you to everyone who’s reached out. I’ll try to reply to all 200+ comments in my DMs.

It’s incredible to go from feeling so lonely last night to seeing that 2,000 people care. Thank you, Reddit, for showing me the world isn’t as bad as I thought.

Thank you again, everyone. This feels like a miracle, and I love you all for it."," Here’s a more concise version without run-on sentences, fluff, or redundancy:


---

I’m 28 years old, and it’s 12:25 AM. I have tickets for the Coldplay concert on January 26th, my favorite band, but I don’t want to attend anymore. I have three extra tickets, but none of my friends agreed to go with me. I booked them hoping someone would come, but no one did. The seats are in Block B, WW100 to WW103. If you find them empty, it’s because I’m not going. It’s not that I didn’t want to go; I really did. But no one agreed to join me.

It’s not just about the concert. I live alone, and my family is in a different town. I see people getting tagged in birthday posts, but no one tags me. I didn’t even get a call from my family. I used to have a friend who called me at midnight every year, but today, I didn’t get that call. I asked my office colleagues to celebrate my birthday, offering to pay for everything, but they had plans for the weekend.

As someone who has had an unconventional life and often led a very solitary existence: my best advice would be to think about what makes you happy/excites you. And then go do those things. By yourself even. 

Sounds like you’re a music person, love the generosity of spirit you try to show people by buying multiple tickets. But honestly just go by yourself. You like art? Go to a museum by yourself. Into weird food? Take yourself out to eat. At the end of the day we can have the best friends/partners/family, but at the end of the day all we have is ourselves. All of those people can and will disappoint us. 

If you are able to truly live your life regardless of who is or isn’t with you then nothing else matters. And there’s always the possibility you’ll run into like minded people on your adventures. 

And also - comparison is the thief of joy. Don’t get too caught up comparing your insides to other peoples outsides in online spaces. Being a person is a nightmare for most of us, so you’re not alone!!"," Hey bud - just want to chime in -

And yes, I know that sounds cliche, but no bull shit, I've felt the same as you. I'm 37. I have lived in NYC for 12 years and my father, brother and mother have collectively visited me 4 times in that tenure. Shit, they even come to NYC, and not told me til after the fact. Really, why'd they have to tell me? You know why, because they're asshats. Fuck'em all. Find your own happiness! Yeah I'm still working on it myself, but that's it. Find your happiness, fuck everyone else.

Go to Coldplay. I'm not gonna volunteer to join you, well bc I think they suck. I'm more into real rock, like real grunge, and sadly they're all dead because they couldn't find their happiness. 

If anything, go to the show solo! Find some old folks, like me, but like Coldplay. Maybe they're looking to scalp and you can make their decade! Or find some youngins, or some hippie boomers, go out and make a new connection, lasting, real, spontaneous, connections!! It'll be a forever remembered event, much more than a random redditor potentially taking advantage of you when you're suspectable.

Keep on going on man. You have a lot of potential and opportunities if you can afford 4 Coldplay tickets, lol. Fuck'em all and do you!!! Take all your privilege and advantage and turn the screw, or don't. Just live! 

Also, seek therapy and a psychiatrist. Meds changed my life and 3 weeks into therapy after 1.5yrs of meds, I'm more hopeful than ever that there is hope!

25587,m7r9by9,comment,,"HAPPY BIRTHDAY!! I promise you, there is so much left to be lived. Here is something I wrote to myself to keep myself going when I was younger, I still go back and read it sometimes to this day —

“we’re all limited to one life. no matter what you believe in, no one really knows what comes after all of this even if they swear they do. 
we’re all so very limited. to just so many smiles, to how many people we get to meet, to how many people we get to be. so I guess this life is all about the choices we make. don’t ever say you had no control over who you are because you have all of it. 

yes of course, you are limited. I mean there are millions of people on this earth you won’t get the chance to meet. so make the most & fight for the incredible ones you have had the luck to. this life is all up to you; how many people you make smile, what kind of person you choose to be, what you decide is worth fighting for, because everyone has something they would give everything for, whether it be a person or a passion. It’s all up to you. 

I hope you make the most out of the life you were given & I hope you learn to let go of the things that did not matter. that test you failed in high school? that won’t matter when you’ve graduated college & have a job. all of those people that left & you thought it was your fault? that won’t matter in 10 years or so when you wake up next to the love of your life & get to pull them closer. yes, all of the things you don’t want to remember will still be there, but I promise you someday it won’t all hurt so much. 

You were made to fight to live, it was the first instinct you had when you were born. To live. to breathe. so don’t you dare give up just yet. never forget to live for yourself first. yes, you will need other people but at the end of the day we’re all we have. 

so yes, we are limited to the amount of people we get to meet, how many books we get to read, how much we laugh, & even the types of people we choose to be. 

we may be limited but we sure have enough, & I hope you choose to live. I hope you choose to live.”"," HAPPY BIRTHDAY!! I promise you, there is so much left to be lived. Here is something I wrote to myself to keep myself going when I was younger, I still go back and read it sometimes to this day —

“we’re all limited to one life. no matter what you believe in, no one really knows what comes after all of this even if they swear they do. 
we’re all so very limited. to just so many smiles, to how many people we get to meet, to how many people we get to be. so I guess this life is all about the choices we make. don’t ever say you had no control over who you are because you have all of it. 

yes of course, you are limited. I mean there are millions of people on this earth you won’t get the chance to meet. so make the most & fight for the incredible ones you have had the luck to. this life is all up to you; how many people you make smile, what kind of person you choose to be, what you decide is worth fighting for, because everyone has something they would give everything for, whether it be a person or a passion. It’s all up to you. 

I hope you make the most out of the life you were given & I hope you learn to let go of the things that did not matter. that test you failed in high school? that won’t matter when you’ve graduated college & have a job. all of those people that left & you thought it was your fault? that won’t matter in 10 years or so when you wake up next to the love of your life & get to pull them closer. yes, all of the things you don’t want to remember will still be there, but I promise you someday it won’t all hurt so much. 

You were made to fight to live, it was the first instinct you had when you were born. To live. to breathe. so don’t you dare give up just yet. never forget to live for yourself first. yes, you will need other people but at the end of the day we’re all we have. 

so yes, we are limited to the amount of people we get to meet, how many books we get to read, how much we laugh, & even the types of people we choose to be. 

we may be limited but we sure have enough, & I hope you choose to live. I hope you choose to live.”",1,,2025-01-18 5:05,t3_1i3oqiz,,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1i3oqiz/todays_my_28_birthday_and_i_am_going_to_end_it/m7r9by9/,Neutral

Hey Radyoz,

Happy Birthday! 🥳🎂🥂🍾 Wishing you a year filled with endless joy, love, and growth.

Remember, it’s not about where you start but where you finish. Look up the story of the man who started KFC or how many lenders turned Starbucks down for a loan. Seasons and tides always change—your time is coming.

Use this season to rest, recharge, and pour all your energy into yourself. You’ll be amazed at how things shift when you focus inward.

Life may not be easy or fair, but it’s always a blessing. So keep pushing forward—we can’t wait to see how incredible your 28th year will turn out to be✨✨✨","

As a 28 year old on my 28th birthday, I sat all alone and drank an entire bottle of whisky all alone. Topped it up with two bottles of wine and countless cigarettes.

Unusually idk if it’s only me or others.. birthdays also somehow the most loneliest days of the year.

if i lived near you, even though i dont know you, i would go see coldplay with ya! my birthday is on the 31st of this month, and i quit trying to force people into my life by taking them to concerts or anything like that. i just do things for myself, and if others (happens rarely) want to join too, then cool. if not, still cool. you seem like a pretty cool dude, dude, so just try thinking of positive things in life. its hard to do that, thats just the way life is, but the end results are much more rewarding than being negative and angry about things all the time. its way to easy to have those emotions, thats how they are designed, its set up to break the mental psychy. keep your head up, things get better. and if you wanna hear a damn good song by a damn good band, check out the song by ween called, if you could save yourself (you could save us all) the song is just excellent. let me see if i can link it, if not, i highly recommend it! so, if you see a link in this comment, please click it! you wont regret it!

No one outwardly reaches out to me to do an activity, it's always me. Many of my friends live in another country and the ones near by live more in the country than suburbs/city. And children, children definitely make people busy with low energy at the end of the day.

I'm moving to Japan in 2 months with so much on my plate, I need help with all the physical aspects of preparing for a move (packing, taking out trash, etc). It's daunting and my mind is just shutting down.

So, I get you. You're not alone. I cried reading the replies you got from everyone.

But even If they hadn’t had come, I still would have gone by myself.

25794,m7rglc6,comment,,"When I was younger people assumed I was happy, social, and had caring friends, family, etc. that were involved in my life simply because I was around others and in a generally good situation. I put on a smile and did what I did to get by. I’d learned that people assumed later in my life for whatever reason I never came across hurting, lonely, etc.

I saved up to get things or plan for others while working a lot during college, but nobody ever did anything for me on my bday besides my mom occasionally getting dinner with me. I never had a birthday party in my life. Never got anything from friends besides maybe a drink at a bar. Never got a special year event like many people get such as turning 21. My brother was similar OP, just a text or call was about it but once he had a family that slowly stopped.

I’d get or ask about getting tickets for events and invite a roommate or longtime “friend,” but they’d say they didn’t have money and couldn’t afford it…I offered to pay for everything, they still didn’t go. I’d go to a movie, comedy show, etc. to come home to them having ordered pizza, drinking with their gf or a couple other buddies while playing video games but they couldn’t afford less than $10 to go see a movie or go to a bar to watch a sports event and grab a beer. It was clear they just didn’t even want to go with me. One time I got 2 tickets for an NFL game because I thought I could surprise my grandpa to go, but he had a non-emergency medical condition my mom made an excuse for him to not go that it was just too much for him to sit somewhere for that long. He was convinced and I understood to an extent but figured someone would want it. I asked on social media a week before, directly to friends, family, etc. and nobody “could” go or didn’t want to spend the money (there was no money to be spent). I went alone and enjoyed the game in a bittersweet way.

I met my wife a few months later and have never looked back. I’ve since enjoyed many trips and events with her, made friends through her that completely changed my perspective of what people would do for others. I was more involved in their social lives and did learn to be a bit more direct in calling people out to reciprocate good relationships or learn to create good boundaries. I’ve shared lots of memories with my wife and now with our kids I try to show them how to appreciate that and recognize others. It doesn’t necessarily make anyone better for allowing that to happen to you, but know it can change. There are others out there who are willing to spend the time, make and share memories with you, and simply enjoy your company."," When I was younger people assumed I was happy, social, and had caring friends, family, etc. that were involved in my life simply because I was around others and in a generally good situation. I put on a smile and did what I did to get by. I’d learned that people assumed later in my life for whatever reason I never came across hurting, lonely, etc.

I saved up to get things or plan for others while working a lot during college, but nobody ever did anything for me on my bday besides my mom occasionally getting dinner with me. I never had a birthday party in my life. Never got anything from friends besides maybe a drink at a bar. Never got a special year event like many people get such as turning 21. My brother was similar OP, just a text or call was about it but once he had a family that slowly stopped.

I’d get or ask about getting tickets for events and invite a roommate or longtime “friend,” but they’d say they didn’t have money and couldn’t afford it…I offered to pay for everything, they still didn’t go.

There was a time where I also felt extremely lonely and like people didn’t care about me. Eventually I just decided to learn to be comfortable alone and funny enough the moment I was comfortable that way, people started to gravitate toward me.

From there I started doing new things and going to new places and eventually found good friends and now have an amazing wife. I do not need anyone else because of her.

And now i'm 29, every time i hear of someone younger of me dying whether suicide or accident or murder it makes me said, Even a year can make a difference, some of the biggest & best changes in my life happened in a matter of days or weeks, The amount you could miss out on between 28-29 is honestly insane, let alone when i hear people who are  25 or younger die, (like my kid is 12) if i decided to give up at 25 i would have missed my kid growing up from 8+. doesn't matter if a day or a month or a year is terribly hard,  it Can't get better at all if you give up on it :/ 

(I Don't judge people for choosing that way out, and sometimes mental burdens Are too much ""What doesn't kill you makes you stronger"" is a heavily biased opinion of the living. but i do believe in giving it a good shot and if you can, give it your all to claw out of that dangerous space even if you have to leave everything behind to do it.

People forget others because their lives consume their time. I can't begin to tell you how many friends birthdays pass and we just don't celebrate it. But if they were to call and make plans, I would be there in a heartbeat.

People get consumed by routines. It's been really difficult after COVID to socially interact anymore. 

I became divorced 2y ago. I struggle to meet or date. I'm almost 40 now. My world surrounds my kids and making sure they are happy.

I procrastinate. I eat snacks and sit on my computer instead of going out anymore. I'm becoming a slob, wasting away behind a screen. I live in a big empty house.

I'm sure if women had any clue how much money I make or how I am as a loving and caring person, I could work on myself physically and get back into my original fit and healthy and happy self again. But it's so much work. 

So... so much work. All to risk being hurt again.

My parents sometimes text me happy birthday, but otherwise unless I plan months in advance no one is really available to hang out. It's all online now, on little micro-communities on discord and instagram (which I don't have).

The world is moving on and I'm just kind of holding onto its coattails and going for the ride.

Don't feel this way about other people. You are unique and deserve to live and be happy, I know that loneliness is cruel, but unfortunately this is sometimes part of life. Seek psychological help, depression can be cured/controlled. Don't feel alone in this world full of people.

As for prejudice, that's people's problem and not yours.

Go to the show, alone or with the people who have offered to go with you. Enjoy life, life is short and you are here for a reason, find out what it is.

From everything I read, you’ve done not a single thing wrong. You’re not terrible. If anything, you have demonstrated more empathy and caring than most people ever will (even towards even those who have hurt you).  
Even if things look dark now, this is just a chapter in your life. There will come a day when you are happy, and content, and with loved ones, and you will look back on this moment and think, “I can’t believe how much my life has changed.” Getting through this difficulty will only make you a stronger, better, more compassionate person (and these are traits that truly make someone successful). 
Also remember that you always have choices in life. If you need to totally change your life, and maybe get a new job, or move to a new city (maybe the city where your brother lives, if he’s the person that best understands you), you can do that. You’re never trapped. You always have options. They can just be hard to see sometimes. 
I’m happy to hear that you’re feeling better after getting the warm response you got here. Please always remember the love that you have from all of these people, myself included. We love you!

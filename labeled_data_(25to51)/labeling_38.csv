22094,m76awkj,comment,,I totally agree with you! I think accountability and self preservation are important. The problem with SA is that a lot of times it doesn’t happen when putting yourself in “bad” situations. Lots of people play it safe and are still assaulted. It’s just not talked about. SA can look like saying no to a boyfriend you have had for a year because it hurts and they don’t stop. Or sleeping in bed with a same sex friend you think is safe and they touch you while you are asleep. How can you even have accountability in those situations. You have to live life and both of those situations should be safe. I still hold making out with someone you’ve known for years while their family is home should not be putting you any type of danger whether they were dating or not., I totally agree with you!

22105,m75ud6r,comment,,"I got fired from a company for which I worked tirelessly, day and night.

I am currently in the 3rd year of my college graduate degree, and somehow I managed to secure a job (essentially an internship) at a startup. After working there for about 3 months with dedication, putting in countless hours, I recently received a notice that the upcoming month would be my last paid month.

While my salary wasn't very high, I was content with it because I was working part-time and gaining valuable experience. However, I have now become a victim of office politics.

When I initially joined, the senior developer for the tech stack I was hired for had left the company, and I was the sole developer for that tech stack. I spent about one and a half months building a feature for the product. Unfortunately, when it came time to optimize the feature for better speed and lower response times, I fell short due to my lack of experience and proper guidance.

As a result, the company hired another developer with 4-5 years of experience, and he took over the responsibilities. Despite my hard work, dedication, and delivering decent quality work, this senior developer seems to have damaged my reputation in front of the manager. I’m not sure what they discussed about me behind my back, but it has clearly impacted my image.

Three days ago, the manager called me and informed me that the upcoming month would be my last paid month. After that, I could continue working on the project, but without pay, or I could leave the company altogether.

I am deeply upset because I gave up other opportunities for this job. I worked tirelessly, balancing my classes and dedicating my time to building this feature. In the end, the company gave me nothing in return, and now I feel helpless.

This was my first official job, and I treated the company like my own family. Now, I feel completely broken and don’t know what to do next.

Focus your energy in those bright souls and you see that you will meet a lot of good people and likely, made new friends. ❤️",46,,2025-01-12 18:13:15,t3_1hzshev,,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1hzshev/so_get_thisafter_im_left_with_no_pets_im_out_of/m6s4w6e/,Neutral

I was homeless for a while after becoming disabled in an accident and I hadn’t orange cat at the time. I lost everything except my cat, my car, and whatever I could fit in it because it took more than three years from application for disability to start sending me checks.  It was bad, for almost a year of that I didn’t even have health insurance to get medical care because my state didn’t want to expand Medicaid. I had zero income for all that time as well, I could only get food stamps so I was feeding my cat packages of salmon and tuna and then I was worried he was going to get kidney disease from the sodium.

I decided that if the day came where I had to sleep in my car, or if I lost my cat I would be done.  But we made it past all that, and then my kitty died and my mom died and I figured it was time to go, and that was when I was notified that I made it to the top of the section 8 waitlist so I didn’t have to be homeless anymore. And once I knew I had a place to live I adopted a little kitty boy who is the most loyal loving thing, he’s only six so I’ll have to stick around for a while because I can’t leave him with nobody. He freaks out if I go out to run errands and visit friends for more than a few hours.

Life is interesting because you never know when things could suddenly change for the good. And you want to be here for it. We only get one life as far as I know. Use up every bit of it, but if it does get too hard to continue Vermont will help people who don’t live in Vermont, but you do have to see a doctor in Vermont to be able to utilize their death with dignity laws"," Unless you need your husband for survival please dump him and see if your life improves.  I’m willing to bet everything gets better if you don’t have that anchor around your neck.

He passed away in his sleep and I refuse to feel one iota of regret after the hell he put us all through.

So sorry you’re going through this, and I hope you’re able to find peace.",3,,2025-01-12 06:17:46,t3_1hzb6my,,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1hzb6my/i_regret_hating_my_disabled_older_brother_after/m6pg0wm/,Neutral

That said, this situation is unique and is understandably very complex emotionally.

A mentally handicapped person is not culpable to the same level obviously. Having the mental capacity of a 6 year old demonstrates that testing was done and abilities accessed. Whatever the cause of that handicap, it wasn't just blindly accepted obviously. Time, money, and overall effort was spent to find out what was wrong, to what extent, and presumably what could be done about it. Meaning OP's parents clearly were capable of giving a shit about at least one of their children.

It's complicated by having the physical capabilities and statue of an older sibling, especially when the handicapped guy was an adult and needed to shave but is still doing these same behaviors. Additionally parents not recognizing the extreme nature of behavioral differences and *abuse* happening in their own home both as parents *and* caregivers while having at least two children is really disturbing to imagine and had to be life-altering. Imagine having supportive parents that cared for ALL their children. OP missed out, it seems like. I'm upset for OP.

Mopping stairs is weird to me, floors get mopped while stairs are often carpeted in homes where I live in the US but even if not carpeted, cleaning is normal. Forgetting to announce to *everyone* you're cleaning the stairs having done it plenty of times before is *only* a mistake. You can recognize that it was a mistake and it's understandable to feel bad about what happened, but accidents happen. Especially when we're talking about someone with diminished mental capacity.

As someone that has had a parent hold a grudge over something that I was indirectly involved in that involved a death, my experience told me that there was nothing I could do about how they felt. In my situation, my mom had terminal cancer and was private with her medical stuff to the point where she wouldn't even let me accompany her to her appointments, so I did not know how sick she truly was though everyone that knew her knew cancer would kill her. My father had started a new life after my parents divorced; marrying another woman with kids he spent far more time with anyway, my mom asked all of us to leave him out of everything as he had a new life and all of us respected that. When my mom died, my dad blamed me for not telling him how sick she was - I think he thought we should have told him though it would've made no difference. She had 2 years between diagnosis and death, phones work both ways. He refused to understand I knew so little, had no idea how much time she had left even when it was very clearly winding down and we moved so she could be with family before passing. And now my father and I don't talk. I checked my phone and the last interaction was January 15th 2024.

22234,m6pzsxf,comment,,"I’m so sorry, for everything you have endured. This is honestly… almost incomprehensible. Have you read a book called ‘the shock of the fall’? You might find it relatable. Sometimes I think everyone is too afraid to grab a bull by the horns and grapple with stuff like this head on.

You shouldn’t really hate your brother as much as you hate your parents. They were entirely complicit in your abuse. I don’t think it’s fair for people to be saying “a 6 year old knows right from wrong and so did he” because when someone has severe and complex learning difficulties professionals can only give a ‘best fit’ expectation of their developmental stage. It doesn’t mean he thought in the same way as a neurotypical six year old or that he had the same emotional understanding or regulation… It just means his ability level for things like getting dressed or trying to learn to read was on par with a six year old.

It was up to your parents to try and teach him not to harm you, or to remove him to an appropriate facility if they were unable to keep you safe. They failed you. They were so wrapped up in your brother’s needs and keeping the family reputation that they utterly failed you.

I’m sure a part of you is grappling with some complex questions… like ‘was it accidentally on-purpose that I didn’t tell him the stairs were wet?’ and everyone will tell you that it’s not your fault… because it’s not. They will tell you that accidents happen, because they do. Nobody else is going to be brave enough to say this… Maybe subliminally part of you did *forget* to mention the stairs were wet. Maybe you feel immeasurable guilt because you think part of you did this intentionally. Freud (who was a nutter that wanted to boink his own mother) said there is no such thing as an accident.

But guess what… Even if that is true, it is *still* NOT YOUR FAULT. Even if deep down you know part of you hoped he would slip and fall I’m sure no part of you thought he would die and more importantly - it was an act of self defence. You are not to blame, under any circumstances! You need to be kind to yourself. You have had such an ordeal and the ones responsible here are your parents.

I went through similar emotions with my father when he past as he was also an abuser. Remember be kind and gentle with yourself in this time.

CPS could have found a relative that would be willing to take you in and raise you away from the abuse or they could have found an appropriate special needs care center for him. 

This whole situation was an accident waiting to happen. And that is what his fall was. It was an accident. Given what you said about his balance deteriorating,  he could have fallen even if you didn't mop the stairs, and honestly, the only way the stairs would have remained wet after an hour is if you basically just dumped water on them with no mop.

Your parents let your resentment grow. They knew how he was treating you and told you to keep quiet because they didn't want their image tainted, and that is exactly what would have happened if you went to a responsible adult. Your parents were and are not responsible adults. Responsible adults wouldn't further traumatize their already traumatized child by having them be caretaker to their abuser. Responsible adults would have taught their disabled child boundaries because if he had done this to any other person, it would have been reported immediately and they would have been found negligent to him and to you.

I have a feeling that they only had you so that someone else will be burdened with taking care of him when they were done doing it themselves.

22300,m6u7ax5,comment,,"For me, I basically lost all emotion. I could feel anger or sorrow, but no happiness. I was always keyed up and couldn't relax. I couldn't sleep more than an hour or two at a time, and I always had nightmares. I felt like a robot most of the time. Time itself didn't have much meaning, and the days blended together. I still don't remember that time clearly, to be honest. It just felt like living the same day over and over again. I would go from a deep sleep to wide awake and in a complete panic, my heart pounding, hyperventilating, my hands and feet tingling. I thought I was going to die. Eventually, I hoped I would die.

Even after I put my mother in a post-acute nursing home, I still had symptoms. I was living with my partner, but I still didn't feel happy. I didn't even feel alive, really. I still woke up terrified every morning, feeling like I was missing something important. I would walk out the front door every morning and just stare around, trying to convince myself that the world was real. I would take every shift I could at work because that was the only place I felt halfway normal. I have a high stress, difficult job, but the pressure I was under at work felt like home. On my days off, I drank. Alcohol kept the feelings bubbling under the surface at bay and kept me numb so I could function. I isolated myself from my family and friends. Even from my partner. I would sit in the bedroom alone and watch TV or play video games. I randomly broke down sobbing uncontrollably. Or I would just get angry. An all-consuming rage that would come out of nowhere and last for hours. My partner was afraid of me then, and I almost lost him. Thankfully, he understood and encouraged me to get into therapy.

I've been in therapy for two years now, and I'm finally starting to get back to normal. I can feel happiness again, and I'm looking forward to building a future. I still have nightmares and insomnia, but the periods of depression and anger aren't as severe and don't last as long. I know how to cope with them without drinking.

Talk with a trusted teacher or adult, especially if you’re even remotely close with a friend, as their family may be able to help, even if it’s just making up reasons for you to stay there as much as possible. 

Also, you did NOTHING wrong. You did the cleaning as you were told. It’s not your fault it was still wet an hour later and is not your fault he fell or anything else before or after.

Just because he didn't touch you on your private parts doesn't take away the fact. it's weird. Plus, you were a child. You were going to be affection.

I have kids, not once did I behave that way towards them it's weird. And your mum basically enabled it. Yelling at him but then leaving you both to talk for a few minutes?


Even if he wasn't inappropriately touching you in your sleep, he was probably getting off to you being next to him. Why? Because he needs to be locked up because he's a fucking predator. You also say one night you think you caught his hand leaving your pants. It's not that uncommon for us to black out of forgetting things.  The fact you used to pretend to be asleep because you suspected him of doing that is more than enough. It is NOT normal for children to suspect or think their dad/mom is touching them in their sleep. The kissing whilst your mum was out too? Yeah, just because he didn't go further ≠ he wasn't abusing you. Mum tells him to act on his apology, but even if she is on your side, she still failed to protect you just because she didn’t want to jump to incriminate him either.

Also, as a mother, you say she witnessed the bathroom incident yet doesn't remember? Are you SURE she doesn't actually remember or chooses not to? Because if I caught my husband peering down and looking up at one of our twelve year olds when they are using the toilet. I am going to remember, especially if my child feels unsafe. SOME predators engage in behaviors similar to what your dad does, like lying next to kids, kissing them, or being overly affectionate. While many decent parents act this way, my husband, who works in law enforcement, has in the past when I wanted to learn about safeguarding pointed out that some individuals find ways to get off, for instance, many predators purchase videos from the porn star Belle Delphine, who caters to their interests by dressing and acting like a child. This allows them to indulge their desires since even if they get caught, they can't get arrested because it's not illegal. 

I'm really sorry to hear about what you went through. Your dad's behaviour was and still bloody is completely unacceptable, (even if you don't see it since u clearly still don't think he deserves to be locked up), but there's no reason for you to feel any affection towards him, especially after what he did when your mom wasn't around. Just because you might not remember everything doesn't mean it didn't happen, and on top of that, you STILL felt uncomfortable. His actions, like looking at you while you were using the toilet, are just creepy and show he had inappropriate intentions. Even if he didn't act any further, it's still perverted and although I'm not blaming your mum completely, she still when it happened before she 'forgot' should have made SURE he respected boundaries because he would have been reported and kicked out of the house if you was my child. No child should have ever, EVER gone through that or have to fake being asleep because they know their dads a creep but want confirmation. And I'll say it again, just because you never caught him/it didn't go further than the kiss it was still to him clearly sexual and twisted pleasure. Taking you in the office-bedroom after he kissed you whilst you were out is just as clear as day. Get the fuck out and cut that perv out of your life, because your stuck in a cycle.

I think the memories surface when your mind secretly knows you’re capable of confronting them. 

Incest is such a taboo still that it is rarely spoken of and it makes it harder to recognize even when you yourself have experienced it; your mind hides it from you. No one validates it as reality. And when it is a parent whom you depend on for survival, and the other parent is colluding, consciously or not, in concealing it, there is nowhere to turn, and so you turn in on yourself. 

I do think there’s value in uncovering it. I was able to protect my daughters from my father. I also spoke very publicly about my abuse for the first time a few years ago online, openly, the whole story. Many family members disowned me. (My father was already dead at that point; mom is still alive).

22453,m6qhwt5,comment,,"That’s an awful lot of assumptions and pandering to emotions...all to justify an objectively stupid thing to do. I have placed a shotgun in my mouth and pulled the trigger while I was in a parking garage close to the beach. The primer was struck but nothing ignited, probably because the ammo was stored in the car for 1-3 days? (that’s my memento from the incident btw). So yes, I’ve gone through this dramatic boo-hoo stuff you thought would make me back away.

I certainly did not drive to a bridge and throw the shotgun into a river or the ocean. I moved out of state about 6 months year later and called the non-emergency police line about surrendering a gun. It is remarkably stupid to hide a gun (registered to you) in a public location and simply hope nobody finds it over the years. It’s not unusual for magnet fishers to find guns thrown off bridges/in rivers. Look it up on YouTube if you don’t believe me.

Now for the “something needs to be lost immediately because it’s a now or never” argument. Throw the ammo in the water, genius. If you’re in a clear enough mindset that you recognize the means to commit suicide needs to be removed from you, do what’s responsible and covers your ass later. It has the same effect and you aren’t willingly losing something that is registered to your name. A gun is useless without ammo, and ammo isn’t serialized and registered to your name. 

Have a paper trail on where a gun goes, because what you’re proposing people do is contributing to “illegal gunz on the streetz”. In states like California, you get in legal trouble for not reporting when a firearm is missing or stolen. And good luck if you want to the cops after the fact and tell them “hey guys, I threw my gun into the river because I knew I was a danger to myself or others lol, didn’t bother calling 9-1-1, even though that’s the advice that pops up everywhere, because I thought I could and should deal with it on my own. But good luck finding it!”"," That’s an awful lot of assumptions and pandering to emotions...all to justify an objectively stupid thing to do. I have placed a shotgun in my mouth and pulled the trigger while I was in a parking garage close to the beach. The primer was struck but nothing ignited, probably because the ammo was stored in the car for 1-3 days? (that’s my memento from the incident btw). So yes, I’ve gone through this dramatic boo-hoo stuff you thought would make me back away.

I certainly did not drive to a bridge and throw the shotgun into a river or the ocean. I moved out of state about 6 months year later and called the non-emergency police line about surrendering a gun. It is remarkably stupid to hide a gun (registered to you) in a public location and simply hope nobody finds it over the years.

If OP has no suicidal ideations at this time, and furthermore, was trying to escape a point in his life he felt he was trapped in and had no other option, maybe he can keep the gun for protection, instead of suicide.

at the end of the day, pain and evil are almost always inextricable. being a victim is no excuse for hurting other people when you were old enough to know better. but i'd challenge you to extend your past self the same grace you think others at your same age and circumstances deserve. you feel that disgust and shame when you think of the hurt you caused because you have the strength to grow. it takes emotional honesty and honor to reflect on your own actions, realize, and accept that you fucked up.

yeah maybe some of it was your fault, but - and i know a bunch of crypto-calvinists wouldn't agree with me but i stand by this - the fact that you wouldn't have done it if your own circumstances had been kind and fair and accountable *does* matter. it does. more importantly, all of us are just trying to be better tomorrow than we were today. that's literally all we can do. you have to find a way to replace the screen time that brave part of you knew you needed to get away from with something meaningful and positive and try to be your best self.

one thing i'll add is that your post made me wonder if there isn't maybe something deeper going on. i'm not a clinician and am not trying to be presumptuous but your thinking patterns remind me a bit of [scrupulosity](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18226490/) and/or PTSD. it may be worth talking to a good healthcare provider (especially a good psychiatrist if possible) about what's going on.

First you need to know you did nothing to deserve the betrayal you have experienced. Not all people have the character flaw to crap all over their loved ones. You seem to have had a lot like that in your life. 

So what is the best way to move forward and lift something off your chest? 
1. Stop dwelling in/on the past. You cannot move forward with one foot and your head stuck in the past. Take notes on all the crap that bothers you, literally. Then bury or burn the notes. This gets you out of the past. Move forward and keep your eyes on goals for yourself. 

2. Choose who you want in your life going forward. You cannot choose family. But you can choose who you want to spend your time and energy with. Subtract the energy vampires. The soul suckers need to be gone, or at least limited. 
This removes their ability to drag you down into their drama and BS. 

3.  Use the great Doctor Phil as a guide. Be brutally honest with yourself at all times. BRUTALLY! 
Ask yourself ""how is THAT working out for you?"" If the answer is negatively, change whatever THAT is. 

Finally constantly remind yourself not to keep living in the past, let that crap go. What you have learned is that some people have serious character flaws and treat others badly, which is how not to be a decent human.

I am so sorry this happened to you and it can be really hard to heal from trauma, it is especially difficult when it is related to sexual assault and abuse.
Please care for yourself and therapy sometimes can be helpful.

When I go to parties I get slightly buzzed to relieve the social anxiety of talking to other people.

You need better boundaries and rules for yourself.

&#x200B;

Also stop stressing about grabbing a girls boob when you were 15. You were drunk, they were drunk, its a weird gray area ( WHICH IS WHY YOU SHOULD STOP GETTING CRAZY DRUNK AT PARTIES). Also you were kissing, so it is not like you came onto a girl that had no idea you were sexually interested. Like I said, gray area.

Honestly you do yourself more harm by fixating on a maybe sexual assault when you were 15. Just dont sexually assault people NOW and also stop getting so drunk and you won't have to worry anymore."," Stop getting super drunk in places with strangers / people you dont trust?

It threw me off for years, making me question everything I did in other relationships. I realized after some time, that he didn’t always ask me if I wanted to be intimate and there was an “assumption” if you will that things were going to happen when we got together.

22613,efqvkv4,comment,,"Give her space and be compassionate. A lot of young women struggle with asserting their boundaries and with feeling guilty/dirty around anything related to sex. For example, the first time I took my shirt off while making out with my boyfriend (I was a junior in high school), I cried for hours afterward and didn’t want to be around him for a long time. He had been pushy, but didn’t do anything illegal or horrible. I just felt really slutty and ashamed of not asserting my boundaries.

It sounds like your gf is going through something similar. If you start seeing each other again, one way to prevent this feeling on her part in the future is (a) introduce her to feminist magazines that are sex positive (I highly recommend Rookie mag, which is online but published a ‘yearbook’ collection annually), and more importantly, (b) try defaulting to a model of consent where “no” is the assumed default and you ask verbally before doing anything, say, involving her chest or her groin. 

Finally, while you shouldn’t have assumed that your gf was moving your hand to her crotch, what you did is not tantamount to assault. Your gf couldn’t press assault charges if she told the truth about what happened, b/c what happened doesn’t qualify as assault in any shape, form, or fashion. If your gf believes you assaulted her, it is worth gently trying to bring this up. If you do that though, you will want to be very careful to still recognize the ways you went wrong (ex: “I know that I made you feel very uncomfortable and I think your feelings are valid and legitimate. However, what I did was not tantamount sexual assault or anything illegal. With that said, I know now that I shouldn’t have assumed what I did, and I feel terrible that I made you feel uncomfortable. In the future, I want to try to be more careful and attentive to what you might be feeling.”).

Sometimes we can f**k up without doing anything illegal. Being pushy/presumptive in a sexual context is one way we can do that.

Respect your friend's boundaries and give her space, and just try not to get yourself in that kind of situation again. Sexual assault is a horrible thing, and although what you did was pretty light, it can still be traumatizing. I am glad that you understood that what you did was wrong, as we need more people to understand that women don't feel safe in general, but remember, you can prevent this from happening again, and you can prevent it from happening to others. Remember how toy feel now a d you'll have the confidence to help out someone in this situation in the future. "," The important thing is that you feel remorse.

22636,e8mxlmx,comment,,"For what it's worth, I think /u/positivemantra is right. I didn't really respect boundaries after they'd been made clear. I get this is a spectrum and what I did is by no means the heavier side of it, but it clearly hurt my friend a lot. I think it's the letting her down that sucks the most, no? She's cool. I shouldn't have done that. I guess I just feel really bad about this, and a non-consensual advance and/or contact does fall under the definition of sexual assault. This is just part of who I am now, right? I have done that. I need to not do that in future, and I need to learn to live with this somehow.

Though for clarity, I am not a heavy/regular drinker. I just happened to be very drunk that night. I will stop drinking, irrespective of your comment tho. Though to refute something, I have made it clear in my post that I made no excuse whatsoever for my behaviour. I was drunk, that was just part of the story. Not an excuse.

Thanks for engaging. Really appreciate it. Just spilling my brain out here is helping me process it."," For what it's worth, I think /u/positivemantra is right.

22637,e7p74fh,comment,,"Is it still considered sexual assault if the act is done by 8 year olds who most likely have no idea what they are actually doing? I’m legitimately unsure. Can 8 year olds even get charged for such an act, could they get into trouble as adults now for what they did back then? I’d imagine if anything it would be their parents who would get into trouble because why else would an 8 year old do such a thing unless the parents of the child have done something they shouldn’t have to that same child."," Is it still considered sexual assault if the act is done by 8 year olds who most likely have no idea what they are actually doing?

22638,e7pr1za,comment,,"According to the law, it likely counts as sexual assault; however, it's unlikely the police would get involved unless there were injuries or it happens multiple times. Additionally, children are charged under a different set of laws so would probably go to juvie at the worst or have required therapy and a behavioral management plan for school.


The children probably don't fully understand the ramifications of what they're doing (that it is *sexual* assault), but probably know that it's wrong (assuming they were not abused themselves). 

I've worked with a lot children (infanta to 6 years mostly) and they can definitely be taught that touching people without consent in general is bad. Teaching children to respect others' space and physical being is incredibly important and some children aren't taught this unfortunately (and some have gone through events making it very difficult to understand why it's NOT okay to touch or hurt others).

22641,e7kqm7v,comment,,"Glad to see this, I feel the same way. Sexual assault should of course be prosecuted and investigated, but I think unfortunately too many other victims immediately assumed he was guilty because the accusations were similar to their experiences. Hopefully the result of this is that women are more motivated to  bring their cases up right after an assault, when it's easier to nail the guy who did it with evidence. What's brutal about the Kavanaugh case is that there was never going to be a way to definitively prove/disprove what happened; 40 years is just too long to wait.

14097.0,1hrct01,post,the police has failed me and i feel exhausted ,"the uk police has failed me and i feel disappointed in them. i feel too high for this 
and want to scream and cry

i don’t know what to do anymore and i feel exhausted , i knew my ex was going to pull this bullshit off and warned the police 

for context: over a year ago, my ex (mtf), violated my body or in other words raped me. i was forgiving towards that and my ex is overall a shitty person to me, i confided in her stepmum because i wanted to let someone know.

i am not close with my family and my friends are always busy, so i don’t have a support system.

just because i told my ex’s stepmum about my assault and she told me ex and the police was called on me about that. i told my ex’s stepmum in november and she very much invalidated me

i’m very much confused. this was like a 2 months ago, i told my ex’s stepmum on how i got sexually assaulted and she invalidated me. with my ex (mtf), i have had no contact with for 4/5 months to my ex. i told my ex’s stepmum because she wanted me to go to the police and tell them, the police didn’t help me

i updated her on the police (the last time which was 2 months ago) and how they failed me. just a few days, the police knocked on me door. they said to me “don’t talk to you ex again”, like i don’t at all for months and been living my life in peace

my ex made a police report for no reason and for the police to show up at my door. they took my ex, more seriously than my sexual assault case. i’m beyond exhausted of this all of this and i’ve explaining to the police 

is life worth living because it doesn’t seem like it and it would make my ex happy if i was dead.

i had to tell someone and wish i was dead too because i’m tired of this","the police has failed me and i feel exhausted  the uk police has failed me and i feel disappointed in them. i feel too high for this

14109.0,1hrdmgp,post,I was sexually assaulted and I don't feel anything,"Few days ago I (20 F) was sexually assaulted by my cousin (22 M) while I was sleeping. Around 3 am I woke from sleep and I could feel that he was touching me, but my body froze and I couldn't do anything. I made some noise thinking he would back away but he didn't budge. Then he started fingering me and after few minutes I moved the hand away and told him to stop. I ran from the room and all I could feel was pain physically not emotionally. 
Later he told that he thought I was awake and I wanted it. Even though I was awake I didn't want it but I told him I wasn't awake and I never wanted it. He was guilty and asked for forgiveness. And I told it's okay and didn't want to continue the conversation. 

Next day, I continued with my daily routine but I just didn't want to interact nor talk to my cousin. 

It's been few days and I still find it hard to talk to him, but other than that I don't feel anything. I don't think I feel sad, or hurt emotionally. I just want to continue with my old life and old self. 

Is this normal?
Or could it be that subconsciously I feel guilty was not stopping him early?

That they were just my older cousin being friendly or something. I just need an explanation that wasn’t that. I was sharing an air mattress with my older cousin and his gf who I’m friends with for a New Year’s party we were at. The way we were laying, his girlfriend was in between us. It started with just holding my hand, then moving to putting his hand on my stomach. We’ve grown up close and I assumed he was asleep so he didn’t even realize what he was doing. He slowly started to move his hand higher up my chest until he was just below my breast. I was only a little nervous at this point. Surely this isn’t anything crazy. Just my older cousin being friendly. I mean his girlfriend was laying in between us and for fucks sake, he’s my older cousin. Older cousins don’t do that, right? My breathing quickened from a slow inhalation to hitched, fast breaths. He started to move his hand to the waistband of my pants, innocent enough. Then he began to dip his fingers below the band and into my pants. I can’t even describe with words the emotions I felt when he reached my underwear and started to dip his fingers beneath that band as well. I just let a small tear roll down my face. I was so confused and scared that I just froze. In a small attempt to come to terms with my reality, I tried to stop his hand from going any lower. But then, he began to rub overtop of my underwear. How do I tell anyone about this? I’m so scared, confused, and embarrassed. I don’t know what that was because he then left like nothing was wrong with his gf 10 minutes after he finally stopped. Every time I close my eyes I think about it and I just want to cry. 

Does this mean I cheated on my boyfriend? I don’t want him to think I would ever do something like that so I can’t even tell him.  And how do I say anything to his gf?

I love my sister very much and i’d never hurt her and i want nothing but to protect her. But given we have the same age gap as me and my assaulter did I think it’s a bit triggering to me, and i don’t know who to talk to about it.

I get really awful intrusive thoughts sometimes that I know i don’t feel nor would act on. And it makes me feel disgusted that I sometimes feel guilty or ashamed or like my destiny is to be like my assaulter. I don’t know why this is so suddenly all coming up for me.

14132.0,1hrgtlb,post,Were any of these rape or SA?,"When I was 18, I was drugged ( Rohypnol possibly, given it's effects and acting speed ) and was unconscious for about 5 hours, I don't think anything happened out of the ordinary, but there's still the thought of 'what if?' .  I was really sexually active at the time so it might be hard to tell. 

When I was 24, I was with my soon to be first wife. She was an alcoholic and drank almost every night to the point of blackout. She already knew about me being bisexual at the time along with my fascination with dressing like a woman. She also attended a gym and would bench 300 pounds like it was nothing, so she was very strong....a lot stronger than any man I knew at the time. On this particular night, she was drinking again and was very emotional. I was dressed in my usual at the time, a t-shirt and boxers. We had gotten into an argument and it became more heated and heated as the night went on. Later that night, I went to use the bathroom. She was yelling at me about how I'll probably leave her for some man since I'd always wanted to receive anal from her and never wanting to go down on her and suffering from ED all the time. Proclaiming that I was gay and not bisexual like I said before the relationship started at 21. When I was coming out of the bathroom, she blocked me off and started charging after me like she wanted to fight ( she had a history of fighting me and she punched like a brick wall ). I climbed over the bed to try and get around her to get away. During which with one hand she grabbed the back of my shirt, keeping me from getting away no matter how hard I tried; and the other hand yanking down my boxers and jabbing her fingernails into my asshole to the point of me bleeding. All the while, yelling at me about how I love getting it in the ass and that's all I want. Yelling at me in a question form, "" you love that Bitch, don't ya', don't ya'? Yeah, you're just a Bitch ass faggot!"". When I finally got away, I pulled up my boxers, grabbed my keys off the wall, ran out the front door, got in my truck and drove off. I was crying the whole time from the pain. Later that night, I came back to find her passed out on the bed. I carefully got into bed, so not to wake her, and went to sleep. The next morning when I woke up, she greeted me cheerfully with the usual,  ""good morning honeybun!"" with a big smile on her face. I kinda looked at her sideways with a puzzled look on my face. ""You don't remember what happened last night, do you?"" She said she didn't besides drinking a little and apparently going to bed. She asked why. I explained everything that happened. She was mortified, she broke down crying, Proclaiming she was a monster and should be put in prison or put to death. Not knowing how she could've done that to me. I tried comforting her, telling her it's OK, she didn't remember, she didn't know and that I still loved her and wanted to be with her. 

When I was 28, I was a widower and trying to pursue transition. I would frequent the gay bars, hooking up with random guys. I met one guy who had a BBC. I've never had one before and wanted him to be my first. We went to his place after a few drinks. After some small talk, we got naked and got into bed. He had me blow him and I thought 'shit, he's huge and he's soft'. After I got him hard, he was about 11"" long and about 2 1/2"" wide. He asked me how I wanted it, I decided doggy style to give myself the best opportunity to take that monster cock. He put some lube on it and in my ass, told me to grab the pillow, put his hand between my shoulder blades, got up on one leg and proceeded to go in. It hurt like hell and I changed my mind. I told him to stop and pull out, that I'm not ready, it's too much. He told me ""just stay there, you wanted this Bitch, you begged and begged all night even though I warned you and didn't want to do it.  Now you're going to take it whether you like it or not. "" He held me down and I couldn't get up.  The pain didn't seem to go away, it just hurt the whole time and he started going faster and faster. I was clinching into the pillow, hugging it into my face, crying from the pain and just wanting it to stop. Eventually, he finally finished, cumming into my ass and thrusting harder than ever. Afterwards he got off the bed, ordered me on my knees in front of him and to suck his cock. I told him I wasn't into ass to mouth. He yelled at me ""suck it Bitch, suck your ass juices off my dick, clean it Bitch, don't make me tell you again or you're not going to like it!"" I reluctantly took his dick into my mouth, it smelled so bad. He yelled ""suck it Bitch, clean that shit up, make it nice and clean!"" He started thrusting and hit my gag reflex. I started to pull away and he grabbed me by my hair and made me gag on it. When he was finally finished, he got into bed. I was exhausted and got into bed, thinking to myself, I did ask for it, we were drinking, he was just really horny, he didn't know I really wanted to stop, he was just in the mood and really got into it. I closed my eyes and went to bed. I woke up to him lifting my ass up until my legs fell underneath and ramming his cock into my ass. I screamed and cried, begging him to stop, but it never stopped. He just said ""Bitch, you got me so fucking horny! See what you fucking did?"". After he finished and came in my ass again, I was even more tired than before and just wanted to sleep so bad. I pulled to covers over me and went to bed. I woke up to the same thing, crying and begging. When he finished, I just went to sleep. This went on and on through the night, eventually I was too tired to scream, cry or beg. Eventually it started feeling better to where I was liking it. When morning came, I was tired, extremely horny and wanting to be his sex slave. I was hooked on his dick, it was all I thought about minus the pain in my ass with every step I took. 

When I was 39, about 1 1/2 years into my transition, I hit hard times. Unable to find a job in the market. I was an electrician working on construction sites when my job finished and couldn't find another one due to the season change. I was living on what I had saved for food, rent and utilities.  I also started partying with meth and coke, often doing pnp so I didn't have to pay for it. I also befriended someone whom I thought was trans who I was getting intimate with and befriended two other people needing a place to stay who offered to keep me in constant supply for meth. I went with my 'trans' friend to a place called Joe's Addiction, a coffee shop in Valley Brook, where the homeless could get some clothes and something to eat. I had been living full time for about as long. I was wearing a black spaghetti strap top that made my breast look nice, and a black jean skirt that rode just below my knees and some black flats. After gathering some clothes and eating a nice meal, I decided to hang out outside and enjoy the nice weather. The sun was out, it was warm and I was feeling really happy, just living my life in my preferred gender. Outside, I was walking around, hips naturally swaying, nails painted a nice sexy deep red, puffing my vape with some nice big clouds. I felt so beautiful and attractive, just living 'the life'. I saw a dark skinned Latino, fairly attractive, smiling at me and motioning me to follow him. I thought, cool, someone nice wanting to talk to me. We were walking out back, making small talk here and there, he seemed really nice. I wasn't horny at the time due to current stresses in life and being somewhere I wasn't too familiar with or comfortable with, but it was nice having someone I could talk to. After a while, he kept changing directions and the grass was getting taller and taller. I kept asking where we were going to, he didn't answer, I thought maybe he didn't hear me or something. He just kept walking, going faster and faster. I almost had to run to keep up. I kept saying wait, wait; but I guess he didn't hear me or something. Eventually we got to a large clearing, I could barely make out the top of the building. I felt absolutely alone and kinda lost, besides him being there. He sat down and offered me to sit by him, I thought maybe he wanted some privacy and not comfortable with talking to a trans person with people around, being that we weren't in the gay district of the city. We started talking again, soon he started rubbing my back. I thought 'he's getting a little touchy, maybe it's his first time with a girl like me, maybe he doesn't know how to talk to a girl like me"". Soon he pulls up my skirt and grabs me down there kinda hard, then switching to my breast squeezing hard, pulls his dick out wish was hard and putting my hand on his dick, then switching back under my skirt, then my breast. He was squeezing so hard, he kinda pushed me onto my back. I felt really uncomfortable and went to get up, during which with one hand, slams me back down on the ground hard and my head hit the ground, it hurt. While pinning me down with one hand, gets even rougher with me down there and yanking my panties down hard, ripping them in the process, then switching to my breast squeezing and ripping my top. Everything hurt, nothing felt good, I just laid there quiet. I think I was too scared to do anything or scream, out of fear and sheer terror of what he might do to me if I alerted anyone. I felt so alone, so vulnerable, so helpless, just hoping he would finish, hoping he wouldn't kill me, hoping I would come out alive, it felt like an  eternity........... finally........ he stopped, kept saying sorry, sorry.                 I quietly put my clothes back on, still shaken and scared from what just happened, I was still scared he might kill me if anyone was alerted, being that I didn't see or hear anyone around. He left and soon I did too, being sure to keep a large distance between us, by the time I got back home, I was still shaken and scared

Lay down in a dimly lit or dark place where you are comfortable. You can use an eye mask if you have one, as well as a weighted blanket. If you don’t have those things, just use a regular blanket and make sure the room is dark and your eyes are closed. Keep your arms by your sides.

Lay down in a dimly lit or dark place where you are comfortable. You can use an eye mask if you have one, as well as a weighted blanket. If you don’t have those things, just use a regular blanket and make sure the room is dark and your eyes are closed. Keep your arms by your sides.

14153.0,1hri94m,post,I think something happened but I think I gave consent,"I flagged this as a rant because I don’t think I’m ready to hear wether or not it was assault. This is a description of what happened to me, I’ve read the rules and I think it’s ok but I’m sorry if it’s not.

I was with my boyfriend today at his parents house. We haven’t had sex in probably a year or more, because I don’t want to and I’ve been trying to find out wether I’m asexual, have sexual trauma or wether it’s a hormonal issue.

I was wearing a backless top and he kept rubbing my back. I was uncomfortable but didn’t say anything because he usually complains that I act like everything he does is sexual. At some point, he asked me about how’s therapy going, since I started going to see about this sexual issue. I told him that we hadn’t made much progress but that we found out I most likely had never been assaulted. We changed subject. A while after, we were kissing in his bed (again, I wasn’t the most comfortable about it, but I didn’t want to start a fight) and he asked if I was okay with us having sex again. I said I was ok but that I didn’t want it today, specially since I currently have a very painful uti and am under a lot of medication. He nodded but a while later said we didn’t have to do penetration. I said no again. We went on to do other things and then after some time we kissed again and he stopped to ask if I still didn’t want it. I said no and that it was hard to have any sexual desire while in pain. I suggested we watch tv instead and he agreed.

A few episodes into the show we were watching, he asked if he could masturbate next to me and said I don’t have to do anything. He didn’t use this words though and I mistakenly thought he was asking to just hold my breasts while we were watching tv and hesitated but said it was ok if it made him happy. I just asked to take my pain medication first and I did so in front of him. I then realized what he had actually asked for but was reluctant to say no. He asked for consent multiple times before starting and I kept saying yes. And then he started doing it while I tried to just focus on the tv. It wasn’t that bad but then he wanted to kiss me while doing it  and also wanted my arm on his chest and kept rubbing my back. He kept asking for consent the whole time and kept saying he could stop if I wanted him to. I’d take a while to answer but said yes to all of his questions. He thanked me after everything was over and now I hate myself for saying yes all of those times because I feel like I was denying myself a chance to stop it. I don’t even know if it’s assault because I technically consented and I also technically didnt do anything, like he said. I didn’t want my year to start like that I’m heartbroken.

14154.0,1hri9aj,post,How do I deal with this,"I (23f) was sexually assaulted early hours New Year’s Day while drunk by a friend (22m) I’ve known for 6 years and I don’t know how to deal with it. 

We’d been out for new years and went back to his uncles party, at the end of the night we were sat in the garage while I had a cigarette when he came onto me and started trying to kiss me and asked if I wanted to have sex, I said no and to stop as I had a boyfriend which he knew as he was also friends with my boyfriend. He kept pushing and pushing and said if I wouldn’t sleep with him I could at least give him a blow job, I said no again which is when he grabbed my hair and shoved it in my mouth while saying he wanted me to do what I do for my bf. It lasted a few minutes before his sister nocked on the door which is when he stopped. 

Today he messaged me saying he didn’t know what happened the night before and was sorry if he’d over stepped, he also messaged my bf to apologise to him as well. I ignored him and my boyfriend told him he’d over stepped but I hadn’t told him he forced it in my mouth at the time because I couldn’t find the words so I’d just told him he’d came onto me. My boyfriend is a very intimidating man to everyone but me and while he’s never been violent with me (complete softy with me and around me) he’s got a past and I was scared of the fall out as I didn’t want him to hurt the friend but a few hours later I broke down and told him everything. I also messaged the friend back and told him and he denied it saying he remembers coming onto me and kissing me but he’d never do that. He eventually apologised and kept messaging saying he was shocked and he’s never done something like that and can’t believe he did. He’s asked to meet in person to talk about it and wants everything to go back to normal and be friends again I told him straight up I could never do that now. My bf is furious with himself and blames himself as he encouraged me to go out with the friend because he was at work and didn’t want me to be alone on New Year’s Eve, he trusted the friend to look after me and keep me safe. 

I just don’t know what to do going forward I’ve spent all day in bed crying and I keep getting flash backs, I feel sick and like I can’t get my mouth clean enough. How do I move on from this? I know with time it’ll get better but I can’t sleep because every time I close my eyes I get flash backs. I can’t get the feeling out my mouth which makes me feel even more sick. I feel so violated and dirty. I’m going to look into therapy but the nhs waiting lists are months long and I don’t know if I can hold on that long.

14161.0,1hrikfl,post,I'm being SA'd by my step-dad,"My(18 F) step-dad, (41M) has been touching me in my sleep for over a year now. My dad has never really been in my life. Our relationship has been basically non-existent, only pops up when I do well in life. I was born and raised in my grandparents house, with my mom, until maybe 6 when my mom met my step-dad. She had me young, 20. My step-dad also has a daughter who was my age. My step-dad, let's call him M. M and I didn't have the best relationship when I was younger. He was really mean and used to yell at me a lot. M and my mom would fight a lot in their early twenties, some even physical, and I would be woken up in the middle of my sleep to them almost killing each other. My grandmother was my safe space, she liked to gossip, bad-mouth people, but she was my grandmother. She lived like 2 minutes away from us, so anything that occurred at home, I would call her.

Anyways, when I was around 13, I called my father for something and he yelled at me on the phone. I've been yelled at many times in my life. Some way worse than that, but something about his audacity really hurt me. I cried. A lot. From that moment on, me and M's relationship got a bit better. I guess he felt bad for me and tried to be the father figure instead of my dad. He would make jokes with me, play fight a few times. 

When quarantine started, I realized that when we would playfight, he would do weird things. At first, he would slap me on my butt. Please keep in mind that I never had a father figure, atleast not one that I was super close to, so I wasn't used to the father-daughter dynamics, hence I brushed it off as something normal, though I didn't like it.

Then, he started to pull my pants a bit and then spank me. I knew something was wrong there. I asked two friends about it, if it were normal and they immediately told me no. Questioned me about it and I got scared. When they asked later on, I lied and told them he stopped. He never showed any signs of lust or anything inappropriate otherwise so I deluded myself into thinking it was probably just him trying to bond with me. After a while it stopped I think.

Then came the inappropriate talks. All of it was so subtle and he would pass it off as advice, like the grooming of my private parts and how to do it and how my body looked etc.

By the time I was seventeen, we had a strong relationship I guess. I was desperate for a father-daughter one. My grandmother was sick, close to dying. He would leave the house at 5 am, the time that I wake up for school, so most, if not every morning, he would come and tell me goodbye and probably leave instructions for me to do, however I'm a heavy sleeper and I'm always in a haze whenever he wakes me up that I barely ever remember if he talks to me. We would laugh it off and he would always sound amazed at how much of a heavy sleeper I am.

One day in August I think, 2023, I was asleep and I felt my sheet being slowly pulled away. I was hazy and it was a year ago, so I don’t know if he touched my underwear this time. By the time I was getting up, I heard movement, then I saw his hand hit the light switch to turn it off and I heard him run off. Long story short, it happened multiple times, went on to late or middle September I think. I would feel pressure against my vagina, through my underwear, his fingers I think. I tried locking my door, but my mom used to get angry at me for locking it at night. Every time I would begin to wake up, he would immediately run off. One time I think I shut up, stared at him in the eyes and closed back my eyes because I was hazy and scared. He never got to touching my actual private part. 

October 2023, I think, was when I finally broke. I had a hatred building up for him. I was lashing out at my little brother and I didn't want to spend time with anyone. There was something he yelled at me for and I think I answered with some bad attitude. My mother scolded me about it and that I should have respect for him. I think I yelled, ""how can I have respect for him if he touches me"" or something like that. She demanded I told her what happened and I did. I left, and she called him and asked him about it. That mf denied. Said he didn't know what I was talking about. But like a true manipulator, he told me that if I believed that that's what he did then I can call the police and we would be arrested. I was 17 at the time so of course it would have been a crime. Thing is, though, my school work was the most important for me. I had to get my education and graduate, it was only escape. If I told the police, things would be way more complicated. Me, my brother (his son) and my mom were living in his house. If I reported it, I would miss school and be even more distracted and I was scared that I would do terribly in my exams and I won't have a way out. I also felt like I would be ruining my brother's life and he'd be fatherless like me and I feel like my mom never believed me and she would hate me. So I chose not to report it.
Do you know what they did? My mom and M tried to convince me that it was spirits. Spirits that were touching me. My own mother...
Do you know her reason? I never actually saw him touching me, just his hand. And when I looked at him that one time, he wasn't touching me. Which was true, I woke up when the sheet was moving. I decided from then I had to play along because I still had a year of school left. My grandmother died the December.

This stuff isn't like the movies. Or atleast what I thought it was going to be like. I didn't recoil from everyone's touch, I didn't get nightmares. I even questioned if I was truly assaulted. Worst of all, I began to forget. I started looking at him the way I did when I considered him my father. He never touched me for a year. A year things were normal and I forgot. Then it happen again. October 2024. I didn't know what to do. I came home acting weird and like the hypocrite he is, acted concerned when my mother pointed out that something was off. It didn't happen for more than a week again I think and I started to second guess myself until it happened some more times. It affected me so much but I had to hide it. What other choice did I have? I was 18 now and no one would believe me because I didn't say anything the first time and I'm still dependant on him. I started getting suicidal thoughts. I think I actually planned it, but I got cold feet. Any time he would yell at me or get me angry, it was at the tip of my tongue, to tell him about it, or the impulse to do something bad to myself or him. I think it stopped after late November. I'm ashamed to say I sometimes forget about it. I guess it's my way of trying to act like everything is normal. But the minute he gets me angry it's the first thing I remember and those feelings come back. I'm scared that he might do it again and I'll say something, or worse, do something to him or myself.

Please advise me on what to do. The only people that know are my mom, M and my ex-best friend. I can't tell anyone but it eats me alive. 

I also feel like it could be worse, you know? I mean I haven't been r@ped. I also feel guilty because aside from that, my mother has sacrificed so much for me and I may not be rich, but I still have food, a shelter and clothes to wear and there are a lot of things I don't have to be worried about. I feel like if I speak out, I'll be labeled as the ungrateful daughter because nothing really happened to me.

Worst of all, I began to forget. I started looking at him the way I did when I considered him my father. He never touched me for a year. A year things were normal and I forgot. Then it happen again. October 2024. I didn't know what to do. I came home acting weird and like the hypocrite he is, acted concerned when my mother pointed out that something was off. It didn't happen for more than a week again I think and I started to second guess myself until it happened some more times. It affected me so much but I had to hide it. What other choice did I have? I was 18 now and no one would believe me because I didn't say anything the first time and I'm still dependant on him. I started getting suicidal thoughts. I think I actually planned it, but I got cold feet. Any time he would yell at me or get me angry, it was at the tip of my tongue, to tell him about it, or the impulse to do something bad to myself or him. I think it stopped after late November. I'm ashamed to say I sometimes forget about it. I guess it's my way of trying to act like everything is normal. But the minute he gets me angry it's the first thing I remember and those feelings come back. I'm scared that he might do it again and I'll say something, or worse, do something to him or myself.

Please advise me on what to do. The only people that know are my mom, M and my ex-best friend. I can't tell anyone but it eats me alive. 

I also feel like it could be worse, you know? I mean I haven't been r@ped. I also feel guilty because aside from that, my mother has sacrificed so much for me and I may not be rich, but I still have food, a shelter and clothes to wear and there are a lot of things I don't have to be worried about. I feel like if I speak out, I'll be labeled as the ungrateful daughter because nothing really happened to me.

My story is a little different but I feel similarly. Mine was over 18 years ago, and I had never acknowledged it as rape and never told anyone. I had completely buried it. I saw the guy and was near him this summer, and I felt so uncomfortable but couldn’t figure out why. After that I spent months thinking of him constantly. It started out quieter but by August (I saw him in June) he was taking up most of my thoughts and I was changing rapidly. I even told my husband I wasn’t sure I wanted to be married anymore. I was losing it, and didn’t even make the connection to my intrusive thoughts and still hadn’t gotten to the bad memory. Finally in late august I started getting into it. The emotions came first for weeks, then the flashbacks, extreme dissociation and anxiety. It took at least 6 weeks, probably more like 8, to put the memory together. During this time my best friend had said she thought I had PTSD. Then when researching that, I found rape trauma syndrome and realized I had nearly all the symptoms. That’s how I put together that he had raped me. It was fucking wild and SO UNFAIR. It tore my whole life apart and nearly cost me my marriage and family. It’s so so fucked up. And this happened so long ago. Trauma has no timeline unfortunately and we deal with it when and how we do. I know that I have lots more support now than I would have if I had told someone about it and put the traumatic memory together back then; I keep trying to frame it that way because I wish now that I had dealt with it then, of course.

Anyway yeah I wish I could move on too. Especially since it seems like I moved on without missing a beat all that time ago. But the truth was I buried it and never healed it. I’m happy for you that you’re doing the healing work now. Breathwork has helped me too. Also just be really gentle with yourself.

I thought he meant abuse but the realization hit he ment rape. and things of that sort. I broke up with him after seeing his weird comments on theese young girls tik tok pages. and that's when I started doing research. I texted his old gf and old friends and found out he admitted to so many things. including beastiality stuff, being into kids,into rape and much more. 
I told his sibling whom I was close with and I guess word got around to his parents. and after only being angry at him nothing else happened. the sibling told me to stop talking to them about that and shut it out. I called his mom and told him he did stuff with me unconsentually. and never heard much about that. 
I tried talking to the campus police where he went but it didn't do anything.

fast forward 2 years. I'm 19 and found out my ex now goes to the same college as one of my friends.there in the same dorm hall, they have told me how uncomfortable that he has made them even going as far to ask to watch them have sex, watching corn in the dorm rooms while the other dorm mate is there and much more. 
he's still hurting other people and still getting away with it. I know something deeper is going on here. I don't know what to do. what do I do. I need advice please. thank you

He's doing every play in the book.",2.0,,2025-01-02 4:32,t3_1hrikfl,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hrikfl/im_being_sad_by_my_stepdad/m4ynccm/,Neutral

He was 21 and I was 17 and we had hung out a few times and talked over the phone a lot and one time when he came over, we were in my room and he keeps groping me and pushing for sex and I kept saying no and he just kept going. eventually pulling my shorts down and raping me. then moving away soon after. and literally every night since I’ve felt unsafe in my own bed I feel so violated even still. If I hear any talk about him from my family or if my brothers joke about how much of an ass he was I just wanna barf. And cringe so hard it hurts. Because no one knows. They all joke about how our relationship was unstable and how they didn’t like him. my brother made a joke about STDs one time and directed it at me saying “he probably had something” and that “I doge a bullet”. And I wanted to die. And still do. I constantly feel dirty just remembering his touch, his smell, his face. I just feel grimy.

The villa you have two keys. The male stranger came in to our villa like a small apartment didn't look to notice with the lights on. My husband forgot to lock the key. I was horrified how did he get in our villa? 

I screamed and cursed when he opened the bathroom door. I was naked. I was vulnerable and I was in a different country. I went after him then I see a daughter about 4 years old with him. He ran to the door to get out.
I had a towel on me and noticed he ran by three villas on the 3rd floor. 

He ran down the stairs. He wasn't even checked in for level 3! I started hyperventilating panic attack instantly. I called my husband whom was getting our dinner. He came back about eight minutes later. 

My husband knows all that I have endured. I cried myself to sleep, I tried to tell him this wasn't an accident. The way floorplan was laid out it's obvious you would see many items that aren't his!

14227.0,1hrocqt,post,Should I (f) be concerned about hugs from my male cousin,"I guess I should preface that I do not really like physical touch/hugs especially from people I don’t like as much. But, I want to hug people I like.

So, my (20F) male cousin (28M) has a problem with me giving side hugs/“shitty hugs.” So, he has taken it upon himself to force me to give him hugs chest to chest for as long as he wants. This also involves squeezing me [towards his body] for like an extra tight hug. This is what he insinuates is a “good hug” and “wasn’t that bad.” Whenever I try to refrain, he makes the hugs longer. If I act like I want to hug him “right,” he still makes the hug last however long he wants.

The issue I am discovering (besides my lack of bodily autonomy) is that I feel uncomfortable when he squeezes me very tightly in these hugs. My boobs are this pushed up against him a lot and it makes me feel weird. I have never thought that this could ever be an issue because he is my cousin and he would never do such a thing. However, I realized that whenever I know I will see him, I make sure to wear a bra/wear a thicker bra to minimize how much of my body touches his. It feels off. If it was nothing why did I cry for hours when I thought of the possibility of him hugging me for any sexual gain?

However, the reason for this post is that I want to know what other men think about this. Would you feel comfortable hugging a female family member that closely? Are hugs like this between male and female family members normal? Am I being over dramatic or is there something more serious going on?","Should I (f) be concerned about hugs from my male cousin I guess I should preface that I do not really like physical touch/hugs especially from people I don’t like as much.

14235.0,m4z9dvt,comment,,"Yes, I would be very concerned.

I don't hug female family members like that. I only hug my best friend who is like a brother to me chest to chest but rarely.

This sounds like what you think it is, he is ~~copping a~~  trying to feel you up by squeezing your breasts into his chest so he can feel them against his body. Trust me, we guys know about those hugs. If I wanted to hug you front to front, I would lean over so my chest stays above your breasts.

The fact he lingers which I am sure catches your attention is a dead giveaway. He is giving you a sexual hug in my opinion,

1. He forces you into it.
2. Your breasts are squeezed to his chest.
3. He lets the hug linger. (Greeting hugs are usually short. Lingering hugs are either comfort or sexual in nature.

So I see that he is a creep. I recommend you never get stuck with him in an unsafe spot Don't drink when he is around and don't get stuck some where alone My brain keeps giving me warning signs about this, He might not go that far, but he already doesn't respect for your boundaries. (You should tell someone as well that it bothers you). 

I am sorry that I am giving you that warning but I keep trying to walk away from this thread but I keep seeing that danger as a possibility that he can do something bad and I feel I have to warn you even though, I feel it is embarrassing to say it."," Yes, I would be very concerned.

14265.0,1hrs44p,post,Never give him a second chance PLEASE ," 

Hello everyone , first of all , im sorry for the English, im not native , idk why im writing this post 

I(22F) already made a post on this subreddit about an assault I experienced from my boyfriend 22M.

Many people rightly advised me to leave this relationship. Unfortunately, I stayed longer in an abusive relationship that was mentally and physically harmful to me, honestly the whole relationship was fucked up. Those who have dealt with a narcissistic abuser will understand. I feel stuck , i love him so much one day he is the best man ever , one day i feel like he hates me
I believed he would change after what he had done because he said so ( i know im really dumb lmao) Unfortunately, forgiving him turned out to be pointless, as things only got worse. 

We went out at night, we didn’t have much planned except to chat in the car and snack on some treats. Unfortunately, my boyfriend has a habit of going through my phone while I’m driving. He found some extremely harmless messages with employees (much younger) that I look after. There was absolutely nothing in the messages that could justify anger, but since he is extremely jealous, he got very upset. We started arguing and he got out of the car , we were parked in front of a forest , i went out of my car and  ran after him trying to speak with him, really stupid move . 

Suddenly after spitting all his hate , he started to kiss me but like very violently , there was something agressive about his kisses. I was like wtf is wrong with him , responded to his kisses thinking that «  the problem is solved . Thats when everything got out of control .

TW : Graphic

After kissing me , he grabbed me by the hair and threw me to the ground , ordering me to give him a BJ. I refused at first , completly shocked by his sudden change of behavior and by the fact we were outside. He insisted , and slapped me on my face, took my hair and forced himself in my mouth , telling me to shut up , that i deserve that , calling me a whore etc… i gave in begging him to at least let me enter the car because i was so scared to be seen by someone like that. 

Many minutes passed before he accepted to enter in the car , i was thinking okey its finished but then hepushed me violently to the backseat and took of my clothes. I was like , « baby please dont i really dont want that »but he was sooooo angry it was like it was not him anymore . He had this anger in the eyes i never forgot. I was like no way , maybe he is joking so i was like baby i really dont want this please , then he looked at me right in the eyes, told me in a serious way to shut up and then forced himself into my v , i was completly frozen and shocked because it was not him anymore.

i was begging him to stop for a while , he was violent slapping me and everything, then my body started to enjoy it , which really fucked me up because i was like maybe its not rape because i started to enjoy it… anyway 
He finished and threw me away , i didnt said anything , i dressed and went home. I felt so broken , but like i was so confused , it took me a while to realise what happened. I went home and didnt saw him since . He sent many message saying sorry and everything…. 
Do yall think its really a rape ? i cant put words on his actions , i know this is bad but putting a word on it sounds terrifying.

I wrote this for me because i really need to talk to someone , but also for yall  if someone is in the same situation , please i know u love him and everything but RUN at the first redflag especially, never forgive him sexual assaults from him .  

You deserve better and u deserve someone who be patient and caring , who is making sure u are consenting ❤️‍🩹 

Take care of yall ","Never give him a second chance PLEASE

Im a 21-year-old woman, and I'm a survivor of inc\*st. I was 6 years old when it happened, and my ab\*ser was my older brother, who is 8 years older than me.

I know that I'm making tons of progresses but there's still one emotion I cannot get rid of : **being afraid and extremely rude with people who remind me of him.** 

I am a kind person by nature, and kindness is one of my most important values. That’s why it’s so painful for me when I find myself acting differently toward people simply because they remind me of him. It could be something as simple as a physical resemblance or similar behaviors—how they speak, joke, or even their facial expressions.  
My brother was very manipulative and always joking around. He was the kind of person who was never serious and who everyone adored because he appeared perfect. But he hurt our entire family. He also abused my older sister and disappeared for three years during his teenage years, breaking my parents' hearts.

So when I encounter someone who reminds me of him, I freeze. I’m shocked by how similar they look or how their words echo his. I sometimes become rude, distant, or disagreeable, which is completely out of character for me. I would never judge someone based on their appearance or mannerisms, so this behavior feels completely foreign to me.

This has become especially difficult since I started a new job and have a coworker who looks strikingly similar to my brother. We have lunch together almost every day, along with other colleagues, and his physical resemblance to my brother, genuinely scares me.

I feel terrible because my coworker is very kind to me, and he doesn’t deserve to be treated this way. I don’t want to be rude to him, but I can't seem to control my reaction. I hate myself for feeling this way, especially because if I saw someone else acting like this, I would judge them.

I don't want to be that person, I don't want to grow old being rude to people who haven't done anything to me just because they remind me of him.

I think it is a kind of defensive mecanism.

Does anyone has any advice on this topic ? Does time help getting through those feelings ? Do you think my instinct is actually protecting me, maybe I feel something is actually off with this co-worker or is it just my broken brain letting my fears taking this huge place ?

  I have been secretly dealing with a past and ongoing sexual assault. It started when I was five and ended around 14. It was very violent the first time. 
   It was a neighbor. I tried to tell my mom but she didn’t believe me. The only other person I told was my therapist.
   I guess I am not wondering would it make a difference if I would talk to the police? Does anyone have any experience in this area. It has been a very long time since it happened. I am in the United States. Any advice would be helpful as I am on and off conflicted with this.

I told him I know what he did and he played dumb I told him I remembered I knew what he did I told him I said no and he didn’t listen and tried saying he only touched me and I called him out he said “I’m in trouble” like he was 5 and caught sneaking candy.

I didn’t want his family to hate him or maybe they’d never believe me anyway I didn’t want to hurt him. I remember when he was done feeling him grab something maybe a shirt or something I just know it was fabric and wiping his mess up off me because he knew I’d know if he didn’t. I laidback down and fell asleep and woke up four hours later and called my brother and he came and got me he doesn’t know what happened. My bf now ex didn’t wake up till early afternoon around 2pm when he did he texted me and didn’t ask why I left or why I didn’t wake him up to take me home but wanted to know if I had his vape and I said no he said he would have taken me home and I guess he thought I was mad and he tried to call me and I ignored it and said I didn’t want to call. I told him I know what he did and he played dumb I told him I remembered I knew what he did I told him I said no and he didn’t listen and tried saying he only touched me and I called him out he said “I’m in trouble” like he was 5 and caught sneaking candy. I have all the screenshots of this conversation too.,24.0,8.0,2025-01-02 18:51,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hs153a/i_was_raped_by_my_bf/,Victim

14321.0,1hs1n3h,post,was i raped if i was blacked out and he was sober ,"when i was 18 i drank a lot. like a lot and by myself

i remember one night this guy came over. his best friend was dating my best friend at the time so we were kinda talking. it was a saturday night around 10 and i was already pretty drunk (i also had work the next morning at 6am

he asked to come over and my mom wasnt home so i said yes. he told me that when he doesnt go home for the night he would drink, so i kept drinking cause i thought he was going to drink too

he got to my house and i offered him a drink a few times but he declined every time. but i kept going 
 
the rest of the night is kinda blurry because i was so drunk

i remember we started having sex and it was really uncomfortable for me. i was really dry and it hurt, but i was too drunk to say anything or stop so i just let it happen 

after that at one point in the night i wanted to smoke, he doesn’t smoke so it was just me smoking a blunt. the last thing i remember was sitting in my yard with him finishing my blunt. after that i don’t remember anything 

a week or two later i asked if we had sex again after i smoked and he said yes. i have no memory of that 

i dont know if it was rape because he sent me some videos of that night (NOT of us doing anything sexual) and i seemed to be having a good time so idk if it counts because i probably didnt ever say no

14326.0,1hs240h,post,I (15F) blame myself because I orgasm during sexual abuse,"I saw a post about being intentionally forced to orgasm during rapes. It made me think about how I was forced to orgasm when I was very young, and how I end up blaming myself for sexual abuse and rape now because I orgasm during it.

When I was in 1st grade (age 6), I had my first orgasm by accident while straddling a metal pole on the jungle gym at school while a boy was banging it with a stick. I didn't know what it was, and I fell off. It was during an afterschool program, and our PE teacher (male) was watching us that day. I remember how he looked down on me as I laid there with my skirt hiked up, holding my crotch. He helped me up and took me inside the gym building to a storage room that had this padded table in it (I assume for sports injuries or something). He said he had to ""examine"" me, which involved laying me on the table, removing my panties, and fondling me while he asked me to describe what I felt on the pole outside. He then told me it was something natural for older girls, but most people will think I am dirty for having it happen so young, so it has to be our secret. For the rest of that school year, he continued to bring me in to that room for ""treatment,"" which involved maybe 10-15 minute sessions of forcing me to orgasm without my control. He also discovered I was being molested at home, so he became more sexual with me as well.

I think from that experience, I learned to masturbate a lot and also orgasm very easily and without control from things that are non consensual or emotionally painful, like humiliation and sexual degradation. Even when I masturbate, I am only able to cum from things like this. I end up blaming myself for enabling things like rape and abusive sexual situations because I orgasm from them, so deep down I feel like I must really want it to happen.","I (15F) blame myself because I orgasm during sexual abuse I saw a post about being intentionally forced to orgasm during rapes.

14332.0,1hs2f9h,post,I'm so ashamed of myself and know this is my fault ,"TW: GRAPHIC


I know this was my fault.

It happened when I was 15. I was seeking support in an online support group and an older man, who could be my grandpa (he was 60) reached out to me. He promised he'd help me heal and recover. He told me he would never have sexual relationship with someone he helped.

However, a few days later, I found a message from him in which he described to me what he would do to me if he could. I mean, in bed.

It was gross and I was confused. I actually never really wanted to have a sexual relationship with him, but I thought it was a way to show love and affection, as he told me. Since then, he used to tell me how sexy I was, how he loved me more than anything, he asked me if I masturbated, told me what sexual stuff he would do to me.

It escalated and he asked me to send him a voice recording of my moaning during masturbation. He told me it was up to me and to only do it if I wanted. I didn't do it. I was embarrassed to do it and I didn't know what he would do with it if I had sent it.

It's worth mentioning that I was above the age of consent in my country at the time, but he was from another state and he could go to prison for that, since age of consent in his country was higher than my age at the time.

I had to end our ""friendship"" eventually after finding out he sent sexually abusive messages to other girls, even younger than me. The person who reported him to the admins said what he did to me was sexual abuse.

I don't think so. I consented. In my country, I was above the age of consent so according to the laws here, it wouldn't be SA. In fact, I even initiated some of those sexual conversations. Yeah, I never really wanted to be sexual together, but I thought it was because we loved each other. I was convinced he loved me.

14351.0,1hs4nau,post,I would have a toddler but had a misscarrige,"It’s feel like it’s all my fault. I was raped at 14 (now 17) and before I knew I was pregnant from it I was so affected from the rape I started drinking and doing drugs a lot and attempted to kill myself which ended me up in a coma for a day at this point I would’ve been about 2 weeks pregnant is my guess. I figured out I was pregnant at about 5 weeks I ended up deciding to keep the baby. I was obviously scared but I don’t know I just felt a bond to the baby even though it wasn’t born yet. And I started to come to terms with the fact I was going to be a mother. But then at almost 15 weeks I’d say I had a miscarriage.  I’d stopped drugs and alcohol as soon as I realised I was pregnant. I didn’t hurt myself at all. Because I wanted my baby to be safe. 

But I guess it’s was too late. The guilt eats me up. I know I shouldn’t be upset. Especially now. I feel like I don’t have the right to be upset. I feel very suicidal because of it though.

Sometimes when we feel helpless our minds become submissive to the danger if it can make the abuse less painful, for example, to avoid more or worse abusive reactions. We're kind of like in a mindspell, idealizing what caused us harm and makes us afraid and traumatized. The helplessness often traumatizes us and makes us extremely afraid that we can get dominated again. And if that fear becomes our everyday thing, we may of course feel overwhelmed and submit to it, idealizing what we're afraid of. 

Also, the orgasm that happened? Not your fault. It happens. Do not blame yourself for it, I don't think that it has anything to do with you liking what happened to you. I think that you may actually hate what happened to you, and you may also feel hurted by that happening. Want an advice? Figure some things out with yourself.

14378.0,1hs7bca,post,"My Experience (Tw: Incest, manipulation,)","So, at the time this happens I was freshly 13 years old and now I’m 14 almost 15 years old. I’m still processing this happening and still cry when I think about what my cousin did to me. I haven’t seen him since it happened. I’m here to share what happened and let some people know that even if you consent, but it feels wrong it’s still SA and should be validated.

What happened and when it happened:

The time it happened:
So, it was only him at my house (my mom and everyone else was sleeping and his dad wasn’t at my house because his dad let just him go to my house) and it was 4 am at the time and we were sitting right next to each other on the couch and he typed on his computer asking if he could touch my thigh or go up or whatever the fuck and then finger me, he didn’t let me read the whole question whatsoever and I basically only read the word finger. I shook my head yes even though I didn’t even fully know what I was getting myself into and my little brother was in the room too but he wasn’t aware of anything happening because we were under a blanket. He then ended up fingering me and then I was questioning what he was doing but my body was physically feeling good because no shit. I told him to stop and he did just that but he did the grossest shit where he smelled his fingers afterward and then tasted them and the only reason I know about that is because I saw it in the corner of my eye. 

After that event:
He asked me on his phone if we could go to my room, so he could eat me out and I shook my head and then we went to my room but we didn’t do anything because I was shy and thought my family would hear us, so then we went back downstairs and he asked if we could do something else on his phone and we ended up cuddling and when we were doing that he actually spoke out loud and said my name and asked if I was awake and then he slept on the floor because it was 6am when we both fell asleep

Days after:
The night of him leaving he messaged me and then we went onto messaging on Discord and that’s when he manipulated me for nudes a lot and only texted me for his own sexual pleasure.

Past events: 
He was sexual with me twice a year before all this happened and he made me send him nudes and after that I had the worst feeling in my body, where I felt so fucking sick to my stomach I almost threw up and I was severely lightheaded.


I have told my mom about what he did a total of like two times-the first time she didn’t think it was SA at all since I said “yes” but that’s not how that goes, the second time I told her she told me about her experience with getting raped and told me to try and move past it. This made anger in me boil up because I wasn’t feeling supported whatsoever. She has told me updates on my cousin and said that he’s getting beat at school and when I found out about it I was so happy on the inside because he finally got karma. He now has a girlfriend and that’s kind of beating me down, since his girlfriend isn’t online and I’ve only ever dated online.

I made it very clear to him that if it was too much, Id stop him, tell him im serious and that I dont want anymore, and that I expected him to stop. 

This morning however, I was very sore from all the sex and I told him I didnt want anymore because it hurt. He kept saying ""are you sure?"" ""i dont hurt"" (as a joke) and ""cmon just a little ill be gentle"". Eventually he pinned my legs pulled down my clothes and forced himself into me anyways. I told him to get off, it hurts, i dont want it. He said ""well youre not really fighting it are you"". He didnt get off for a while until i was moving too much. 

I laid there, trying to process what happened before he flipped me over again and said ""cmon just a little"", ""itll be fine you can do it"", ""i really want to though"" and some other guilt trips. Eventually i realized he probably wouldnt stop so i said yes. He tried again and of course it was extremely painful by now. I tried to push him away and tell him stop but he didnt until it got too difficult for him to fuck me. He got huffy, turned over and jerked off.

Was this sexual assault? I wasnt as upset when this happened but the second i got into my car i burst into tears and have been feeling numb and exhausted since. Should I have been clearer? Did he actually do anything wrong? Maybe he just thought i was into it. What do i even do? ","i think my boyfried sexually assaulted me I think i was sexually assaulted ny my boyfriend and i really dont know what to do.

14390.0,1hs96ij,post,I think I was sexually assaulted by my ex boyfriend,"(warning: this involves me and my ex bf, who are both minors)
A few days ago I (13FTM) broke up with my now ex boyfriend (13M) because of his uncomfortable behavior towards me. He used to say that he wanted to have sex with me despite me not being ready, and he would send DPs and ask to grab my thigh in public. The first incident I remember of him making me uncomfortable in person is when he pinned me against a wall in my music class at school when only him, me, and my teacher were there. My teacher didn't notice. The wall thing was scary and it was the end of the school day so I left and stopped talking. He asked if what he did made me uncomfortable and I just shrugged and told him to go to his bus. When I got home from school, I texted him and said that what he did was really weird and that I didn't like it. He said he understood and that he wouldn't do it again, he apologized too and we moved on to a new conversation.

A few weeks after that, he posted a story on Tiktok saying that he touches himself to photos of me and it made me uncomfortable but I didn't say anything about it, because my best friend sent me that story because I didn't have TikTok, and he already hated her so I didn't want to stir the pot more by bringing it up to him. 

A few days after that, we went on a walk together. It was going fine and we sat down on a bench, and he kissed me. That was my first kiss, his too, and I can't really explain how I felt about it. He kissed me a few more times and then we went to a bigger part of town. This part of town had a few small tunnels underneath the roads that people would go to do graffiti in, and me and him went into one of those tunnels to mess around. I was taking photos of the tunnel and I put my phone in my pocket and leaned on the side of the tunnel because my feet were hurting really bad from walking 3 miles in Doc Martens boots. Almost as soon as I leaned against the tunnel wall, he pinned me against it and kissed me despite him saying that he wouldn't pin me against a wall again. His hands were located on the wall on the sides of my chest, and some parts of his hands were touching the sides of my breasts (I don't know if this was on purpose or not) and eventually he let go and I went to the other side of the tunnel. He pinned me against the wall again and asked to kiss me with tongue and I said no, when in reality I didn't want to be touched or kissed at all at this time. He luckily just gave me a few pecks on the lips before letting me go, and I immediately got out of the tunnel. He followed after me and we continued our walk. He asked if I liked what he did to me and I said yes because I didn't want to upset him or ruin the hangout. We walked to a park, and that park had bathrooms. He asked if I could go into the bathrooms with him and I said no about 3 times before he let up. We sat on a bench and drank Monster Energy before heading back to my house. By this time, my feet were hurting like hell from the Doc Martens and I just wanted to get home and rest, and I made that clear to him. As we were walking to my house, we found another tunnel and he insisted about 10 times that I come in there with him so he could make out with me. I said no over, and over, and over again. He didn't do anything and he got out of the tunnel and we went back to my house. I asked him to not say or do anything weird in front of my parents so we don't get in trouble while we waited for his dad to come pick him up. When we got to my house, he seemed completely uninterested in me because he couldn't say or do anything to me now. He barely talked to me that whole time. 

I broke up with him the day after that and he begged me to stay and said that he was unlovable. I told him that I broke up with him because of the weird stuff he was doing and he said ""but you never said you were uncomfortable with it"" which I guess was true because I only said I was uncomfortable with the thing that happened in Music class when he pinned me against the wall, and the reason I said I was okay with him pinning me against the tunnel was because I didn't want to upset him. When I said ""so it's my fault?"" He said I was guilt tripping him. He said he didn't know that pinning me against a wall was wrong.

I asked him why he did this and he said he doesn't know. He kept bringing up the fact that he was hypersexual and SAd before.

Since the incident in the tunnel I wonder what would've happened if I had just said no to everything. Thank you for reading.","I think I was sexually assaulted by my ex boyfriend (warning: this involves me and my ex bf, who are both minors)

I remember one time he pinched my nipples and asked if I liked it. ffectionately or as a joke again not even sure why he did that.He also  made some comments about sizes. Some of these werent as frequent tho, Were the comments nornal?? I seemed to think yeah? I am a bit afraid I might over exaggerate everything and this whole post might be all over the place I genuinely feel uncomfortable sharing these but I need opinions.
As for additional info we were uh like comfortable? For example as children they told us to shower together, we shared a room (twins) so yeah. As K am finishing this I remember one event with me I feel so uncomfortable im so sorry, I remember he came home I was sleeping and he pulled the foreskin of my private parts yeah I woke up I pretended to be asleep, I  thought this was normal he always told us to pull the foreskin (English is not my first language so idk how accurate this is) to not get infections and phimosis.
More info, I mentioned the homophobic part because he was under the impression gay men dont get hard, So he asked us for that reason I think??, All comments are appreciated thanks for your time, I am sorry if I dont  make sense, it's like 5am and I am having this realization i feel sick sorry
Edit:re reading this I feel like these are silly and fine if it is truly fine tell me about it I..","Were we sa'd?? So uh, My family was not good, a lot of problems all at once, One major problem that lead to a lot of other things was my father's behavior. We were both boys, and he was like homophobic as fuck and he didnt want to grow sissies. Since a young age Like 7 or smth He asked us if we had been erect, Yeah sometimes daily, The following years when he would tell us to hug him, My brother  would like flinch I think??

First of all, you are always entitled to set boundaries for yourself in any manner you choose, with any person you choose. You do not owe a single person any form of physical affection if you do not choose to express yourself in that way.
The really shitty thing about hugging is that most people see it as perfectly normal behaviour. I think some men see that social norm clearly and intentionally take advantage.  I suspect this is what your cousin is doing to you. Yes, it’s probable sexual, or at least a power trip, either of which is gross. 
It is always ok to tell someone you do not want to hug. He might just be a decent person and respect your wishes. He might try to gaslight you into thinking you’re overreacting. If he does, tell him he’s being creepy and don’t be afraid to make a scene. Keep telling him no. I find “get the fuck off me” or even “ stop touching me” is useful language.

14408.0,1hsd96g,post,I recently had an uncomfortable sexual situation. ,"I recently had an uncomfortable sexual situation.

Trigger warning - PTSD (Sexual Abuse) 

Ok so this is going to be a long one and a potentially uncomfortable one. I'm not sure what I'm looking to get out of it, maybe some advice, maybe someone to validate my emotions or maybe someone to tell me that I'm in the wrong and that I need to move on. 

So just to give you some background information. I have intense CPTSD, I was sexually abused as a child by my grandfather. I have been in hospital and worked really really intensely over the past 2 years to work through my trauma and develope skills to be able to survive every day life.  I am at a point where I can live day to day life without being effected but still get triggered, but have skills to work through that. I have not had sex and dont really plan to unless its with someone I completly trust, just because of that trauma. Anyways not the point. 

I am 20 years old and currently on a cruise with family. Me and my step sister, went out a few nights ago on the ship to have some drinks and do some dancing. Now, while we where dancing I ended up running into a man who was if I remember correctly 32. He was nice and we had a conversation and we got talking about if I had a partner and stuff, at which point I realised what was happening. It was at that point that I said no but that I'm not really looking for one and he said oh so just looking for a good time. I said definitely not I have no intentions of having sex with anyone tonight if that's what your asking, he said that he wasn't looking for a hook up and that it was just nice to chat with people which was fine and all. Anyways the conversation died down and I made a getaway to the dance floor and met up with my sister, who obviously asked about the encounter, and I also made it very clear to her that I was not having sex, I didn't want to have sex and that it was just friendly conversation and I made a getaway for a reason. 

A few more drinks and alot more dancing into the night my sister was done and was heading back to our room, I wasn't done tho (In hind site I probably should have been) so I stayed up for a while and was still dancing when I happened to run into the same guy again. At that point he asked if I wanted to dance to which I agreed, but he first took me over and bought me a drink which I wasn't against. It was at this point that I made it clear to him again that I was not having sex tonight and that if that's what he was looking for he needed to go find someome else. (I get nervous that that's all guys want so I tend to try make it clear I don't want that) 

So a few more drinks (that he just kept buying for me and giving me, but I didn't say no to) we where dancing a little closer and more intimately, so when he came back from the bar with another drink for me he said should we go finish this one in his cabin, to which I said yes. Now this is the part I'm confused about because I do remember being a completly willing party at this point, at no point did he force me to go with him, however I was very intoxicated. 

We got up to his room and I went to the bathroom and came out in my underwear and he was in bed naked and I sat on the bed, to which point he grabbed my hand and put it on his dick. I knew that this was leading to sex and I was a completly willing and contributing party until I touched his dick. It was the moment that I touched his duck that I don't really remember much after although I remember that really clearly. I'm not sure if I don't remember because I was drunk or I had a bit of a PTSD response but the rest of the night was kinda a blur. 

I do know that once I touched his dick I realised I did not want to be there and that I wanted to leave the situation. So I told him that, and he got up and then tried to make out with me, but I told him that I had to go and he let me. However I ended up crying in the lobby at some point to which a security guard found and and tried to figure out what happened. I believe that I told them that I touched a guys dick and I didn't want to and I just wanted to go to bed. This then resulted in reports and conversations, to which in my drunken state I told them that he grabbed my hand and put it on his dick, (which did happen, but not necessarily in a malicious way which I think I either made it out to be to the security guards or they took it that way). Somehow I ended up in my bed and had a good spew and went to sleep.

I woke up the next morning and was called down to security to talk to them. I got pulled in and they asked me what happened and I told them, that I was a willing party, until I wasn't and then he let me leave once I wasnt. The security officer made it very clear that he was already aware I was a willing party and it was at that point that they told me that the allegations that I had made had led to a big investigation involving the captain and police, and that they went and spoke to the man last night and it has put him in an extreamly bad mental place because these allegations had been made. Now from what I remember he works in a pretty high up government position so I guess something like this could cause lots of trouble. I asked them what allegation and they said the allegations you made that he forced you to touch his dick. Now he didn't necessarily force me, but I didn't tell the security guards that he did, however I do very clearly remember him grabbing my hand and putting it on his dick and I did tell the security guard that. (Going by the reports they wrote which i later asked to read because I was worried I had said something different) 

I didn't defend myself, I was a bit upset at the time and kinda shocked by the whole thing, however I did say to the security guard that they where the ones that jumped to conclusions, and went to him accusing him before getting the full sober story from me. Anyways I apologised and said that his mental health isn't really my responsibility and explained that I have mental health problems of my own and that I can't take on his emotions. The security guard was very clear that I had done something wrong and that I had caused a major issue and kept talking about fake allegations. He told me that I had been cut off from drinking for the rest of the trip because of this. 

Now I understand that I was a willing party till I wasn't and that he let me go. However having said that I was very intoxicated, mostly from the drinks he kept buying me, and I wasn't really in any position to consent at that point. I also had made it clear to him twice early on in the night that I didn't want to have sex. However I do remember being willing and that is my fault. 

Reading over the report the security guards made from the night. I did tell them that I touched his dick and didn't want to, and that he grabbed my hand and put it on his dick. However when they asked me about how I got to his room, I said I wanted to go and he didn't force me, I said that I came out of the bathroom in my underwear and that he didn't make me feel unsafe. It was just that as soon as he put my hand on his dick I wanted to leave and left. Which I explained to the officers in the morning that this was me having a ptsd response not because of him, however failed to explain this on the night. 

I walked away from the meeting feeling exteamly shitty about an already shitty situation. I am kinda in two minds about it all, because I was a willing party however I was very intoxicated and did make it clear early in the night I didn't want that. I also didn't really make any allegations about him I just said what happened however I do understand how that was taken out of context by the guards, and I don't know what kinda way I said anything either so potentially it is my fault. 

Anyways I'm just really confused atm, and if anyone has any thoughts please let me know. ","I recently had an uncomfortable sexual situation.  I recently had an uncomfortable sexual situation.

14411.0,m54o48g,comment,,"I'm sorry that this happened to you, OP. And I'm sorry that people are asking you questions about what's considered normal in your relationship. It doesn't matter if you've had drunken sex before. In fact, your previous sexual acts have no bearing on this event. At all.

Sex is consensual. Both parties must give consent (either verbally or through an enthusiastic involvement), and consent can only be given if the individual is sober and awake. If you drank enough to blackout, pass out, slur your words, and cause your partner to ask you if you were okay - then you were too inebriated to consent.

Passing out and waking up, clearly demonstrates that you lacked capacity. If your partner noticed that you were acting off, slurring your words, unable to enthusiastically participate - he should've stopped. From what you described, he was concerned enough to stop and ask you a question. At that point, regardless of your slurred answer, he should've stopped. 

In fact, if you were in and out of consciousness - he should've stopped. If you were slurring - he should've stopped. If you couldn't coordinate your movements - he should've stopped. If he respected you - he would've stopped. 

Yes, it's considered rape. It may have started innocently enough, but the moment he questioned whether you were okay or not, but then decided to finish regardless... that's when it went from drunken sex between a couple to rape. He had the wherewithal to recognize you were severely intoxicated and ask if you were okay. He knew, at that point, that you were too drunk to be participating. If there was, even, the slightest question of whether you were or weren't, he should've stopped. 

I can tell by some of the replies, most of the replies, that others don't agree, but we know when our partner is not interested or in the mood. We know when our partner is tired, or mad, or uninterested, and we know when they're too fucked up to have sex. It doesn't matter if you've had drunken sex previously. Prior consensual drunken sex does not mean that you have given blanket consent for future encounters. 

I don't know you or your partner. I can't tell you what his intent was. Legally speaking, you couldn't consent. From a relationship perspective, he may not have thought what he was doing was rape, but it certainly wasn't done with respect or concern for you or your wellbeing. 

Depending on the laws in your state, you could file a criminal complaint. Most law enforcement would probably look at this as a misunderstanding on his part, but it's because cases like these are difficult to prove without a confession. However, if he told the investigator/detective what he told you, he could be charged with sexual assault (in my state, it would be sexual assault in the second degree because you were physically helpless). His admissions to knowing that you were intoxicated, that you were slurring, that you were in and out of consciousness prior to the event or during the event, is a confession, and any prosecutor worth a grain of salt could get a conviction with an admission like that.

I'm not suggesting you file a criminal complaint. I'm just trying to show you that what he did to you is wrong. It's both morally corrupt and illegal. You deserve to be with someone who puts your best interests first. You deserve to be with someone who respects you. You deserve to be with someone who cares about your autonomy. 

Even if he didn't mean to, he did. You deserve to be with someone better than an ""unintentional"" rapist."," I'm sorry that this happened to you, OP.

14422.0,1hsefj0,post,Am I the problem?,"For context I’m someone who experienced CSA with family, a cult, and I think trafficking. I also have DID because of everything 

I feel like I’m about to pour my heart out

My grandpa SA’d me as a kid, the cult and or trafficking (it’s hard to differentiate the two) made us have sex with other children while they watched and random men would show up to sleep with me.
 
I’ve had it explained to me that orgasming during any of this was my body’s response it didn’t mean I liked it

I was hyper sexual as a kid and remember not being able to sleep without masturbating as a kid, I then thought I was broken because I could never orgasm and would try to find out why (this was before I had any memory of any of the traumas I mentioned, my DID hid it) I also would occasionally watch porn starting at age 12.

I get turned on when I think about being raped, I read somebody’s post and quite honestly got turned on and I feel like a monster, I ended up masturbating.

In the past alters would almost reenact the trauma and if I was masturbating with toys they wouldn’t let me stop and I’d cry or a little would front and be very confused about how to stop the toy.
 
I want a healthy relationship with sex but I avoid it usually due to what I just mentioned I guess now I have freedom because I now have control over myself when I masturbate and I can stop and start when I want

But I’m worried I’m a monster I get these thoughts when I look at people how I want to kiss them or do things with them when I really don’t I guess it’s intrusive right? And I guess this all needs time and healing right

A few days ago i was Sexually assault to put into words i consented to having sex for the first time but during it I said stop because he was hurting me and he didn’t stop until he finished. Idk how to feel like my mind is trying to downplay it like it was nothing. I am still shock but still can’t believe it happened or if I’m just overeacting. My keep feeling like it was my fault for not doing anything about it but like at the same time idk how to express my feelings. I don’t know how to feel I feel like I’m overeacting because the way I feel is like it was my fault I have no right to cry or say something about it.

A few days ago i was Sexually assault to put into words i consented to having sex for the first time but during it I said stop because he was hurting me and he didn’t stop until he finished. Idk how to feel like my mind is trying to downplay it like it was nothing. I am still shock but still can’t believe it happened or if I’m just overeacting. My keep feeling like it was my fault for not doing anything about it but like at the same time idk how to express my feelings.

14445.0,1hsge83,post,long-term effects? ,"i have still been struggling to accept that i was likely assaulted. it’s been 5 years now and memories/ associations are starting to come back stronger. i’m at the point where im now starting to realize why i felt the way i did especially when it comes to sex. 

my other posts have the story but tldr: 
it happened on new year’s eve, i was completely blackout drunk w some friends and have no memory of the night from after i passed out. earlier i had made out w the guys there but said i didn’t want to do anything. i think my friend may have done something to me after he carried me upstairs. i woke up being spooned by him with my pants on backwards and a disgusting feeling. i had never had sex before. 
my actual first time was over a year later just hooking up with a guy and it was fine but i felt nothing. i was disassociating and felt disgusting afterwards. i pretended to enjoy sex after that, and i like some of it but often go between disgust and a need for it. 
in general i tend to dissociate during sex, physically go numb, and can’t concentrate or enjoy it much. i honestly don’t even like to be touched anymore since it will just feel like nothing or hurt. ive genuinely never finished with anyone, except one time, and i felt awful afterwards. i realize also i get pretty panicked during sex (internally) and my hands tend to go numb (which only has happened to me during a panic attack). i once got very anxious during a drunk hookup and had to stop. i no longer do hookups for many reasons, but i did for a while because of a weird craving for it, even if it didn’t really feel great. i always felt disgusting and exhausted after. i told everyone i had fun though. i don’t know why i felt the need to lie. but to everyone else i seem completely fine. 

due to emotional neglect/ verbal abuse growing up i used to bottle things up and just dissociate through life. i also had really bad depression/ ed during that time and i wonder if my brain protected me from what happened because forgetting and dissociating is what got me though a lot. i’m in a much better place mentally, especially starting this year, and im guessing that’s why these things started to uncover as time went on. id been thinking about that night randomly since it happened and always brushed the feelings off. i am still struggling to accept what i feel now. when does it start to feel like this is real? 

i’m at the point where im debating actually talking to people about this. i’ve talked to someone at RAINN, got a few helpful comments here, but how do i even begin to explain any of this to people i know? it’s such a weird situation because it was so repressed. i wish i knew more about the night to feel like im not just making this up, but i don’t have anything i can do about that. i don’t feel like i can ignore this any longer though

14461.0,1hsjg3v,post,he thought it was roleplay,"I was sexually assaulted (i guess raped) earlier in december. A guy took advantage of me while I was drunk. I went home early from uni and was traumatised over christmas.

I was vulnerable. I started confiding in this guy I had met in person before. I trusted him because we had kissed that time, and he had asked for consent to kiss me. He valued my intelligence, and we spoke for hours on call, and made each other laugh until our cheeks hurt. It felt like he really cared for me, and he seemed to genuinely like me for me. He raised my self confidence at a time it had plummeted.

We spoke about kinks, and he told me into cnc. I’ve always had an interest in cnc so we role played one evening over text. To be honest, I was actually quite uncomfortable during this but obviously there was no way he could’ve known this. He was obsessed with the idea of me being small and helpless. He thought the photos where I was very thin, 17 (he’s 23), and suffering from an eating disorder really attractive. I know this should’ve been a red flag.

I wanted to go see the fireworks in my city (where i’m studying) for the new year’s eve countdown, so i decided to travel back relatively early to see them (on new year’s eve). He asked if I wanted to see them with him, and because I had nobody else to go with, and i trusted him, i agreed. He said we could meet in my accommodation. He got there at around 7. He’d been there before but not in my room, which i showed him. My flatmates were all out, and I told him this. He started touching everything in my room, and prying into my privacy, which made me uncomfortable, but I told him it was okay. He started getting touchy with me, and I felt uncomfortable, but I didn’t say anything. I don’t remember the order of what happened, but I remember telling him that I was tired, so he suggested I could nap. I laid down on my bed (fully dressed on the covers) and he started touching me, eventually moving his hands under my breasts. I didn’t say anything and he kept making these weird sounds as he did it which made me feel worse. I don’t remember when but at at some point I sat up and told him I didn’t want to have sex because my sti results hadn’t come in. He said he didn’t care about that, and kept saying are you sure, and I kept telling him I was. He mentioned something about a safe word and I dismissed it, hoping he’d take the hint I didn’t want to do anything, so why would we even need a safe word? I took another ‘nap’ and he began again, but got more aggressive.

He thought it was roleplay, CNC. But i hadn’t consented, had i?!! Just because I said yes over text doesn’t mean I was okay with it physically. I had previously told him sex was painful and he had promised to go slow. 

He undressed me and said I had no choice and there was no point me resisting. He was still ‘role playing’. He undid my jeans and belt and I tried to stop him but eventually just let him. I had a pad on but he didn’t care. He fingered me and I didn’t say no, even told him if it hurt or not, and he was gentle which just confused me. He became physical at some points though. He slapped me, pinned me down and grabbed me hard to prevent me from moving. At this point I was saying no, continuously, telling him to stop. he pushed me onto my front and raped me. I was crying, telling him no, to stop, that I was in pain. He didn’t stop for ages, but eventually stopped after realising I was ‘serious’ and saying he didn’t realise I wasn’t just roleplaying the whole time. He apologised. I went to the bathroom to change my underwear and got redressed. I didn’t know what to do. I felt scared of him but also somehow guilty that I had hurt his feelings by saying no. I got him a glass of water and hinted that he go see the fireworks with some of his friends (he was planning on going with them originally). He said he’d already cancelled and he didn’t want to. So we just ended up watching a movie. I acted normal, tried to show him I was fine for some reason. I just wanted to not start 2025 off badly. We watched the fireworks from the roof of my accomodation in the end. I felt so numb. We ordered pizza and I let him sleep round. In the morning I told him to leave and he did.

I trusted him. Part of me still feels at fault for everything. I just wanted to see the fireworks. He took advantage of me when I was most vulnerable. But was it rape if he truly believed it was consensual???? i have no idea.

To be honest, I was actually quite uncomfortable during this but obviously there was no way he could’ve known this. He was obsessed with the idea of me being small and helpless. He thought the photos where I was very thin, 17 (he’s 23), and suffering from an eating disorder really attractive. I know this should’ve been a red flag.

I wanted to go see the fireworks in my city (where i’m studying) for the new year’s eve countdown, so i decided to travel back relatively early to see them (on new year’s eve). He asked if I wanted to see them with him, and because I had nobody else to go with, and i trusted him, i agreed. He said we could meet in my accommodation. He got there at around 7. He’d been there before but not in my room, which i showed him. My flatmates were all out, and I told him this. He started touching everything in my room, and prying into my privacy, which made me uncomfortable, but I told him it was okay. He started getting touchy with me, and I felt uncomfortable, but I didn’t say anything. I don’t remember the order of what happened, but I remember telling him that I was tired, so he suggested I could nap. I laid down on my bed (fully dressed on the covers) and he started touching me, eventually moving his hands under my breasts. I didn’t say anything and he kept making these weird sounds as he did it which made me feel worse. I don’t remember when but at at some point I sat up and told him I didn’t want to have sex because my sti results hadn’t come in. He said he didn’t care about that, and kept saying are you sure, and I kept telling him I was. He mentioned something about a safe word and I dismissed it, hoping he’d take the hint I didn’t want to do anything, so why would we even need a safe word? I took another ‘nap’ and he began again, but got more aggressive.

He thought it was roleplay, CNC. But i hadn’t consented, had i?!! Just because I said yes over text doesn’t mean I was okay with it physically. I had previously told him sex was painful and he had promised to go slow. 

He undressed me and said I had no choice and there was no point me resisting. He was still ‘role playing’. He undid my jeans and belt and I tried to stop him but eventually just let him. I had a pad on but he didn’t care. He fingered me and I didn’t say no, even told him if it hurt or not, and he was gentle which just confused me. He became physical at some points though. He slapped me, pinned me down and grabbed me hard to prevent me from moving. At this point I was saying no, continuously, telling him to stop. he pushed me onto my front and raped me. I was crying, telling him no, to stop, that I was in pain. He didn’t stop for ages, but eventually stopped after realising I was ‘serious’ and saying he didn’t realise I wasn’t just roleplaying the whole time. He apologised. I went to the bathroom to change my underwear and got redressed. I didn’t know what to do. I felt scared of him but also somehow guilty that I had hurt his feelings by saying no. I got him a glass of water and hinted that he go see the fireworks with some of his friends (he was planning on going with them originally). He said he’d already cancelled and he didn’t want to. So we just ended up watching a movie. I acted normal, tried to show him I was fine for some reason. I just wanted to not start 2025 off badly. We watched the fireworks from the roof of my accomodation in the end. I felt so numb. We ordered pizza and I let him sleep round. In the morning I told him to leave and he did.

I trusted him. Part of me still feels at fault for everything. I just wanted to see the fireworks. He took advantage of me when I was most vulnerable. But was it rape if he truly believed it was consensual???? i have no idea.

14471.0,1hskxpi,post,Drunk NYE sex and Secret Recording (Trauma Dump),"TL;DR
I had drunk sex with my roommate whom secretly recorded it, I don't remember how the sex started. He was also drunk. This is a sexual crime in Canada. The video was deleted in front of me but I don't know if it actually was or if he has any more recordings of me as when I asked he was cryptic. We have a complicated dating history he has deep feelings about (I think) 

He is apologetic and insists if theres anything he could do he will do everything I ask of him. 

If I pursue justice and win I can destroy his entire life (he grew up here but is not legal) and he gets deported, or socially outcast depending on what I choose to do. I don't want to do nothing but I don't know what to do. He has 2 daughters and I'm friends with his family.

I don't know how to feel about any of this right now and can't talk to anyone about it because people will chase him down.

— I do have an audio recording of the conversation the day after when he tried to apologize to me, it has his admittance to the record me and everything else. 

I don't know what to do.

-------------------------------------------------------

Recently, New Years eve someone I live with recorded me secretly during sex with him. 

I did not consent to the recording, in fact I've been very vocal about not wanting to be recorded and how I don't take pictures or videos of that nature. In Canada this can be considered Sexual assault and reading all the posts about the subject has me feeling a certain way, I was very drunk when it happened but he was also drinking, and I remember everything from that night besides how the sex started. 

Aside from that he knows people online are looking for pictures or videos of me in a sexual manner and he knows that was suppose to be made a private experience I wanted to share with a long-term partner as I've never taken explicit photos and that was meant for someone I loved and trusted. So I'm scared he may have been posting something online. He acts like it disgusts him that people share things like that and he doesn't understand why social media forces him to consume sexual stuff, I don't believe him as he admitted to consuming it at a ridiculous degree. 

My question is I don't know if I should pursue it in court and if I did would what I have be enough for a charge? I don't know if he's ever recorded me privately before, I live with him and he basically drools over me like a rabid dog. 

I did record the vocal conversation we had the day after the event when he tried to apologize, it has his admittance to the offense but the video of me was deleted the moment I caught him, he did it himself though so I don't know if it's actually gone, I did check his trash. He's preaching that he's going to listen to me about him getting help for his issues and he's deleting all the disgusting things off his phone that I saw (aside from me he's gross about the content he consumes online and he deleted the video of me himself because he wanted to hide it but he ended up giving me the phone) He has asked me what he could do to make it right but he violated me and my trust in my own home and I'm not sure what to do about it or with myself.

Aside from that we've had sex before up until a month and a half/2 months ago, he's tried since then but I refused, I don't know why I said yes this time. Maybe cause I had troubles fighting my feelings for him but I feel if I was sober I likely wouldn't have slept with him because I have strong boundaries. 

He says he only recorded me because I was moving and he would never see me again. Saying shit about how attracted he is to me and bullshit about how hard it is for him. Earlier in the night he was talking like the whole time I've lived here with him we were dating, how he basically wants to get me pregant (he's mentioned it a few times) and he has always gotten emotional about our past. I don't know what justifies his reasoning for recording me, he and I have a complicated relationship that clearly affects him, this was his excuse but I don't know if it's manipulation. I feel like it is after what he did to me, he says he was drunk and doesn't know what he was thinking. When I think of some of our interactions maybe he was being predatorial to me or maybe I'm blowing this up cause this incident is affecting me so badly. Either way he betrayed me and I was always so nice to him, helping him through his problems. He has a complicated past with witnessing sexual things at a young age but am I making excuses for him just because I understand the trauma of it? He admitted he has a problem with porn addiction likely because the trauma of his past gave him an unhealthy relationship with sex but where does that leave me? It doesn't make what he did right. I feel so shameful, and I don't trust myself to make proper decisions in dating after this. I stayed single for 5yrs to heal and work on myself and the first guy I let in does this to me? 

I know his family well, his mom and brothers, his daughters love me, and we share friends in the city, if I told anyone it will spread like wild fire and he will be a social outcast. On the other hand if I pursue this in court and win he will likely get deported. Even with all that I feel powerless. I'm scared if I want to take it to court he'll fight it and win, but is me ruining his life and taking him from his daughters worth it? Would it help me to seek justice knowing I not only ruin his life but affect all those people as well? He says his life is already over I'm not sure why, like when I was telling him I was grappling with whether or not to pursue justice he acted like there was nothing to destroy and he deserved it and he wouldn't be mad if I did, he'd do anything to make it right. He has a hell of a lot more than I do, and he still took from me. I don't know if this is legit remorse or manipulation, my trust is so shaken.

Aside from that his teenage daughter overheard me chewing him out when I first caught him, he says she knows and she chewed him out too. Before this she had me in high regards. I know it's not my fault that any of this happens but, I fought so hard for something like this not to happen to me. My mom tried to protect me from things like this, she warned me she had a bad feeling about him. I feel so bad about how this is going to affect his 2 daughters or my mom if I tell her, how are my friends going to feel about me if I tell them?

I fought for other women who had similar things happened, years ago I had a situation where I discovered my ex sharing local womens photos and videos online. I saw the darkest of the dark on that side of things and I did what was right to protect those women, we took who we could to court. Yet here I am alone and unsure what to do, I'm so conflicted. Am I letting him get away with it?

I feel like maybe it isn't as bad as I'm making it out to be, but I feel like it IS that bad. I consented to the sex but I was so drunk, I didn't consent to the video. I could ruin his life in a second, if I told people, or if I went to the cops. I have that power to take everything from him by pursuing this in any form. But why do I feel so weak and powerless, I don't have anyone to talk to on this as any of my friends or family find out they're going to kick in his door. Every time I walk by where it happened in the house it makes me sick, I feel so dramatic but idk, I'm hoping I can find I'm not alone by posting this, and maybe make sense of all this

I have such bad anxiety about it and I'm just waiting for my depression to get worse, I suffer from C-PTSD so I'm in a highly triggered state for both my anxiety and depression over this. I'm totally oversharing but I appreciate any advice, I plan on calling a therapist once I'm ready if I still need it when I get there. Right now it's hard cause I'm in the thick of it, I just keep crying and I can't sleep. I don't know what to do but I want to do something about it.","Drunk NYE sex and Secret Recording (Trauma Dump) TL;DR

I have seen many posts where people feel tormented and confused because this is happening to them and they think they are horrible people because it happens not realizing that this is a natural response and not proof that they are taking delight in what happened to them or in reading about the suffering of others.

14484.0,1hsnbfc,post,happened on new year's eve. i dont know what to do. i need advice. help me.,"tw (a bit of details)

hi. this is my first reddit post. i dont know where to turn to. im trembling.
3 days ago i think i was assaulted. i held a party in my house with 5 of my closest friends and one of them came to sleep with me in bed (i was already in bed when he arrived and i didnt invite him there). ive known him for 7 years and he is also friends with my boyfriend + we had drunk intercourse some years ago before i met my boyfriend (it was awful). my boyfriend was out of town with his family so he doesnt know about this. 

he came to bed and held me and kissed me and touched me on my upper half. i kept trembling so hard and breathing loud because i was trying to not throw up. he told me i should get close to him to help with the cold and that he felt i was ""excited"" because of my breathing. for some reason i laughed. then i told him i didnt want to have sex because i love my boyfriend. he said hed respect that at first. but he kept and kept asking for ""just"" a kiss on the lips. and he kissed my forehead so many times. he put his body against mine and i felt all of him through my clothes. he bit my ear and held my body. during it all he spoke very gently and was kind to me. 

i think i was saved from going deeper because he started to vomit. i helped him vomit and then i cleaned my bed and put the sheets in the washing machine. we went back to bed. i had to hold  down his hand when we went back to bed because i was afraid he would touch me somewhere else. he vomited 3 or 4 times after this.

after he started sleeping i went to the living room and sat on a chair and looked all night at the fire in the wood stove. i couldnt stop shivering and im still shivering now that im writing this. i havent been able to sleep (i wake up every 1-2 hours) and eat well (everything feels acidic in my stomach). 

I dont know what to do now. he didnt r*pe me since there was no penetration right? and i do love him because he has always been a dear friend to me. he is my friend... i dont want to tell any of this to people who know both of us. 

i will talk about this to my therapist but my problem rn is what to do with our friend group and my boyfriend. should i tell them? or should i wait to talk to my therapist about this? 

and what do i call this? assault? even if he didnt use force and was gentle through all of it?

i feel like im just exagerating because  i know its also my fault because i laughed and didnt force him away (even if i said ""no""). he didnt use force on me. and if i had thrown a fuss my other friends would have come to the room to check what was happening. but i didnt do it. i could have prevented this if i had screamed... maybe i wanted this? i feel awful","happened on new year's eve. i dont know what to do. i need advice. help me. tw (a bit of details)

he assaulted you, and it doesn’t matter that you didn’t tell him to stop verbally, your lack of enthusiasm / the fact you said you didn’t want sex earlier is a clear sign you weren’t consenting and he didn’t listen to you.

when your mind senses you are in danger, the rational side is no longer in control. your primitive survival mode turns on, so any question of what you did in response was likely just your mind and body trying to protect you. the freeze response is a very common reaction to assaults — the flight or fight response is actually not as common as people might expect.

14501.0,1hsqroe,post,Worst night of my life,"Just need to get it out I guess. Might delete soon.

I was in active addiction at the time. I was using mostly heroin, but sometimes coke as well. It was evening time and I had just finished my day of panhandling at a McDonald’s. I saw this guy I had previously seen like lived in the same area as me. He was noticeably high. He asked me for helping scoring him some coke and that he would pay me and I obliged. The first time around everything was fine, I got paid. He immediately shot up some of the coke and wanted more. At this point I really wanted to leave but he was pleading with me to help him. So I took him again to the dealer, but as we were walking he pulled out a gun. He swore up and down that I was hiding coke from him and I really wasn’t. He made me give him the cash I had made during the day but refused to believe me when I told him I didn’t have any coke. He forced me into a random building in the projects. We were in the staircase and he made me watch porn on his phone while he masturbated. He was groping me everywhere and had me give him a handjob and tried to get me to give him oral but I begged him to not make me do it. He was all over the place, high as fuck and sweaty and disgusting. I don’t know if he got irritated or what it was but once I said I didn’t want to do oral he made me get face down on the floor and that’s when he got on top and started having sex with me. He was high on heroin and coke and couldn’t finish for a really long time and I can still hear the sounds he made and it’s fucking disgusting. 

This was in a really bad area, by the projects with a lot of addicts and drug dealers and things like that. Someone saw and knew what was happening and just walked away. It was the most helpful I’ve ever felt in my entire life. But that’s just how it is there, people don’t intervene, they don’t want to start trouble. They just mind their business and go along with their day. But I can’t help but feel so worthless from that. 

When the police arrived my clothes were undone, bite marks on me and I was completely breaking down. They didn’t take me to the hospital and I didn’t go. They took me straight to the police station. He was already arrested and I could see him in a holding cell while I was waiting to speak with police/detectives. He had gestured at me that he was going to kill me. Long story short he was released. I was subpoenaed to speak to the ADA the next day where they told me that he had a long criminal record or violent crimes against women, but we had different stories and because I was an addict I wasn’t credible. He said we were using together and it was all consensual. I had an order of protection but that isn’t much tbh. He was eventually released and nothing came out of it in the end.","Worst night of my life Just need to get it out I guess. Might delete soon.

I saw this guy I had previously seen like lived in the same area as me. He was noticeably high. He asked me for helping scoring him some coke and that he would pay me and I obliged. The first time around everything was fine, I got paid. He immediately shot up some of the coke and wanted more. At this point I really wanted to leave but he was pleading with me to help him. So I took him again to the dealer, but as we were walking he pulled out a gun. He swore up and down that I was hiding coke from him and I really wasn’t. He made me give him the cash I had made during the day but refused to believe me when I told him I didn’t have any coke. He forced me into a random building in the projects. We were in the staircase and he made me watch porn on his phone while he masturbated. He was groping me everywhere and had me give him a handjob and tried to get me to give him oral but I begged him to not make me do it. He was all over the place, high as fuck and sweaty and disgusting. I don’t know if he got irritated or what it was but once I said I didn’t want to do oral he made me get face down on the floor and that’s when he got on top and started having sex with me. He was high on heroin and coke and couldn’t finish for a really long time and I can still hear the sounds he made and it’s fucking disgusting. 

This was in a really bad area, by the projects with a lot of addicts and drug dealers and things like that. Someone saw and knew what was happening and just walked away. It was the most helpful I’ve ever felt in my entire life. But that’s just how it is there, people don’t intervene, they don’t want to start trouble. They just mind their business and go along with their day. But I can’t help but feel so worthless from that. 

When the police arrived my clothes were undone, bite marks on me and I was completely breaking down. They didn’t take me to the hospital and I didn’t go. They took me straight to the police station. He was already arrested and I could see him in a holding cell while I was waiting to speak with police/detectives. He had gestured at me that he was going to kill me. Long story short he was released. I was subpoenaed to speak to the ADA the next day where they told me that he had a long criminal record or violent crimes against women, but we had different stories and because I was an addict I wasn’t credible. He said we were using together and it was all consensual. I had an order of protection but that isn’t much tbh. He was eventually released and nothing came out of it in the end.",9.0,7.0,2025-01-03 16:46,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hsqroe/worst_night_of_my_life/,Neutral

There is tons of people there and everybody just parks their boats and party’s in the water together. I was there with a group of friends but we were all mingling. I met this cute guy and started hanging out with him at the party. He kept feeding me drinks and kissed me a few times. He led me away saying we should swim and brought me to the edge of where the boats were and we swam but then when we got closer to the boats he pulled me behind a big boat and started kissing me. I told him to stop but he wouldn’t. He pulled my bikini bottoms off and started trying to get inside me. The water was about waist deep so it was hard to struggle. He kept pushing my head underwater when I’d fight too. He ended up getting his way and then just disappeared back into the crowd.

It took me two years to finally tell someone. I was recently diagnosed with PTSD. 
I don’t share my own experience to bring attention away from yours but rather to tell you by example that what happened to you IS sexual assault. Your body will know even before your brain does, hence the full body shaking afterward and when you think back to what happened. If something in your gut tells you something about that situation was wrong, it’s because it was. 
I never told my friend group what happened to me on that vacation. It’s now been three years and I’m no longer friends with them. I never reported it, never went to therapy until years later or anything. 
I never confronted the guy who assaulted me either. I cut him off, removed him from all of my social medias and tried my hardest to never speak to him or see him again. I simply faded out with the other friends of the group and now I have no ties to him. 
I will say, it is completely up to YOU on how to navigate your relationship with your boyfriend, your friends and the man who assaulted you. Whatever you feel like will bring you the most closure and peace is the best route to take. I do think your boyfriend should know for not only his sake but for yours as well. It’s never easy to have that conversation but you are capable of it. You have control over what you do with your experience. 
What I will say is without a shadow of a doubt, tell your therapist. They will help you navigate healing, dealing with your boyfriend and your friends and much more. My therapist saved my life in a lot of ways and if I can advise anything, it would be to be transparent and follow their advice.

14526.0,m57wq8y,comment,,"I don't have a professional answer, as I would've been mortified if my mother talked to me about my assault. She's the last person I'd want to hear about the things that were done to me, but idk your relationship. 

What I CAN advise is that if she does talk to you about it, you have to control your face. I'm sure she wouldn't want to tell you something just to feel bad later because whatever she said seems to have upset you. The reaction a victim gets from people when talking about their trauma shapes how much they feel they can talk about it. She needs to know that she's not gonna hurt your feelings or upset you by talking. Just support her. Don't act scared of what she might do or change how you interact with her. Don't treat her like she's broken. Just be her mom and be ready to support her or listen. 

It'd also help if you kept your mental health in check as well. Being a victim of assault is really fucking hard. But I can imagine watching someone you love go through the aftermath of being assaulted is devastating as well. No one is equipped to handle this alone. Maybe you can find a support group for loved ones of assault survivors? The way you talk to/treat victims is such a sensitive line to toe around, I think it'd help to get meaningful advice to know how to help her and make sure that what happened to her doesn't affect you more than it has to. 

On top of all of that, if she doesn't want to talk to you, don't push her. Sometimes it's just hard to tell people who you know/trust because you don't want them to see you differently. Sometimes they really just don't want to. Nothing wrong with letting her know you're ready to listen whenever she's ready to talk. But try not to feel too hurt/offended if she wants to keep you out of it. Nothing she does or says that may upset you is personal. She's just trying to get through it. For what it's worth, I think it's great that you're trying to get advice for that. A lot of moms just ignore what happened or blame their daughter because of reasons I really don't understand.

i grew up mormon, in a strictly religious place. i was taught a lot of purity culture and shame. when you are a mormon, you will be asked things about sex behind closed doors by an adult man when you are around 8 years old. i was asked “do you follow the law of chastity?” i was 8, i knew what sex was, but i didn’t entirely know what the law was. i had to ask and have sex come up in a conversation between me and a 60 year old man. recently, i haven’t been able to stop thinking about it.

i was also taught that my body was desirable from a very young age. i was taught shame and modesty culture, and as a child i took religious beliefs very seriously. i now realize that i’ve had some forms of responses to these emotions i’ve experienced early on. i just don’t feel like this necessarily counts as sexual trauma, because nothing really happened. but i just think about what could’ve happened all the time.

14577.0,1hsyd9j,post,Is it still SA if I liked it? TW,"



So I (F15) have been talking to this guy (M29) for about 5 years now after he messaged me on instagram. We became pretty much became friends overtime and he lives in a different state about 3 hours away from mine. 



Last year he confessed to me that he has feelings for me. I didn’t expect it, but I said I like him too. I did like him. So then we started dating I guess. He was very very nice and reminded me alot that he cares about me and that I can talk to him whenever (I was struggling with anxiety). And he was pretty overwhelmingly affectionate and it made me feel good and something I've never felt before. 



A couple months later we met for the first time after school for like 15 mins where he could pick me up and drop me at home for the usual duration of me walking so my parents won't question or be worried. 



Over the last year we had met up 7 times and we only went as far as oral but we had discussed sex a lot and I insisted I wanted to wait a while before I do anything further. So during Christmas my dad was invited by his boss to go trekking with mum and my grandma was staying over but I told my parents I will be at my friends house. After I told this to him about it and he decided to get an Airbnb close to my house and so this would be the first time we would be hanging out together in 2 years outside of his car. 



\*Trigger warning for this point on as I will provide detailed context\*



So my parents left on the morning of 26th and I was with my grandma till the evening. After she went to bed he came and picked me up from my house and we went to his place. He introduced me to weed, he had been talking about it over time as he is a user and so we did which was fine because I only did a little. In the middle of the night we got sexual and there was a moment where I was laying on the bed, he was on top of me and he was rubbing up against me suggesting he put it in and this kept going a while and he got a bit annoyed at the fact that I was resisting and we had a chat about this later on he submitted apologizing to me that he was just in that moment and horny for a person that ""HE LOVES"". This is the first time he told me that he loves me and we were both taken aback by it initially but I guess I loved him too all this time without admitting it. And after talking about what happened he jokingly mentioned in passing ""now that we love each other there's no other reason for us not to have sex""



Before 6am I went back home, slept for a little while and had breakfast and told my grandma I was leaving to my friends house and we went to his again and within ten minutes of me being there, I was naked in his room, and I was okay with the foreplay we were doing a while. After this he wanted us to smoke more weed and we did and after when we were messing around in the bed we continued to smoke them and we were in the same position as we were in the morning where he was rubbing against me and this time I was high and during this time we kept saying to each other we love each other. At this time I was obviously wet and somewhat on my way close to finishing when he put it in and for a while I was somewhat in shock looking at the ceiling and then randomly realizing what's was happening. After my realization I was said to have been moaning. 



Did he guilt trip me into having sex when I didn't say yes? Was it coercion or is it a me problem because I liked it and continued?

Last year he confessed to me that he has feelings for me. I didn’t expect it, but I said I like him too. I did like him. So then we started dating I guess. He was very very nice and reminded me alot that he cares about me and that I can talk to him whenever (I was struggling with anxiety). And he was pretty overwhelmingly affectionate and it made me feel good and something I've never felt before. 



A couple months later we met for the first time after school for like 15 mins where he could pick me up and drop me at home for the usual duration of me walking so my parents won't question or be worried. 



Over the last year we had met up 7 times and we only went as far as oral but we had discussed sex a lot and I insisted I wanted to wait a while before I do anything further. So during Christmas my dad was invited by his boss to go trekking with mum and my grandma was staying over but I told my parents I will be at my friends house. After I told this to him about it and he decided to get an Airbnb close to my house and so this would be the first time we would be hanging out together in 2 years outside of his car. 



\*Trigger warning for this point on as I will provide detailed context\*



So my parents left on the morning of 26th and I was with my grandma till the evening. After she went to bed he came and picked me up from my house and we went to his place. He introduced me to weed, he had been talking about it over time as he is a user and so we did which was fine because I only did a little. In the middle of the night we got sexual and there was a moment where I was laying on the bed, he was on top of me and he was rubbing up against me suggesting he put it in and this kept going a while and he got a bit annoyed at the fact that I was resisting and we had a chat about this later on he submitted apologizing to me that he was just in that moment and horny for a person that ""HE LOVES"". This is the first time he told me that he loves me and we were both taken aback by it initially but I guess I loved him too all this time without admitting it. And after talking about what happened he jokingly mentioned in passing ""now that we love each other there's no other reason for us not to have sex""



Before 6am I went back home, slept for a little while and had breakfast and told my grandma I was leaving to my friends house and we went to his again and within ten minutes of me being there, I was naked in his room, and I was okay with the foreplay we were doing a while. After this he wanted us to smoke more weed and we did and after when we were messing around in the bed we continued to smoke them and we were in the same position as we were in the morning where he was rubbing against me and this time I was high and during this time we kept saying to each other we love each other. At this time I was obviously wet and somewhat on my way close to finishing when he put it in and for a while I was somewhat in shock looking at the ceiling and then randomly realizing what's was happening. After my realization I was said to have been moaning. 



Did he guilt trip me into having sex when I didn't say yes? Was it coercion or is it a me problem because I liked it and continued?

The main thing is I remember my dad letting me pull down his pants and I thought it was funny. I don’t remember much before or after that. I know I was extremely hyper sexual as a kid and I would have my siblings run into my crotch I was extremely young that was about the same time I was pulling down my dad’s pants. I remember a dream of my dad’s penis wrapping around me and going down my throat. I also have a small memory of being in a group with my dad and men telling them I have a crush on him and it just felt extremely off I could never explain why. I was extremely hyper sexual at a young age and I remember one thought that I had abt sex with another kid and it was extremely violent saying I wanted to fuck him then after panicking because of those thoughts to where it stuck with me. I was around 9/10. At 14 I developed pocd and was getting stimulated to violent thoughts of violent situations and would feel guilty or didn’t understand why I felt this way but it’s get so bad it would hurt. Also was potty trained but later continued bed wetting at around 7/8 years. My sisters were also potty trained but then later started to pee the bed again. My mothers friend also recently told me that my dad did seem touchy with me and my sister had shown signs as well I just don’t have the memories of the acting to know or not and it’s extremely confusing and I don’t feel valid. I’ve always felt this way and I tried telling my mom but she kinda shut me down or told me that if it did happen at least I was young enough not to remember she tried to comfort me but she’s not really in the right mental state to do so. I’ve had ppl use their trauma against me and the main thing that would trigger me is hearing abt ppls sa trauma bcs I never felt valid I just felt like there was something there the feeling that something happen but no memories to back anything at all. I dont have to many memories at all. But it was like I was jealous of them in my mind it was because they had the proof but if I’d just assumed it happened then I was felt I was asking for attention. Giant chunks of my life are gone. So I just need a little bit of help telling if these are signs or if I’m just pushing it. My dad was also physically abusive towards my mom me and siblings. I’m the oldest so I was alone with him the most. I also get extremely triggered by rape scenes or things I hear abt from a young age I’d get aroused. Or screaming id also get aroused. Certain screams trigger me and I get the feeling if my sisters did get molested as well then that’s what the screaming was. I just can’t tell but that’s my gut feeling as of right now.

14583.0,m59b4di,comment,,"This was absolutely sexual assault. For one, he’s nearly twice your age and should not be doing sexual things with 15-year-olds, full stop. It sounds like he’s been grooming you for a while (since you were around 10) by making you feel supported and safe with him (you aren’t). For another, getting you high in order to continue pressuring you into sex 100% counts as rape, and that wouldn’t change if you were the same age as he is. 

And lastly, to address the question in the title, yes it is still assault even if you experienced physical pleasure as it was happening. The body comes with these physiological reactions built in – you have nerves that exist to send you signals about temperature, pressure, texture, and yes, pleasure, but having those nerves stimulated and experiencing those sensations doesn’t say anything about whether or not you actually wanted that touch. Please please know that experiencing physical pleasure, expressed through wetness or orgasm or moaning, doesn’t negate that this was very serious sexual assault on many levels.

I strongly strongy encourage you to cut all contact with this man. If you have any other trusted adults in your life you could talk to about this (parent, teacher, etc.), I also encourage you reach out if you feel safe doing so. If therapy is accessible to you, it may help to talk through and process this with a professional. Most of all, please know that none of this is your fault. He is the adult in this situation and it is his responsibility to maintain boundaries and keep you safe, something he quite clearly has no interest in doing; again, him messaging you on Insta as a young child was predatory behaviour. You deserve much much better than to be treated this way. I’m so sorry this happened and wish you warmth and support."," This was absolutely sexual assault.

Best case scenario he's selfish and clueless, worst case scenario he genuinely gives no fucks about your comfort or boundaries.  Either way fuck that.

14603.0,1ht1hrg,post,My ex scared me while having sex two months ago so we broke up. We met back up on nye and I think he sa'd/raped me,"I'm so confused and I don't know what to do. I think I was sexually assaulted and/or raped on New Years by my ex. We broke up a couple days after Thanksgiving because while we were having sex, he took my vibrator out of my hand and threw across my bedroom on the ground. I had a pretty tight grip on it, so he used force to take it from me. Immediately, I shut down and started to whimper a little bit because he scared me very badly. I thought then that he was going to get rougher and more violent. After 30 sec or so, he noticed that I was upset and stopped. He said that that the sex position we were in was hurting his d\*\*\* and that ""it felt like I was f-ing the vibrator and not him."" I was very scared and alarmed because no one has ever done that to me. A couple days later, I broke up with me because I couldn't get over it - I didn't want to be in a relationship with someone who can't communicate with his words or with someone who scares me.

At some point in mid-December, we reconnected. We never went no-contact. He said that even if I don't want to date him, he wants to be there and root for me. I suppose I fell for that and kept my communication line with him open. By that point, he had apologized several times and it felt genuine. He let me express my feelings about what happened freely and took 100% ownership and shared with me what he planned to do to make sure things like that never happen again and to grow as a person. The more we talked, the more I wanted to try dating him again. We made a plan to meet up on nye.

Long story short, we had sex that night, but it was good. I felt safe, and he made sure I was good the entire time. We had sex again on New Year's morning. Later that day, I smoked some weed and took a nap. I got pretty high, I was visibly high. Maybe like 10-20 minutes after I woke up (still very sleepy), he was on top of me. I didn't even have time to react or say anything. He just started kissing me all over, squeezing me tight, maneuvering me carelessly. At first I thought that he was getting out of hand because he was high, but I remembered that he didn't smoke. He was sober. And my heart sank. My body language was stiff and nonreciprocating. It lasted a couple of minutes. I think I was trying to gently push him so he knew I wanted to stop. He stopped eventually. But then he asked me if he could lick down there. I don't remember if I verbally said no or if I just shook my head, but immediately after I expressed that I didn't want that he raised his voice and started begging. He wasn't yelling but he was speaking in such an urgent way, desperately even. The desperate that looks like you'll do anything to get what you want. I don't think he's ever begged me like that. I was again scared. I think I meekly said okay or shook my head yes. It hurt, I don't know why he was so rough. He's never been like that before. I dissociated immediately. I think it was visible that I wasn't enjoying it. When he was done, he went to the bathroom. When he came back, he kinda chuckled to himself and said sorry. I asked him why he was sorry and he said something like ""I just had to.""

He promised that he would check in with me during sex and he promised to be gentle before meeting on nye. I feel worse than I did on Thanksgiving. I was not in a place to address it with him in person. The day after, I called him and said that I want to take a break from intimacy and that we need to talk about how I can feel safe in the intimate moments we aren't have penetrative sex. I didn't share with him that I was feeling violated. He said that that makes sense and said he understood why I was feeling like that. He asked if there was anything he could do to support me.

I feel so confused. Do you think he knew what he was doing on New Year's Day? Can it be coincidence that things are getting progressively worse, more violent? I can't believe this is happening to me, my mind is so blurry. I've been crying all day trying to make sense of it. How could he not know I didn't want to? Did he plan to rape me?

On New Year's Eve, we were talking about my past sexual partners (it turns him on), and I talked about one guy who pressured me into having sex with him. A part of me wonders if he was trying to reenact that. I understand why people tell you not to tell your boyfriends about how other men have mistreated you.

I'm just feeling really confused. I don't know what to do. I tried chatting with the RAIIN hotline but I've been waiting for 4 hours and I feel so alone. I feel like my friends and sister will be so disappointed in me - I should've stayed broken up. I ignored the signs. I've been looking up definitions for sexual assault, rape, and consent. I just hate that I fit into these categories now. I know he groped me, kissed me, and pressured me into having oral sex.  I just don't know how to say my ex bf sexually assaulted and raped me.

I also don't know what to say to him. Do I tell him that he raped me? How do I break up with him? Do I ghost him? It's too late to go to the police, I feel so stupid. I didn't even think about that. My heart doesn't want to break up with him, but I can't imagine any way we could have a relationship after this. This can't be how my future husband treats me, at least not a husband I want. I just can't believe I let this happen. I did let it happen. I'll take any insight and advice. Thx for reading","My ex scared me while having sex two months ago so we broke up.

 And what makes it worse is he loudly and proudly online posts about being against sexual assault. I feel so helpless, hopeless sometimes. I couldn't stop him and now he gets to virtue signal all the time and I'm left with the everlasting PTSD of what he did.

My therapist told me what he is doing is just a form of self protection to make him appear like a nice guy. It still makes me so mad. I wish I could call out what he did for what it is. I wish I could fully acknowledge the pain he gave me, the scope of how bad what happened really was.","I still struggle to call it what it is  I say he 'had sex with me'.

You told him what he needed to do for new years and he promised and  and it sounds like it broke it the next morning. It sounds like he doesn't respect you and is trying to skirt the line of what he things is right or wrong and not realize he is over it.

He has shown he has violet behavior and that vibrator was an ego thing. He didn't want you to get off unless it was his cock that was getting you off. That is quite selfish and egotistical. 

He was on top of you when asleep, that is a very bad sign. (I am not sure how much he was doing from your description but still, mounting on someone unconscious even without sex is still a bad sign.  
How much did you actually let happen? He was pressuring you.

You were intoxicated and not him and he kept begging after you said no. It sounds reasonable to assume you were too intoxicated to leave the situation. He did not get intoxicated,

All that evidence looks very points to him being abusive to get his way. It was SA and rape as you said and you can't have the good side of him without the bad side and that bad side is getting stronger.

I was dumb and I met him off a website and I ubered there cause I didn't want to drive with him 




When I tell you I was trying so hard to keep myself safe, I asked the waitress to keep an eye on me because I was SCARED



But I started drinking and I got excited and he showed up and he was huge, like not obese but muscled and tall and older than me 




He was 51 and I was 26














I got drunk, I think, and I asked him if he wanted to go to a hotel 






It got real scary real fast and he ignored me every time I said no or stop and I know I put myself in this position 










It ruined my life, you guys. I bled for over a week from my genitals. I had a kink in my neck from where he choked me out for longer than that. 








I was in grad school. I had an internship. I can't have been raped. I asked him, didn't I? 






I found out later that he had been jailed for beating up two teenagers outside of their high school 




He's a bad man






But sometimes I feel so guilty. Like I did this to myself. I know it's not true and I know it's not rational. But I remember. He choked me out. He wouldn't stop when I said stop. But I met him off this stupid website, and I feel like I should have known better.

14620.0,1ht3o5g,post,3 years later ,"3 years ago there was 3 separate (what I think are sexual assaults) I haven't been able to talk much about it but I have told one person. 

I was in mentally abusive relationship and after we broke up I continued to live with him because I moved across the world to be with him and had no money left after he took so much of it. It got worse and worse. I had such little confidence left and mental +physical health was horrible. I also have a chronic illness.

The first assault I was with who I thought was an older friend (20 years older) I thought he was gay  and I slept there many nights before when we would have some drinks or gummies. One night he acted weird and he kept saying I looked like his ex wife and I didn't know he had one, then fast forward to when I went to sleep I was not sober and very out of it and woke up to him poking me with it. I froze and I didn't know what to do and I didn't want to but I was too scared to say no and had no where to sleep if I did, so I just said ""please where a condom"" he laughed and said you're so innocent but he put one on, then I woke up to him 2 more times. In the morning I was so confused and he looked like he felt really bad then the next week's he kept trying to give me free things like tickets to concerts. I never saw him again and moved.

The next one happened I think only a month after I went on a date with him the night before and we did consensually do it, but everything felt wrong because I was doing it because my ex said no one will ever want me but him and I think I needed to prove to myself that wasn't true. I didn't sleep the whole night after, then the next day I went with the guy and later in the day we went down to his boat cabin and he took off my clothes but I stopped him and said we needed to use a condom, he said we didn't last night so why now, I said I wanted to, but he didn't listen and just pulled my pants down and went inside and I froze like the other time and I feel so disgusted with myself because I couldn't fight I was too scared and he was hurting me so I tried to  give him a blow job instead but he pushed me away and threw me on the bed and was really rough and said ""do you like this"" and I said NO and all he did was repeat no and laugh, and so I just laid there lifeless I couldn't move. After it was over he forced me to take a shower.

The next was the ex I had. I went over to his because I'd found out I had gotten an STD from the guy on the boat. He reacted fine at first which surprised me, and then he was very sweet and he said he missed me and we were going to have sex, but when we were he suddenly got really rough and that had never happened before. he choked me hard ( I never wanted or liked that) and said I was only his and no one else would have me. And he kept repeating ""you are mine bitch"" over and over and I had that same lifeless feeling where I froze and couldn't do anything. I thought at this point it was my fault for all of them, and he would tell me all the time people will take advantage of me, that I'm too innocent, and now they had and he was right.

For a year I put it out of my mind pretended nothing happened and tried to forget, but obviously that never works. 

Everytime I think I'm healing something triggers a memory and it starts replaying in my mind. But I also feel so disconnected like it's a memory of someone else that I've seen and not mine. And I feel so much shame and disgust in myself for not fighting.

I also still go back and fourth if it was assault, because I didn't fight and the first one I said to wear a condom. But I didn't want any of them, I just froze and couldn't move when I got scared. 

I feel like I'm so messed up now. I also feel so guilty thinking what if they do it to someone else.

The few people I told vaguely are empathetic but they seem too uncomfortable to talk about it and sometimes I feel I need to or should. I've tried a therapist but I couldn't say it out loud either. 


Is there anything you recommend that would help me try and heal from all this? Anything that helped you? 

For my own peace of mind can you confirm that this is sexual assault?

14622.0,m5afwh7,comment,,"I replied to another post you made, and noticed it, and others, were removed, either by moderators or by reddit filters... which is about the extent that reddit can help you.

The long and the short of it is that you need to see a therapist.   You are young, and still developing, emotionally, intellectually, sexually and physically.   It is really hard to be 'messed up' if you are still growing and learning. 

You have certainly had traumatic stress. And that's enough to seek therapy. Whether or no it exactly fits the criteria for either PTSD or CPTSD, or if it is, or is not assault,  is not really that important, at the moment. Just get into therapy and start the work.

If, however, you are new to therapy, be prepared to ride the roller coaster. You will, likely, feel strongly in the short term, and sometimes conflicted, and, perhaps, dredge up some things that are really uncomfortable. The first step is getting clarity, and clarity sometimes hurts. I don't want to frighten you, but I also don't want you to think that therapy is a magic switch by which you suddenly feel better. It's work. It's sometimes very uncomfortable. It is well worth it.

14624.0,1ht450m,post,I think I was assaulted ,"I went to hook up with a man I’ve known for a few years. We had before, and I was practically in love with him.

He choked me during sex. I tapped out and he didn’t stop. I almost passed out. He hit me at least five times, and I am pretty sure he gave me a head injury. I did not ask him to do this at all. I think he was just angry. He said he felt worthless prior to this and is really self conscious. I laughed before he hit me because we were just stoned. I think he thought I was laughing at him. I dissociated the rest of it. 

I’ve never seen him like this before. I never thought he would hurt me. He has gone through sexual assault before. 


I’ve been raped, at 5 & 18 so calling this sexual assault sounds pathetic. But he didn’t stop. And I got scared. He apologized and said he “didn’t think he hit me that hard” 

I feel sympathy for him. He really thinks he’s worthless and I’ve loved him for years. We’ve had a similar fucked up abusive childhood. 

I never thought he’d hurt me in any sense. He’s the only man I felt safe with other than my father. But he didn’t stop and I don’t know why. I don’t think he meant to hurt me.

14628.0,m5ak39c,comment,,"I went back and looked at some of your old posts. Can I share info from there here? 

You are not an imposter, You were raped. If you prefer the term sexual assault you can, rape is a kind of it.

You sent plenty of messages that it was not okay and he pushed and forced through them.

I agree with your therapist. He is trying to get ahead of anything so he can deny it and point to what he said. (which isn't proof of anything really)

I know you are struggling.

I tell you what, I am going to write out a long list of things that are not proof you consented. Many won't be what happened but some may be. You can choose what applies to you.

\-Agreeing to start sex is not permission to do anything, Any sign of resistance verbal or physical is a sign to stop

\-State of dress is not consent.

\-A person can not be unconscious or seriously impaired where they can't give reasonable consent.

\-Non-resistance is not a sign of consent. (freezing, fawning, or fear can lead to non-resistance)

\-One does not have a right to ""finish"" if consent is withdrawn during an act.

\-Saying no doesn't have to be verbal. Pushing or blocking body parts or recoiling is acceptable

\-Not saying no is not saying yes.

\-Looking aroused is not consent. Fear can look like arousal.

\-You have a right to say no at any time.

\-pushing someone who says no over and over till they say yes, is coercion and not true consent.

\-Putting someone is a state of reasonable fear or difficulty exiting a situation is also coercion

\-A person complying to demands where consent was not given or coercion was involved is not proof of consent.

\-Physical arousal (erection/wetness) is not a proof of desire or consent. The body can react to fear and stimulation the same way as arousal.

\-Orgasming is not proof of acceptance or desire, Again, fear and physical stimulation can cause this without someone wanting it.

There, that is a good list. Some of these maybe we can argue on fine details but this is there you go. If penetration of any or the three main orifices took place without consent it is rape (In many parts of US, it can be any body part or object and it still counts.)"," I went back and looked at some of your old posts.

14630.0,1ht4iu6,post,I don't know whether my boyfriend (22M) took advantage of me (23F) when we were both drunk and I need advice. ,"I don't know exactly how this works but I've seen posts on tiktok where people have asked for advice and I really need help. I don't know if I'm meant to put some sort of warning but I will be talking about some kind of graphic sexual stuff which I will try to tone down as much as I can.

I (23F) finally moved to a new city with my boyfriend (22M) a few months ago. We've been together almost 4 years and had been desperately looking forward to this whilst doing a year of long distance. After finally finding a good job here we made the move and until the other night it's the happiest I've been in years probably. 

Some backstory before I get into what happened. My bf is super attentive and caring, he does probably more chores than me round the house to the point where I sometimes feel bad (even though I'm not necessarily lazy, he just loves things clean and orderly and also doing stuff like this to make me happy). He tells me he loves me all the time and is genuinely such a sweet person normally (my family and friends all love him) Honestly, up until now I barely have a complaint (apart from the fact that he can maybe be slightly switched off and oblivious in certain cases which kind of ties into this story i guess). Another important fact is that there was a time early on on our relationship where we wouldn't use protection during sex (literally every now and again but not often, for reference, I've never been on birth control). I think because of this he'd sometimes get a bit cocky before having sex and kind of suggest we not use protection or maybe just try and go for it until I told him no (it wasnt like i was scared of him or anything though). Because of this it reached a point where I sat him down to explicitly say not to keep trying this on as it put me in a slightly awkward position and afterwards I'd spend the whole time before my period came worried that i was pregnant. From then on (maybe like 1.5-2 years ago) he's always used a condom without complaint.

The issue arose when we came back from a party on NYE. I'd say both of us were very drunk (we pretty much had the same amount to drink) so some of my memories are a bit blurry. We were getting intimate and initiating in quite a bit of foreplay, which was all fine. Then I'm not sure how exactly it transpired, but I was on the floor and he was about to enter (?) me. I don't know if I said anything at this point, but once he started I remember feeling worried that he hadn't put a condom on because its usually a given since i had that chat eith him. I was kind of justifying it by thinking that my period was on its way and I wasn't particularly fertile, meaning that there was a low risk of pregnancy, i was also drunk obviously so it all kind fo just happened. I do remember feeling general worry which I voiced a few times (think I said something like, you can't come, repeatedly, to which he kept saying he wasnt going to (for the record he usually does noy last long so in my head this wasnt reliable)). I also have vague memories of telling him no but also moaning, so I guess from his perspective there were mixed signals. Eventually my concern grew to the point where I had to shove him out of me and tell him to put a condom on, I distinctly remember this part. So he finished and we went to bed, I guess I woke up the next morning feeling a bit off but I disregarded it as being hungover. 

The more I've thought about it over the past few days, the more uncomfortable I've been. To the point where he realised something was wrong and pressed me to talk to him. I did and to his credit he didn't try to gaslight me or anything, his main reasoning was that he literally had no idea I felt that way (on account of the mixed signals -  he thought me saying no was like a kinky thing). He also confirmed that I had told him no (which I was wondering about as I couldn't remember everything super clearly). He said he was sorry, that he'd make it up to me, that he'd make sure nothing like this ever happened again etc etc. He did seem disturbed by it I suppose, and he said he was disgusted at himself too. He's been nothing but apologetic ever since and has said he will do anything I want for me to feel as comfortable as possible. I do think he genuinely didn't realise but obviously he should have known better.

I've just been so confused and lost because realistically this man is the love of my life and we talk about our future every day and I'd genuinely be lost without him. But I'm scared I won't be able to/don't know how to get past this. Has he really taken advantage of me, or were we both just drunk and stupid? I'm trying to be objective but I don't know whether I should write this off as a crazy mistake (after he does a lot of grovelling) or rethink things entirely. I feel like I've just started getting my life together and if we broke up I genuinely don't know how I'd recover (my family live abroad for reference). Anyway if anyone could offer some advice I'd be so so grateful. 
","I don't know whether my boyfriend (22M) took advantage of me (23F) when we were both drunk and I need advice.  I don't know exactly how this works but I've seen posts on tiktok where people have asked for advice and I really need help. I don't know if I'm meant to put some sort of warning but I will be talking about some kind of graphic sexual stuff which I will try to tone down as much as I can.

I (23F) finally moved to a new city with my boyfriend (22M) a few months ago. We've been together almost 4 years and had been desperately looking forward to this whilst doing a year of long distance. After finally finding a good job here we made the move and until the other night it's the happiest I've been in years probably. 

Some backstory before I get into what happened. My bf is super attentive and caring, he does probably more chores than me round the house to the point where I sometimes feel bad (even though I'm not necessarily lazy, he just loves things clean and orderly and also doing stuff like this to make me happy). He tells me he loves me all the time and is genuinely such a sweet person normally (my family and friends all love him) Honestly, up until now I barely have a complaint (apart from the fact that he can maybe be slightly switched off and oblivious in certain cases which kind of ties into this story i guess). Another important fact is that there was a time early on on our relationship where we wouldn't use protection during sex (literally every now and again but not often, for reference, I've never been on birth control). I think because of this he'd sometimes get a bit cocky before having sex and kind of suggest we not use protection or maybe just try and go for it until I told him no (it wasnt like i was scared of him or anything though).

14632.0,1ht4p92,post,to my rapist/ex,"hi, im 15f and I was raped last year by my ex boyfriend. I wrote this journal a little bit ago, and It really cleared my brain. I talk about my personal emotions about processing my rape for the past year and calling it what it was: rape

Dear Journal , I want to move to an island where I would have never been able to meet you. An island where I wouldn’t feel sick when someone touches me. An island where you didn’t exist. 
I would’ve never believed that when I first met you, though. Before you traumatized me, you made me feel like the most special person in the world. Like I held the world in my hands. And
I believed that for so long—- that you of anyone would never do that to me. 
My rose colored glasses were finally gone months after we broke up. I finally stopped questioning what you you did to me. You raped me. I told myself over and over again It didn’t happen  and I I was crazy… but that’s you. You are the crazy one. You are the crazy gross manipulative monster. Sometimes I still dont believe it, I ignore the ptsd, and shove it under the rug. Im embarrassed of the hurt I have to wear everyday. The hurt I will have to tell my kids about
one day so they will be nothing
like you. I’m still digging myself out of this deep hole in my head you’ve created. It’s getting better, but sometimes it still caves in and I have to heal from scratch. I hope karma finds you one day. and to anyone going through this, you are going to be okay <3","to my rapist/ex hi, im 15f and I was raped last year by my ex boyfriend.

14639.0,1ht5e3y,post,Was I(F15) assaulted by my ex-boyfriend(M16)? *Me Venting Mostly*,"Okay so this is half a vent but also just for reassurance? I already know that I can't prove anything against him or any other time I've been sexually assaulted in my 15 years so :/
Anyway I dated this guy for about three months because his best friend was dating my best friend, and y'know a bit of peer pressure and loneliness got me into a relationship. That sounds kinda bad, I actually wanted to be in the relationship lol it was just kinda peer pressure and stuff to stay in it and make to work ig. This guy was REALLY sexual, and we lost our v cards to eachother like a little over a month in. After the first time I'm talking this guy would finish four times during one fucking hangout (I didn't a single time.. :/) and we had like 3 or four a week. Anyway, like a month before I broke up with him, we were hanging out at my house and it was supposed to be a nap date. (I had started to like show a bit of distaste and pulling away from sex stuff cause it made me feel disgusting and still really does after this situation, but we made a bet with his prize being a blowjob and mine a nap date with absolutely no sex stuff, I won the bet) A couple hours into this nap day, we were like play wrestling because he was asking for sex and I was laughing (because I'm a people pleaser) but also saying no and he promised and I wasn't in the mood and asking if we can just go cuddle. Then he took the ""I'm not in the mood"" to heart and started touching my body, and my personal spots yk, to get me in the mood he said? I kept saying no and to stop, but he didn't. I couldn't stop thinking about screaming for my mom or to put a mean amount of force into getting him tf off me but I didn't wanna start something in the moment. But my body wasn't listening to my head as much and I started crying, then he stopped (woohoo ig) he got his ass off me and rolled over onto his side facing away from me and started boohooing himself. Saying he was just like (insert name of a past abuser) and I should just leave him already. This is where it doesnt look as good for me because I pushed down every feeling I had and comforted him. I hugged him and said I didn't care and I was fine. The rest of the date was just me comforting him for hours and holding him while he just kinda sat around silent and emotionless. After he left, we each told our best friends about the situation and they both sided with him and said I should work through it. That's why we dated for another month where I just kinda accepted it and let him do whatever tf he wanted to me (yes I felt disgusting). Then I dumped him because the nightmares, breakdowns, thoughts and feelings were too overwhelming. I got so much hate for it in my life. And I have absolutely not proof of this happening because I just tried to accept it. I still can't and I sound dumb cause people get raped all the time and this wasn't anything but I still can't do anything sexual in my life because of it. I feel horrible with any other person who shows interest (I haven't had sex with anyone else) and I wanna throw up even thinking about my body or touching myself. It also really fucking sucks cause I have mega daddy issues from him being shot and that makes me want male validation and for people to find me sexy.

For context, I was roofied and r*ped by my ex around 6 months ago. 

The reason I'm making this post is I don't want to get jaded and never try being with someone again. Recently (maybe a month ago), I met someone who asked me out. When we tried...messing around...I felt nauseous and literally threw up when I saw her...stuff downstairs (I don't like using explicit words, I'm weird I guess lol). 

It's almost weird to explain, I pretty much get a flashback to what happened with my ex. I could literally see her apartment, her face, etc as vividly as ever.

What can I do to just put all this crap behind me and move on as normal?

My love. Helping you is helping me. I'm going through something a little similar. Listen, when we are so innebriated that we can't even recall specifics - we are not able to consent to sex. Part of consensual sex is it being enthusiastic and more or less sober. (Of course many of us drink before sex and have sex that we wanted to have/don't feel bad about but that is not always the case).

Please don't blame yourself. He's twice your age. Twice the experience to know right from wrong and know that no means fucking no. Instead of saying you did this to yourself - remember that it takes 2 people to have sex. And think of how you would have reacted to someone repeatedly saying ""no"" and ""stop"" to you during such an intimate time. 

What I can advise you to do (instead of telling you stop the guilt that keeps arising, not very helpful is it?ha)

is to think of why you ended up in that situation to begin with. I had to do this myself and still am in the middle of it (warning: it's hard). Come at it with empathy instead of blame. There are most likely reasons why you ended up meeting this guy and asking him to go to the hotel with you. I know for my case, I realized it was a deep (and new) sense of lonliness/sadness. I've also been on a journey of self-love and acceptance lately, so this experience is extra hard to not feel guilty about. But we won't get anywhere with being mean to ourselves. I did some trauma-release yoga today, cried a little. Hope I helped - you're not alone babe."," >I got drunk, **I think**, and I asked him if he wanted to go to a hotel

My friend works in the pub and so we often go there as a friend group to hangout and they have events every week like karaoke and quizzes so it’s a popular spot. But after it happened I don’t feel safe anymore. It’s the first time since I got to uni that I haven’t felt safe. I haven’t left my apartment by myself yet and when I have left with other people I’ve just pretended like I’m fine, but I’m scared and I feel overwhelmed with panic and paranoia. 

Since we haven’t started uni up yet from the holidays I still have a couple days to try and recuperate myself more and I don’t think I’ll have a problem going to my classes during the day but if I see the man again I think I’ll have a panic attack. He was a 52 year old man and I know he lives in the area of my university campus so I’m worried I’ll see him and he’ll recognise me, even though he was really drunk when it happened. 

Another thing is that only 2/3 of my friends really know what happened and I haven’t told anyone else because I don’t know if it’s appropriate to bring up or say anything and I feel uncomfortable just telling people but I also don’t want to hide it. I looked at my university’s counselling and mental health services but I don’t think I’d ever have the actual courage to see someone about anything.

14692.0,m5bbpj3,comment,,I just say sexual assault. I can type out rape but prefer not to (it actually made me cringe typing it). Hearing it out loud makes me anxious and can be a trigger if I'm not in the best place mentally. It's not that I don't believe that's what happened to me. It's just such a direct correlation. Sexual assault is kind of an umbrella term and can be a lot of things. But r*pe just directly makes me visualize what happened and breaks my heart. I hate that that happened to me. The irony is I have also been sexually harassed/assaulted. But I never thought of them as that due to years of it being normalized and excused. So for a while I was using sexual assault in place of what it actually was, I just say sexual assault. I can type out rape but prefer not to (it actually made me cringe typing it).

The irony is I have also been sexually harassed/assaulted. But I never thought of them as that due to years of it being normalized and excused. So for a while I was using sexual assault in place of what it actually was,1.0,,2025-01-04 5:57,t3_1ht2455,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1ht2455/i_still_struggle_to_call_it_what_it_is/m5bbpj3/,Victim

14695.0,1ht8dhi,post,Sex after being SA’d,"Hi. Unfortunately I have been experiences of SA since childhood. As early as 6 and by an immediate family member. I have come to terms with those events after extensive therapy for 5 years. I had another incidence where someone locked me in their goes and tried to SA me. I was 15 then. Had another incidence at 16. Again I have coped with these. I have come to not really think about it unless I’m doing something like this. The most recent one was when I was 18. I’m 22 now. This one was by my partner at the time. He knew all this, and still didn’t take no for an answer. This one I still struggle with due to the after effects and manipulation during the break up. I worry that my current partner will leave me if I don’t do it, and he constantly reassures me. He is the greatest and let’s just say I want to marry him. I want to have sex. But I’m constantly stressing and worrying. Part of it is living up to whatever expectations he could have, like my ex did. He always reassures me he has no expectations. And another part is wanting to do it and just not knowing how. 

I feel like a 12yr old again finding out about the birds and the bees. Even though I’ve done it before consensually, I feel like I’m experiencing it for the first time. I wonder how do people have sex even though I know already. I just don’t understand it, but want it at the same time. I have a sex drive but I just don’t know how. I don’t think I’ve explained this very well, but hopefully the point comes across a little bit. 

Has anyone felt this? What did you do to help? ","Sex after being SA’d Hi. Unfortunately I have been experiences of SA since childhood. As early as 6 and by an immediate family member.

14701.0,1ht97z3,post,Idk how to cope,"I was in an abusive relationship where saying no was not an option. I think after that, I became a shut in. I was severely depressed and wanted to die. Now, I’m still depressed but I’m living. 

I think I’m a hermit. I don’t take care of myself. I don’t eat well. I don’t go out unless it’s with family. I feel like a child even though I’m an adult. 

I feel like what happened to me will stay with me. It’s been years since I escaped and I just can’t get over it. I know I’ll never get my justice. I know I should just be normal, so why can’t I? 

I’ve developed really bad habits as well. I often romanticize my rape. I know it’s not true but I think it’s romantic sometimes that he loved me so much he’d do anything to have me. I know it’s a lie and I’d never get back with him. I’ve also fantasized about being raped again and even went out without a bra once but I know I’d actually be terrified and cry and want to die if it happened so why would I fantasize about that? 

I think redpill content is also bad for my mental health. Some say men are biologically designed to rape while women are biologically designed to be raped and accept objectification. I don’t want that to be true but why am I the way that I am? 

I want to be loved but deep down I’m terrified of men. I’m terrified of being vulnerable again. I’m terrified of trusting people. I’m unable to open up and grow strong bonds so I just stay inside and dream. I dream of being beautiful and cherished and loved but I can’t face my fears so it’s just a dream.

I can’t get therapy because i wouldn’t want my family to know and I live with them and o get no privacy in this house. Writing my feelings works and venting to people helps but I also worry that I’m so damn annoying and i should shut up already. Sometimes it feels like only those bad men who get off to it are the only ones who really want to help. 

I’m incredibly lonely and idk how to change my life to be better. How to build friendships? How to build confidence? I’m also a freezer when I’m scared. It’s hard for me to be a fighter.

My (19F) girlfriend (18F (trans)) had repressed memories of being SAd by their cousin. She was 11-12 at the time, and her cousin was a year older. It happened multiple times, and she thinks she's partly at fault for it (although from what she's told me she was pressered a lot and most likely manipulated). We were talking earlier today and a thing that was brought up made her think of it, and she like suddenly realized. She knew something has happened with her cousin but didn't remember until today any of the details (like the fact that she was most likely manipulated into it). She says her memory is still blurry, and I haven't pushed for any details in any way and I've just let her say what she feels she needs to say about it/what would be helpful to her if she said it kinda thing. We're long distance, so I wasn't physically touching her (which I would not have done without specific permission after being told, but we would've been cuddling before and when she realized). 

I've just been telling her that it isn't her fault, and that it's absolutely discusstioning someone would do that to a child, even another child, and that everything she's feels and wants right now is completely ok and valid, and that I'll support her in any way I can, and that I still love her and see her as the most amazing person on the planet. She said she feels disgusted and feels like she's gonna throw up. She told me first but then also told a few friends. She still lives with her parents and wants to tell them but doesn't know how they'll react.

I just don't know what I can do to help. She's told me she doesn't want to be touched by anyone in any way for now (which in our case means telling each other if we were together we'd be hugging kinda thing) and I'm obviously gonna respect that. I genuinely love her with every fiber of my being and want to do anything I possibly can to help her.

As of now I'm continuing to tell her I love her and she's said it back many times. She also said she appreciates that I'm here for her, and I'll continue being there for her as much as I physically can.
All of what I've been doing so far is a combination or what seems right, what she's told me, and things I've heard in passing as to what can help/things that characters in a few books I've read that talk about it do.

I'd truly appreciate and and all advice on how I can help. ","My girlfriend just rediscovered repressed memories of her cousin SAing them. I need advice on how to help her I don't know for sure this is a good place to put this. I myself am not a victim but I'm willing to do anything to help my girlfriend who is.

My (19F) girlfriend (18F (trans)) had repressed memories of being SAd by their cousin. She was 11-12 at the time, and her cousin was a year older. It happened multiple times, and she thinks she's partly at fault for it (although from what she's told me she was pressered a lot and most likely manipulated).

14745.0,1htbell,post,I really hate how I'm coping,"(It happened when I was 5)

I've told this to people I trust, I vent from time to time, but nothing seems to work. My mind just repeats it whenever I have nothing on my mind, I have the feelings of those moments again, and it's disgusting because in my body it feels good, but I feel total disgust. I know it's normal, I know that's how the body reacts, I don't feel guilty about it, but it's difficult because every time I feel that way about something else my mind relates those feelings to my abuse. It's horrible not being able to enjoy myself because it's always there, because I never stop feeling abused every time.

I also increasingly realize how hypersexual I became. I was watching p0rn since I was 8, it just disturbs me to know that I was doing that in my childhood, that was what I thought and wanted when I was just a child, that I never really had a childhood that I could enjoy. I'm a little uncomfortable thinking about myself in a sexual way right now, I sometimes joke about it, in that stupid adolescent way so to speak, it's only really uncomfortable when I think about it seriously. I don't know how to feel about that.

I also have a lot of doubts about my sexuality, I currently have a girlfriend, I really love her and I can confirm my attraction to girls, but with men it is strange, it's pretty easy for me to find myself sexually attracted to them, but I've only fallen romantically in love with one. Also, I will have the honest observation, when I have sexual fantasies with men I always end up in a submissive role, otherwise it probably doesn't feel as good, it's disturbing because many times it doesn't even seem consensual, even if I'm imagining it, even if I want it, it's like I want to live that again and that just for once it feels good. At the same time, I am unable to maintain any physical contact with men, it is totally strange and disturbing to me that the consequences of my abuse are so deeply rooted in me.

Sometimes I don't know what to do with myself, in my situation I find it extremely difficult to get therapy, in addition to that hypersexual response in me there are also those totally traumatized ones, that make me want to disintegrate from my existence, burn me, crush my bones, disappear completely to never be touched again, I seriously feel so terrible and I don't know what to do. I know I have a problem, that it's not my fault, but I feel so powerless to solve it.","I really hate how I'm coping (It happened when I was 5)

14748.0,1htbp86,post,I gave myself false rape trauma ,"I (f19) accidentally traumatized myself

I finally met my boyfriend IRL in December, and I'm a virgin. We met online and I really love him. We met IRL and it went very well, everything went great.

I wanted to lose my virginity to him in that time, but I was really nervous (which I assume is normal). I have bad anxiety issues, and so I took some THC to mellow myself out, thinking it would make it easier when I wasn't as stressed. 

We were going to do it, but I panicked last second and now I can't think about sex without being brought back to it. I can still feel him pressed against me and it makes me sick. 

I'm not ace. I don't know my problem. 

Nothing is his fault, I told him yes multiple times, but he decided against it because I was too scared and high. I don't blame him at all and he did nothing wrong. 

We're still dating and very much love each other.

I feel really fucking bad, and I don't know what's wrong with me. I feel like I disappointed him because I couldn't do it. I thought I was ready. I really thought I was. 

And I know this isn't rape but I don't even know where to go. What do I even do? ","I gave myself false rape trauma  I (f19) accidentally traumatized myself

14756.0,1htcjf6,post,I think i’m remembering and I don’t know if i want to. ,"I’ve always been weird around sex, honestly quite disgusted by the whole thing. I cut off friends who dared to even mention sex in middle school. I slowly got better with the subject but still felt (and still do) extremely embarrassed anytime it comes up even with close friends of the same sex.

About 6-8 months ago my partner told me they had been assaulted as a child. I supported them ofc but afterwards i felt really strange and tense. I had a full on freeze, couldn’t move, felt petrified, kinda ptsd esc episode. 
I remembered reaching into a mans pants and feeling all of *it* and whatever. I remembered the feeling of his jeans agains my arm and how guilty and confused i was. I would have been very young. 

One thing that was confusing and hard to process is I remembered “remembering it” before when i was in 6-7th grade. I remember it being the middle of the night on a bad insomnia night and remembering that same memory. Breaking down on my bed and crying and shaking and asking myself over and over “why”, “why do i remember that” “ive never done that”

I don’t remember who did it and it has been killing me for months now. I talked to my therapist and my closest friend about it all (I’ve also vaguely mentioned it to my partner recently during a breakdown). 

i still kinda feel like i’m just crazy? I always kinda suspected in the back of my head but never really let that thought be real. 

Two weeks ago the memory popped back up, along with a face.. my fucking aunts ex husband who i was absolutely terrified of and could never give a reason for why. I recall full on SPRINTING away from him one of the times he visited and i hid in a closet till he left. I was terrified and i didn’t even know why, I just had to be away from this man immediately. 

I still don’t have any more clear memories of what happened, just this sickening gut feeling when i think abt that man, my “uncle r”. The only other thing that came back was vague images of this house in the middle of the forest, a pb&j he gave me, and these thoughts “why are we doing this” “this isn’t a kids game, this isn’t what kids do”, and just general confusion, guilt, and shame. 

I don’t know what to do, i still feel like i’m crazy and want to cram it all back in my head.  I was assaulted twice as a teenager and still have barely begun to process those incidents and now this. 

Im having almost constant ptsd episodes from every traumatic thing i can think of for weeks now including all of this. I just want it all to stop. Im considering inpatient care (i think thats the word) if this doesn’t get easier to deal with soon bc i don’t know how much longer I can take this, i’m at the end of my rope now. 

Just keep asking why? and what if im wrong? what if im crazy? but also the scarier question of what if it is all real? can i even handle that.

14758.0,1htcn0v,post,just sharing my experience/want confirmation for stuff that happened,"Hi!! im currently only 12 years old and just wanted to talk about my experience. This happened not even a year ago, and i still attend school with the person. 

just around when i turned 11, around october 2023, i had met this person, they were alternative like me and it seemed really cool to have a person i shared interests. They were and are a grade above me currently (about 2 years older, currently 14). 

I remember when we became friends it was like we instantly clicked, we went to the movies, and i had invited them to come trick or treating with one of my other friends. Where we had all clicked, though at this point (or somewhere around) things started getting very weird. I remember after halloween we had sexted, and he has started sharing personal things with such as kinks, and masturbation. the second time we hung out at my house i remember specfically that we had started cuddling (this was around november, we had barely known each other for a month), by the 3rd or 4th time we had watched porn. i dont remember how it got brought up to watch it, and by this point its not something i had ever seen, and i guess the excitment of ""maturing"" was enough for be to not think about how fucking weird this was

at some point he had started kissing my neck and saying i love you to me, i felt that my self confidence was kinda relying on him and i was becoming a hollow shell of who i was before. and it wasnt even that we connected well in our interests anymore, all our conversations were about what we called the ""gay sex"" that would happen in my room. if it wasnt that, our only conversation starter was ""what are you doing""

i dont know when this started happening but i started feeling distanced with friends i used to be close to. Me and him never had a day where we didnt talk, till of course the end of our ""friendship"". He started talking about his jealousy issues and how he was really clingy, and so many people had left him or betrayed him in the past. (i dont remember when this exactly happened) but an example of his jealousy was when me and him alone were supposed to go to some store together, i had ended up hanging out with one of my friends that i dearly appreciate so much to this day before hand, and didnt wanna leave them on such short notice, so i invited them to come with me and him. we'll refer the ig abuser as S, my actual friends is C. So S had by the way invited his brother along who i hadnt known so i wasnt that comfortable (even more reason to invite C). And honestly i had fun! not because of S, but because of C, he had made me so much more comfortable and happy there. but after everyone had gone home i had gotten a text from S, stating that he didnt want me to invite any of my friends to any hangouts we were doing, because HE felt awkward and uncomfortable. at the time, i had understood this, but looking back, it just seems very weird to me. 

At my house i had realized i wanted to be a guy, i felt even more uncomfortable with my body but S kept talking about how his ass was bigger, my tits could be bigger, i just wanna remind people I WAS ELEVEN, why should this matter? this personally just made me even more uncomfortable with myself. at the time i played into it, what was i supposed to say? i didnt wanna make it awkward. 

Around february last year, he had broken up with his partner, who i think he stills sees as the ""bad person"" even though i can totally understand their perspective (the partners). basically they had started dating around 11 years old, but had just become distant with each other. (around this time also we had started fucking kissing and getting more disgusting in my room) And to him, i just wanna say that sure you guys grew apart BECAUSE YOU HAD DIFFERENT INTERESTS how is it there fault they cant talk to you when youre so fucking boring, and your only thing to talk about is school drama. i could barely hold a 5 minunte conversation with him. i remember after the breakup i was also sobbing because me and him had talked about that we should stop going to my house for activities, i shouldve taken the fucking oppurtunity, i shouldve, but i had started relying on it so much, it gave me confidence, who gives a fuck if i felt empty afterwords, i felt cared, i felt like i had someone to trust, why would i give that up (by the way, i had started having doubts and panic attacks around december because of those activities) 

after they had broken up, things had just gotten worse, i had started getting hickeys from him, he had started pulling my hair, slapping my ass, all of course in my room, he cant have anybody knowing about this.... under pressure i had done these things back, it felt right in the moment. he wouldnt stop when i was flinching, when i was shaking, when i went quiet and just wanted to sit there, when i felt very over stimulated and he would just continue slapping my fucking ass. i remember everytime he would my hair, it hurt, it hurt really fucking badly, but i coudlnt just start sobbing, i could get away from his face if he had me grabbed by my hair, pulling me towards him. 

i remember at some point after, on a thursday, after he left, i made a pity attempt to kill myself, i  was just gonna take anough pills to kill me, thankfully i didnt succeed. I had woken up the next day just feeling like absolute shit, but alive, i had tried to tell him about it, though i had just joked about it, but really i wanted to talk to something, i didnt know when i tried to kill myself until months later, (kinda weird, but i hadnt thought of S as a bad person, and all the reasons i attempted were derived from him, though i had refused to believe it.) i just wanted to talk to someone.

more stuff started happening in my room, at some point he had started asking me for consent to do stuff (an example would be touching my private parts, he touched my tits with his bare hands, and my lower stuff with his leg) i had started hinting at him, talking to him about the age of consent, and how minors cant consent as they dont understand the difference between wanting something and horniness, at some point i had told him, if i say i consent, i dont mean it, i dont consent, he continued to touch me

another thing that showed his kinda jealosy was that at school during lunch and break, i could barely talk to my other friends, because S felt to fucking jealous when i talked to anybody else, but of course he could talk to his other friends and there was absolutely no problem with that. everytime one of my oter friends went up to me i had to push them back, i couldnt talk to them at all, or that would hurt his precious little feelings

i know i have missed a lot of stuff, but bare with me when youre getting assulted most days of the week you tend to block stuff out.

kinda present day !!

it had all stopped when i straight up told him how i felt, not in detail of course, i couldnt hurt his fragile little feelings that are above all else to much, he apologized, but i said we could continue to be friends. did i forgive him? fuck no. did i give him a second chance? i guess. 

it was fine, school hadnt started again yet, but i wasnt talking to him, he wasnt talking to me, we didnt have much to talk about after all ""gay sex"" was over, but i remember getting a text messege from him, that said something along the lines of me coloring my lower parts the colors of the trans flag, i know it was a joke, but really, to him, youre gonna say that? youre gonna say that to someone you have left traumatized for there life at the age of 11. thats what youre gonna say? you couldnt have thought about it? you couldnt have never said that? because that weird to say in any fucking context. 

i told them that made me super uncomfortable, and i wish i could say i never talked to them again, i never saw them again, but we go to the same school, what could i do? and i had his shirt left at my house, i had to fucking give them that. 

he has a pinterest account, with a self titled board, ive started checking it and it really disgusts me, from those pins, you can tell he somehow made himself into the victim, with pins such as ""i knew they were bad for me but i still think about them"" ""i wish to never forget the sound of his voice"" and things if put into the perspective of my situation are just disgusting 

everytime i see him, or even think about him, i start having a panic attack, but he didnt really care about that even when we were friends.","just sharing my experience/want confirmation for stuff that happened Hi!! im currently only 12 years old and just wanted to talk about my experience.

more stuff started happening in my room, at some point he had started asking me for consent to do stuff (an example would be touching my private parts, he touched my tits with his bare hands, and my lower stuff with his leg) i had started hinting at him, talking to him about the age of consent, and how minors cant consent as they dont understand the difference between wanting something and horniness, at some point i had told him, if i say i consent, i dont mean it, i dont consent, he continued to touch me

another thing that showed his kinda jealosy was that at school during lunch and break, i could barely talk to my other friends, because S felt to fucking jealous when i talked to anybody else, but of course he could talk to his other friends and there was absolutely no problem with that. everytime one of my oter friends went up to me i had to push them back, i couldnt talk to them at all, or that would hurt his precious little feelings

i know i have missed a lot of stuff, but bare with me when youre getting assulted most days of the week you tend to block stuff out.

kinda present day !!

it had all stopped when i straight up told him how i felt, not in detail of course, i couldnt hurt his fragile little feelings that are above all else to much, he apologized, but i said we could continue to be friends. did i forgive him? fuck no. did i give him a second chance? i guess. 

it was fine, school hadnt started again yet, but i wasnt talking to him, he wasnt talking to me, we didnt have much to talk about after all ""gay sex"" was over, but i remember getting a text messege from him, that said something along the lines of me coloring my lower parts the colors of the trans flag, i know it was a joke, but really, to him, youre gonna say that? youre gonna say that to someone you have left traumatized for there life at the age of 11. thats what youre gonna say? you couldnt have thought about it? you couldnt have never said that? because that weird to say in any fucking context. 

i told them that made me super uncomfortable, and i wish i could say i never talked to them again, i never saw them again, but we go to the same school, what could i do? and i had his shirt left at my house, i had to fucking give them that. 

he has a pinterest account, with a self titled board, ive started checking it and it really disgusts me, from those pins, you can tell he somehow made himself into the victim, with pins such as ""i knew they were bad for me but i still think about them"" ""i wish to never forget the sound of his voice"" and things if put into the perspective of my situation are just disgusting 

everytime i see him, or even think about him, i start having a panic attack, but he didnt really care about that even when we were friends.",0.0,1.0,2025-01-04 11:36,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1htcn0v/just_sharing_my_experiencewant_confirmation_for/,Neutral

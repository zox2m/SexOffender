Second of all, don’t end it. Get outside in the sun and fresh air every day. 

Start tomorrow. 

Wake up and watch the sun rise outside, then walk around and say hi to strangers. 

Do some exercise. 

Then watch the sunset and eat your favorite meal. 

Listen to your favorite music. 

Create something (art, music, writing, building something, etc…) go help someone who needs it. 

And again, go meet new people. 

All of these things will make you feel so much better and grateful you get to enjoy life with us all.

But nobody really made plans specifically to celebrate. It wasn't malicious, or mean spirited... It just wasn't a big deal to any of us, so nobody ma

-Some folks don't like reminders they are getting older. Birthdays are sometimes avoided by some people.

-Not everyone likes Coldplay. And thats okay. Go to the show solo, and connect with some fellow fans! It sounds like others in this thread (if they live close enough) would go with you!

-After you hit a certain age, making plans becomes increasingly difficult... Work, kids, spouses, errands, projects, etc.
From personal experience, if I didn't make plans with several weeks notice, and put it in my calendar... There's a 99% chance I'm not doing it. I got way too much stuff on my plate.

I say this for two solid experiences. Once, I purchased three Usher concert tickets and had to sell a single ticket online because one friend backed out . I did not expect it to sell, but it did. This woman shows up by herself, and she is dancing and singing alone, having a wonderful time. After a while, my friend and I talked to her. She said nobody she knew wanted to attend the concert. A couple of days prior, she decided to go on her own and found the ticket I put on sale. It was cheaper than expected in prime location better than the tickets she was going to get for her friends if they wanted to attend. She made new friends and had the time of her life. She said she made the choice to live life and be happy for herself and not wait for anybody to do something. 

My friend and I went to a Bruno Mars concert over 10 years ago. At that time, we were in our mid-20s. We had isle seats number 1 and 2. The isle to our left had an older couple in their 50s. The concert starts and we are singing and dancing and so is the lady to the left of us. The man she is with is not having a good time and has a sour face. This woman left her guy, walked across the stairs to our isle, and joined us in singing and dancing. She said her husband only came out of obligation and was making the experience horrible for her. After she saw us, she decided to enjoy the concert with other Bruno Mars fans. We became friends, and she thanked us for making her concert experience fun and memorable. 

The point is you can have fun going by yourself and making friends. You can also go with someone who is not going to enjoy it and make it miserable. In that case, go, have fun, and let loose with friends who like the same music."," Happy birthday! Please don't do something that is permanent for a temporary situation or feeling.

I say this for two solid experiences. Once, I purchased three Usher concert tickets and had to sell a single ticket online because one friend backed out . I did not expect it to sell, but it did. This woman shows up by herself, and she is dancing and singing alone, having a wonderful time. After a while, my friend and I talked to her. She said nobody she knew wanted to attend the concert. A couple of days prior, she decided to go on her own and found the ticket I put on sale. It was cheaper than expected in prime location better than the tickets she was going to get for her friends if they wanted to attend. She made new friends and had the time of her life. She said she made the choice to live life and be happy for herself and not wait for anybody to do something. 

My friend and I went to a Bruno Mars concert over 10 years ago. At that time, we were in our mid-20s. We had isle seats number 1 and 2. The isle to our left had an older couple in their 50s. The concert starts and we are singing and dancing and so is the lady to the left of us. The man she is with is not having a good time and has a sour face. This woman left her guy, walked across the stairs to our isle, and joined us in singing and dancing. She said her husband only came out of obligation and was making the experience horrible for her. After she saw us, she decided to enjoy the concert with other Bruno Mars fans. We became friends, and she thanked us for making her concert experience fun and memorable. 

The point is you can have fun going by yourself and making friends. You can also go with someone who is not going to enjoy it and make it miserable. In that case, go, have fun, and let loose with friends who like the same music.",1,,2025-01-17 21:04:23,t3_1i3oqiz,,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1i3oqiz/todays_my_28_birthday_and_i_am_going_to_end_it/m7p0f52/,Neutral

Circumstances change and things do actually get better but I for one totally understand how it can all feel like too much to deal with. I went to therapy, started cooking more and actually started going on little walks just to get used to being with myself,  it by myself.

You’re not alone in this world bro. My dad hasnt even called me to tell me happy birthday and i know he wont cause he probably doesnt remember and thats ok. Ive learned over the years that people texting and posting me on my birthday means less and less to me and ive found comfort in not going out at all or thinking that i need to do something for my birthday.

24395,m7p3jnq,comment,,"First of all @OP thank you for sharing this. It takes courage to open up like this especially when you feel the way you do atm. Youre willingness to express your feelings shows lotta strength even if it may not feel that way for you now!!

I can imagine how much pain and loneliness you’re carrying.. Feeling forgotten or rejected by the people you care about just does rlly suck, and it’s okay to acknowledge that!! But I want you to know this: your worth isn’t defined by the number of birthday wishes you get or how others treat you. Youre real value only lies in who you are—and we’re really all unique and a one of a kind special individuals. 

They sey were hardwired for connection, but connection requires courage to be seen! And you, by sharing your story, you’re reaching out for connection. That’s no something a “terrible person” would do. It’s a sign of a kind heart that wants to feel understood. We all do. 

Please remember: how you feel right now dont define your future life! Life can change in unexpected and beautiful ways, even when it feels impossible to imagine. As the old saying goes, “This too shall pass.” The heaviness of this moment is not forever ;)

Here are a few thoughts from I’d like to share with you:
	1.	You are not your thoughts. The belief that you’re “not good enough” or “terrible” is just that—a belief, not a fact. Your thoughts might feel overwhelming, but they don’t define who you are. As Eckhart Tolle says, “You are not the voice in your head. You are the awareness behind it.”
	2.	Comparison steals your joy. It’s easy to compare yourself to others—their lives, their successes, their relationships. But comparison blinds you to your own value and unique path. As Theodore Roosevelt wisely said, “Comparison is the thief of joy.” Your journey is yours alone, and it doesn’t need to look like anyone else’s.
	3.	Small connections can make a big difference. It might feel like no one cares, but sometimes people don’t realize someone needs help. Reaching out—even with a simple “How are you?”—can lead to unexpected kindness. Connection doesn’t have to be grand; it can start small.
	4.	You don’t have to go through this alone. Talk to someone you trust or reach out to a professional. There’s no shame in asking for help—in fact, it’s one of the bravest things you can do. Nelson Mandela once said, “Courage is not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it.” You don’t have to carry this weight by yourself.

Finally, I want you to know this: you are so much more than your achievements, your appearance, or the way others treat you. You are a person with emotions, dreams, and value. Don’t let these difficult moments define your story. If you stay, if you give life another chance, the future can surprise you in ways you can’t yet see.

Take today as a small step toward a new chapter. And remember: “Even the darkest night will end, and the sun will rise.” (Victor Hugo).

You matter, and I hope you can hold on to that truth, even if it feels distant right now.

So.. Happy birthday, stranger!!! And hey they might not be calls, but bet you got you more birthday wishes and tags already than most of the people on your social media. Hahah I respect you man. Just carry on. I haven’t been celebrating last year and didn’t even care. About 4 people congratulated me in total. Whatever lol!"," First of all @OP thank you for sharing this.

I have hyperhidrosis. Excessive sweating. Lovely disorder. My hands, armpits, legs, back. Everywhere sweats. 

I’m 60 now and today the weather is 56°. I’m upstairs getting ready for date day with hubby. LOL!  I’m A tad overweight. But, I ain’t ugly. I’ve got blonde hair and green eyes. An old grandmother now.

My 32 yr old son is living with me. He caught his wife cheating. In the ACT. Anyway. He had no job. She fired him. He was the chef where they worked. She worked the bar. He has no car. No house. No children. 

He’s an alcoholic. I did not know. We (1st and 2nd hubby) never drank. We are strong churchgoers. Strong faith in God. My son had an emergency gallbladder surgery. Surgeon saw he had complete cirrhosis of the liver. He is dying.   He needs a liver transplant. He’s been in the ICU for two months before Christmas. He’s been home a month. He’s 6’2” tall.

I’m overwhelmed right now.

I’ve attempted suicide when I first became disabled and not able to teach anymore. Thank God I failed!

I thought she was just as busy as I was, and had no idea she was in such a dark place. Of course when she passed we were all devastated. Her funeral was one of the biggest I'd ever seen.

If I'd had known, I would have much rather taken time off work to go and visit her and spend time together than to have had to take time off work to attend her funeral. 

I guess what I'm saying is that you are loved, but people get busy, so it's up to you to reach out to them and let them know how you are feeling. I bet that when you do, they will drop everything and run to you. If they don't, they're not the right people, and you might need to find new friends.

I'm one of those people that don't do alot so don't take that part to heart to much because some of them are probably as well. 2, on the other hand if I had a friend that told me no one else would do anything with them, I would for sure but I've been by myself for many a celebration so I get it. If ones you thought were friends aren't even attempting then they are not what you thought. But don't fret, you do you, just keep trying. All you can do is make an effort but when that doesn't succeed just ignore them. That creates an air of mystic and eventually it will pay off.

I may not have lived your exact life or have gone through exactly what you have but I understand how you’re feeling.

I can tell you it’s so worth it fighting until the next day. Now I'm better, I got out of 8 years of depression. It really gets better, I never would’ve imagined how much better it can get. When you are better, everything is easier, doing small things doesn’t cost you as much, you find beauty in life, you get the power to fight for your beliefs and know when to step out, and you stop feeling like a monster. I, too, had the feeling that there was a bouncing ball in my head, which gave me dark thoughts every time it bounced, harder, and harder. 
You are going through a very rough patch, and special dates and difficult context bring out more difficult emotions. 
Please reach out,  ask for help: you can call a suicide hotline, go to a hospital/psychiatric emergencies, take an appointment with a psychiatrist and a therapist if you haven’t got one yet.


Something that might give a meaning to your life could be to adopt a pet: thanks to you, they’ll get to have a nice life, loved and cared for, and depending on how your country laws work, you might even save their life! Plus, it’s nice to have a loving creature by your side.

You don’t deserve to end your life. You deserve love and joy, and you will get it. The pain you're feeling is real, crushing and unfair -- you don’t deserve to feel like this, but the good thing is, it gets better, really. I hope you'll get to feel some sun on your face today, feel its warmth inside you, the light flicker and you get to breath the pain out -- it might be a few seconds of relief, but trust me: you'll get to a point where your whole life feels like this relief

Life is great and enjoying it with other people can be fun, but having fun by yourself can be meditative. It can also be a lot easier to control. 
Painters, writers, musicians, a lot of things that can bring people happiness are solo ventures for the most part. You also never have to worry about someone else being in a bad mood, or ""not getting it""


When you truly learn to have fun by yourself, and believe in yourself, it is more attractive to other people. So don't worry about them.


Life is so massive and has so much going on. Some friends not going to see coldplay is such a small thing, and it would be a shame to end yourself over something so small.


Go travel. See another country. Traverse a jungle. Join a movement.  Save an endangered animal.  Something.

Vitiligo is really cool imo.

I wanted this car really bad, and ended up not getting it. Or the promotion I wanted. Me and my girl were going through it, and I ended up more broke than I was.

Life operates in waves. Some days it’ll be good, some days it’ll suck. Some events hurt more than others. But as long as life goes on, life goes on.

It was a woman I really liked in February of last year. She was single, I wasn’t where I needed to be financially at that moment, and I… didn’t shoot my shot. She moved to California a few months ago and got married. 

Now, while this is a missed shot for me, there also other women I’m interested in. This also shows how fast she was able to find someone and how fast her now partner was able to find someone.

My mentor was homeless a decade ago and now has millions (real estate and stocks).

Life… just goes on, but only if you let it.

Own that shit. Whatever your problems are, whatever you’re facing, don’t let that define you. Because you’re more than the sum of your problems, there’s a whole side of you that’s also wonderful and worth bragging about, yet is hiding behind a shy exterior,  I’m sure of it.

And with that said. Since you wanna kill yourself anyways, I’ll challenge you to a quick lil side quest — treat yourself like the “main character”. Get some new outfits, workout, learn something and indulge in your hobbies. Something’s gonna click, and it won’t be that of failure, trust me.

Of coure you may have already tried these things but thats just my advice. All the best and I believe in your inner power and strength.

It affected her life for many years.

And I think she is perfect and beautiful just the way she is!! I don’t even see her vitiligo when I look at her! She is my beautiful mama and she has beautiful artwork all over her body. 

Over the years her vitiligo has spread to where her face is now all completely without pigment and evened out. where it was the worst on her legs it’s spread more to where it blends in more now that the pigment is mostly gone in those areas. It’s taken her many years to be able to look past her “differences” and acknowledge that she IS perfect just the way she is! I have ALWAYS stood up for her and if I ever heard anyone (adult or child) say anything about her vitiligo—you better believe I was the first one to speak up and quiet them up right away! 

It hurts me to see people treated differently because of conditions, ailments and just looking/being “different”.   PLEASE know that YOU ARE LOVED!!! YOU ARE SPECIAL, YOU ARE IMPORTANT & YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL & PERFECT JUST THE WAY YOU ARE!!! And you would be terribly missed if you left this world. 🥺

Till today nobody holds power to hurt me. Only one can hurt me is my mind and what I think.
You are a brave and good soul

I hope you'll reconsider leaving the world behind. Trust me when I say that there are so many people who would be immensely hurt by losing you. I myself am terrible at making plans, but that is simply because I am a mess! Fell into a depression (got the official diagnosis in March 2024 and begun medication and therapy) after my father was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer late summer of 2023 and I am barely hanging in there still. 
(My father is thankfully in remission and hopefully will be declared cancer free in a couple of years - he was a trooper in both surgery and chemo)

I am still trying to land on my feet, and I would bet money on that your family and friends have a particularly rough time themselves and are distracted. It's not an excuse, but it is a reason. I hope it can give you comfort.

Also - and this is my personal opinion as a 33F - your best years come after 30. I hope you'll be here for another lap around the sun, and never forget that a stranger is just a friend you haven't met yet. Had I been in India, I would've gone to the concert with you."," Happy 28th birthday!

After college, I noticed it is difficult to make friends. Heck, most I don't even want to hang with outside the activity I meet them from. It's not because I dislike them. I oddly enjoy being alone. If I could give you a bit of that part of me, I would.

Hopefully, this post is just a cry for help, and some needed attention. Keep going on! Life could be 20x better in a year or 5, you never know. 

Then, hopes with improving your current situation, I have the following advice. Look into getting a pet! They will show you how much love and appreciation they have for you. Even having fish or a turtle, just knowing you are their person, providing them food can be fulfilling for the soul.

Do you have any hobbies or interests outside of work? I fish and you'd think it would be pretty solitary, but holy cow I meet a lot of people. When I salt water fish on a pier, I end up socializing and making buddies I see whenever I go out. I haven't made any best friends, but it fullfills my social needs.

After college, I noticed it is difficult to make friends. Heck, most I don't even want to hang with outside the activity I meet them from. It's not because I dislike them. I oddly enjoy being alone. If I could give you a bit of that part of me, I would.

I bet you're not a terrible person. You would have to do some wild shit for me to think that. 

Hopefully, this post is just a cry for help, and some needed attention. Keep going on! Life could be 20x better in a year or 5, you never know. 

Then, hopes with improving your current situation, I have the following advice. Look into getting a pet! They will show you how much love and appreciation they have for you. Even having fish or a turtle, just knowing you are their person, providing them food can be fulfilling for the soul.

Do you have any hobbies or interests outside of work? I fish and you'd think it would be pretty solitary, but holy cow I meet a lot of people. When I salt water fish on a pier, I end up socializing and making buddies I see whenever I go out. I haven't made any best friends, but it fullfills my social needs.

I gather you’re near Ahmedabad, India. So hopefully some people from there are down to connect.

Suicide is very serious and will impact your family and friends for a very long time - they will likely never forgive themselves. The people that said no to your birthday offer will probably think they solely caused your death.

It sounds like a combination of things leading to depression. Your ex getting married is going to be a big one, and your reaction to her announcing sounds completely understandable and normal. It hurt you to hear that, you don’t need to pretend it doesn’t.
You also had an underwhelming birthday because no one really called. I’ve had a lonely birthday like that after a pretty major breakup, so I get it. 
Also, stop using social media as a gauge for how much people care. it’s curated to make people seem popular - they likely message their birthday friend asking if they can post certain photos of them (because they like how they look in the photo of them).

The best advice I’ve heard is to put suicide off a day, and then put it off another day…you can always do it ‘tomorrow.’ Try to do stuff you like, learn to enjoy your own company without others.

I’ve also never understood why people don’t try the million other options they have before suicide. To me, it’s more logical to quit your job and start backpacking in Brazil than to end your entire life. It’s more logical to try to do just about anything before even considering suicide.

I also imagine that the friend that turned the Coldplay tickets down must have had something big come up, or they’re struggling with something too. Who would give those hard to get tickets up for nothing?"," I’m sorry man!

I Can't be there but honestly you need to tell me how good the concert is.  You have loads of people wanting to come and see it with you.

Sometimes in life people get busy, really busy and it doesn't mean they don't care its just life don't take it to heart.  We always take advantage and never appreciate the good stuff and people until they are gone.

What makes you different makes you beautiful.  Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. I did a whole photography project of beauty how it's perceived.

As I always say fix up, look sharp.

Honestly I hope your OK.  I hope u manage to read this and smile."," I never usually post but happy birthday.  My daughters birthday was other day, January birthdays are special.

It sucks when people forget your birthday, my husband and kids and family all forgot mine last year. I was a MESS. I was very hurt. But I let them know that, and we talked, and eventually, the hurt went away. But it is an absolutely terrible feeling, and I’m so sorry that happened to you. 

I was very connected to your post in particular, because we are very similar, I empathize with your pain, and I am so very sorry you feel and are going through what you are. 

Don’t leave. You have impacted so many people more positively than you will ever know. I finally decided to start going to therapy recently, at 32 years old, because I couldn’t take it anymore. I was in so much pain, went into psychosis, and almost destroyed my life over pain within a few weeks, I let it consume me. But, everyday, it gets a teeny tiney bit better. You’re strong, I can tell. If you weren’t you wouldn’t have wrote this. You sound like a very genuinely kind soul, and we need a lot more people like you in the world.

Usually when I see junk food, I just think “why not? It doesn’t matter anyway.“ But now I know that I can save peoples lives, but eating healthy and taking care of myself.

Maybe you just haven’t found the right people to be around, you don’t have to fight for people to be with you, just wait for the right one to come. 
But what I think the most important thing is to learn to be alone and enjoy it. Be with yourself. 
Don’t let yourself be convinced by the media that being around a bunch of people its the only way to be happy, or enjoy things. 
Know yourself first, thats how you are going to be able to know what kind of person you are and what kind of people you want around you. 
For example the users offering to go with you to the concert!! Let yourself do something new. Don’t overthink it just go!! You have something to look forward for a couple of days. Take it like that day by day. 
I went to the concert back in 2023 and im not even a fan of them hahaha I learned the set list just to sign along and I really enjoyed it, as you said is your favourite band you are going to enjoy it a lot!   

Even if you go alone to the concert, go for yourself, do it for yourself. There is nothing wrong or weird with going alone to places.

It seems you have a very caring and compassionate soul, and that’s a tough burden to bear when you don’t get the same energy in return. The world needs people like you, and it would be missing something beautiful if you left.

I understand your feelings all too well. When I was in my late 20s, I was at a very low point.

I’m 31 now and that relationship did fail, I did lose some friendships, but I’ve also learned more about myself and have experienced new things. I told my family how I was feeling and what I was going through and they started showing up for me too as a result, they hadn’t known how bad my mental health had gotten.

24704,m7puzdb,comment,,"It is personal to an extent. That's why it hurts your feelings. 

The younger generations are  ""I'll treat you how you treat me"" generations. Not realizing it really is a ""you treat others how you want to be treated"" in real life. The 1st way has unrealistic and unreasonable expectations. No one knows how you feel. So, how are they supposed to treat you without knowing how you feel, or they may have made you feel? It's just an excuse for not having real discussions with one another. Even hard ones that make you feel awkward, uncomfortable, embarrassed, ashamed, etc. 

I think for this reason people in general avoid anything intimate. People seem like they also avoid anything in person. Actually, getting close to someone might result in feelings they can't handle. 

The younger generations seem to lack critical thinking and common sense and definitely can't ""read the room or figurative room."" In this instance; if this very thing happens to them? They can't understand why it hurts someone else's feelings. No one is the 1st to say. That really made me feel sad and lonely. I'm going to make sure none of my friends ever feel like this. Meaning they lack empathy and compassion as well. GenX up? I think it's anhedonia and apathy. Especially GenX being stuck between Boomers who made them Latch Key kids? And the other generations who behave in a similar fashion. Sandwich generation now. 

I deal with this very situation as well. Birthdays, and every holiday is literally spent alone. Even my milestone birthdays. I turned 50 2 years ago, and I spent that alone too. Even though I made sure my friends didn't spend their 50th alone. Even the hibernaters. I put a card in their mailbox if they didn't answer the door. Then, mailed cards to the ones who lived elsewhere. Texted happy birthday and put it on their social media, too. Whatever I can so they don't feel like I felt. I'm one of the older ones of my class, so in all fairness? There's that. My family doesn't care either. I don't even get an F U. My family used me until I had nothing left, then basically had no more use for me. I'm also LGBT and in a very red state with a very Roman Catholic family. The area I live in? Mostly Roman Catholic. Then Baptist and Lutheran pretty much. There's others of course but only a few churches. It's funny how I'm the exact same person. They turned nasty, hateful, bitter, angry, and rejected me. 

People are people at the end of the day. Everyone needs  to feel love and acceptance. Being rejected? It doesn't matter what the reason is? It still hurts. It still leaves invisible scars and trauma. In the US there's 340 million approximately. None of those people deserve to feel or be treated like they are invisible. 

In my humble opinion? If you invited 30 people? Some of them know each other. They easily could have huddled and made sure someone came to your party. One person always comes with at least one other person. You definitely should have had at the very least two people who showed up. No one coming? It a giant crock of 💩.

Now that I'm older? I spend birthdays and holidays alone mostly because I choose to. Having expectations? Then being disappointed, rejected, and really hurt? I just emotionally couldn't handle it anymore. It was making me feel like OP. I actually tried quite a few times. 

You are right though. Their choices are just that..Their's. It doesn't reflect who you are in your heart. You just have to make sure that you make the choice not to be like them... selfish. Instead be selfless. Give your heart to those who need it. You may not get anything material in return. But if you give your heart to the right people? It will be fulfilling. Be the person you need. Maybe in the process you have thing you need to work on? Everyone usually does. Fix whatever is driving people away from you. Because maybe it's you subconsciously doing it so you don't get hurt?

I feel like I always take extra effort to make sure people feel celebrated, but my birthday was pretty quiet.

24839,m7q5cpk,comment,,"First of all, happy birthday! 

Second, you really shouldn’t weigh the value of your life by what you add to others. It’s not an awful metric per se, but it’s not the only thing you can focus on. It can be increasingly hard to make connections with people, especially these days. 

For me personally, I find it hard to maintain contact/connections with people who are far away or that I don’t interact with regularly. I’m not saying that’s what’s happening with your friends and family, but it’s certainly a possibility. Please don’t let this affect how you see yourself or how you gauge your importance to someone else. 

My recommendation if you’re looking to meet people and connect with others is to find a hobby that you enjoy. It doesn’t have to be expensive or fancy or whatever, but just something that you enjoy that puts you in situations where you have to interact with others. That can be anything from online gaming, to hiking, to doing pottery. 

You can’t really control what your coworkers like or if you mesh well with them, but this is something you do have some control over. So go out, try new things, meet new people and try to make the most out of life. 

And remember, what matters is the value you bring to your own life. These can be small things like finally getting around to hanging up those pesky curtains or going for a nice walk in the morning before work. Just set small goals for yourself and try to focus on the positive. The changes will be subtle at first, but you’ll get there and be all the better for it when you do. 

Life is a journey and sometimes all you can do is put one foot in front of the other and keep looking forward."," First of all, happy birthday!

I will actively ask when I think of it and then put it in my calendar so then when it comes I can at least give them a happy birthday right away to show that I thought of them enough to take the time to say it etc.

You are still young enough to make radical changes if you don't like where you are now. And if you need a friend or an ear please DM me any time. I'd be happy to be your friend!",1,,2025-01-18 00:52:41,t3_1i3oqiz,,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1i3oqiz/todays_my_28_birthday_and_i_am_going_to_end_it/m7q6mqh/,Neutral

Early last year I was in a program because I came so close to ending things and I thought there was no way out of what I was feeling. I thought it was forever. It took a while, but I've finally stabilized to the point where I've started to rebuild my life from where it was. I have faith in you. I believe in you. I believe that you are a good person and I want you to be here."," Happy birthday OP! I am here if you need to talk.

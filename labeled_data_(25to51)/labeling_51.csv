,,,I touched multiple girls inappropriately when I was in middle school and early high school.,"For quick context, I(now 32M) had pretty difficult childhood. Large family, untreated Adhd, bullied and targeted by my own siblings my whole childhood, emotionally neglected, and ostracized. Knowing what I know now, I was clearly in severe need of mental health care and therapy as I clearly had reactive attachment disorder on top of the untreated adhd. My siblings locked me in the snow for hours, would attack me and harass me and then I would deal with the same things at an extremely small school (300 students Pre K - 12th). Even knowing what I know now I still lay in bed some nights so angry and ashamed of myself. When I was 15, I had no control of my anger or emotions and so people avoided me. Then, a group of guys started talking to me one day. They pointed out a girl in our class who was known for dating around. I don't know how they convinced me, but they convinced me to walk over and grab her butt. One of them did it first to ""show me it was okay""... so I did. She laughed it off and told me not to do it again... but the guys laughed and told me she ""was just saying that"".. so I did it again later, I don't know if I was looking for their attention or I was just so over sexualized and lonely, but it went on for so long, it happened so many times and she so clearly wasnt okay with it.. then one day in weight class the girl I had a crush on let one of the guys touch her breast for God knows what reason.. so impulsively I reached up and did the same.. but worst of all there was a group of siblings my parent babysat... one of them was not much younger than me, but in teen years even a year is considered a long time.. one day we were swimming and i was tossing them around the pool and wrestling and I realized I was getting ""excited""... I took advantage of the ""wrestling"". It was never under clothes, and it never went past touching... but to me that doesn't make it any less awful that I would do that. I just lay here some nights and these intrusive thoughts pop up like ""remember that time you just did these things to these girls?"" and I get so angry. I pray that she never realized I did that and that I didn't scar her because I was such an awful person.. but even still... anytime I feel like I'm doing good, and I've overcome my past... these memories haunt me and tear me back down...

Edit for clarifications sake and accountability: So for starters. I think the main feedback I am seeing are the comments about my adhd, other disorders, and the story of the guys. My intent was not to try and use those as ""fluff"" or a crutch.. I over communicate and have had posts on other subreddits taken down for being too long. So I didn't want that to happen and I obviously didn't explain my own perceptions to things properly. My mental health issues are not my fault but they are my responsibility. The choices I made to assault these girls was still a choice I made to chase my own lustful desires and satisfaction with no consideration of them. The ""other guys"" encouraged me the 1st time it happened and with one girl. they did not play any part in it from then on except as witnesses and played no part in the other two girls I victimized... I think my state of mind was looking to it as a road map. Two things can be true at once, first that my life was difficult and thus there were many of Maslows hierarchy of needs that I did not recieve. Second that it does not excuse my behavior or justify it in anyway. But in my studies of psychology I've come across a common thread of seeking the ""purpose behind the behavior"". So I guess my quick typing without context came off as justifying, but that was not my intent nor my feelings on the matter.

2nd. I want to apologize for not having the foresight to place a trigger warning for anyone else who has been victimized in the past or effected by actions such as this. It DOES NOT bring me any comfort to see other posts about how common this is. My hope for this post was not to hear other horror stories about this being a normal male behavior. I have been in therapy a few different times, however the times I have gone into therapy has felt directionless. Even still, therapist are trained to be unjudgmental, to remain impartial and unmoved. I posted this to get real, true responses. So thank you.

To those who have offered words of support and understanding. Thank you for showing me that there are people out there who will understand that I strive everyday to get as far away from the person I was as I can. That I am not that person anymore and never will be again. This was what I needed, to know that others could see past who I was and understand that I despise who I was. That I could still be seen as a person by real people and not just a therapist in a chair being paid to convince me i am a person...

To those who were critical and correcting. Thank you. I learned a while back the value of criticism. Having real people provide insight into these things helps to identify blind spots and mistakes.

To those who were raw. I appreciate your feedback. I understand there's nothing I can ever do to make it right. I can't take away the things that I did regardless of age or circumstances. I am not seeking any forgiveness or get out of jail free card. I am not try to manipulate people to coddle me or tell me what I did ""wasn't a big deal"" or ""normal"". I recognized my failures, my desire to be a better person is not dependent on anyone's forgiveness of ANY mistakes I've made past present or future. I want to be better because I recognized how horrible and disgusting the things I did was and how much hurt and trauma I could have (and as others pointed out) likely did cause. If someone is truly remorseful, they will change with or without forgiveness or acceptance, because it whats right. I can promise you that I will never be that person again, and I will continue doing everything I can to advocate against these behaviors.","For quick context, I(now 32M) had pretty difficult childhood.

,FitPollution254,,,"its not always that easy, look most of us (people like me) have mental illnesses that challenge our mental state which causes impulses and it forcefully makes us do something or it drives us insane the ENTIRE day. people that aren’t mentally challenged don’t understand what i’m trying to say, but simply judge us for being extremely bad people. i understand where everyone is coming from because the things we and i did in the past was wrong, but need to understand the inside and the deeper meaning of the incident. for example, people with bipolar disorder, one of their symptoms is high libido/sexual drive, they can’t control their impulses and thoughts telling them to do so, same as schizophrenics they have almost sound-physical voices in their head telling them to do something, and if they don’t it drives them crazy almost like the voice is REAL. i have schizoaffective disorder which is a mixture of bipolar & schizophrenia. all my life my single mother could never afford medications, and had a bad drug history making it hard for her to get accepted into a medical program for free medications. so in that time of me being 16-19 still living with my mother, i struggled with my own brain telling me to do shit that i have to do or else they will get louder and louder until i do it. now i am 43 years old with 2 past charges, and healthy on medications. i hope you read this insight.",,6,,2023-JAN,,,,1

Speak freely here. Alot of us got fucked by the system and have no jobs or anywhere to live. Have insane amounts of debt due to restitution and still face legal battles. Years or probation. Decades on an unconstitutional registry. We try attacking these systems and we are accused of minimizing or not being sympathetic to any ""victims"" that were a result of what we were charged with. I want this discussion to be different. We are humans too, we just fucked up one time and the world wants to hold it against us. We must come with a solution to break down this barrier once and for all. we as humans first and sex offender second, must have another chance at normal life when we are released or the system doesn't work.

I never see a platform where we can discuss these topics openly without some idiot mod muting/deleting or banning the TRUTH. We must come together and eradicate these false stories and agendas.

,Aromatic_Persimmon29,,There is hope after incarceration.,"I just want to give hope to those that think their life is over because of their accusations/ offense. I was deemed high risk upon release, but probation and my therapist saw through the bs and cut through alot of red tape upon my release. Of a person is not allowed to change than there is no point for therapy as that is the basis. It wasn't easy but I got work in the trades and am working with some of the smartest people in the industry now, completely on my way back up. Im in contact with my children again and they are my biggest advocates. My son is in law school and wants to start challenging our biggest issues one case at a time if he has to. I have been fortunate to save enough to buy a house with my girlfriend and we cant wait to start a family next. I will have normal again and so can you. A couple more years and I should be off the registry as my term will be complete in the eyes of my state law. While I take responsibility for my actions in the past, I never let the systems black or white thinking errors hold me back. If you want it bad enough...",,,7,,,,,1
,,,,"My boyfriend never was incarcerated. But he has been on probation for a long time. This year will be seven years. And he still hasn’t completed his treatment. He’s only been in group counseling for three years. His PO officer said that he could challenge the courts and get off probation sooner, but it would be better if he completed his therapy first. But the problem with my boyfriend is he is indifferent about his offense. He feels that it wasn’t entirely his fault that he was putting in this position. I know the other Reddit you can’t blame the victim, but he does in a way. Because she bathed him by bringing him cookies and sweets, and coming to his work every single day and talking with him and flirting with him, making him feel like she was older than what she was. He never forced himself on her. Regardless of what his offense says. She was actively in a participant. And she even stood up in court and said I don’t want him prosecuted. This is not his fault. But the state prosecuted him anyways.",,3,,,,,,1
,,,,"I’m just hoping he can get off probation in the next three years. But he hast to come to terms with what the therapist wants him to believe. And if he doesn’t, it will be drawn out for a while.

,Aromatic_Persimmon29,,,"I feel for this story as it's scary similar to my own. His po is right in that he can early terminate and yes it looks much better if he ateast completes therapy. I had to convince mine there are two sides of each story and then prove it with my case file and court transcripts. They took a step back after I pointed to the facts that in group they teach us thinking errors and what they are. Black and white thinking is one of the main ones they use to accept resposibilty. How can a victimizer be a victim in the same paragraph? Well, each case and the facts surrounding it are very unique. Each person got to that point in their own way Even if the end outcome was the same. I explained all this with my therapist and like I said made head way. They re-wrote the homework assignment for me where I acknowledged my acts and crimes and accepted responsibility but also allowed me to paint a picture on the bases that i would not have committed mine had I not been influenced when I was at a young age being victimized in the first place.",,,,,,,,1
,Remote-Technology375,,,"I understand not all cases are black and white but when state law states age of consent is this no matter what, one must be coherent how old the person is. If not, it can be a shit storm afterwards. Granted, not all these cases get prosecuted because the minor or anyone else that knew about it ever comes forward about the case, but the fact is, it's based on the age of consent and the consent.  Yes, some people look older than they are, but it is up to us adults to be adult and make sure they are of age and willing before making the move for the action.",,,,,,,,1
,UserError424,,,"I fully agree, but how many teenagers are responsible enough to follow through with that?

It happens every single day across the world. I by no means have the answer or solution but this must be taken into account.

,Remote-Technology375,,,"Truly so. Hell, there are states in the USA that have the Romeo and Juliet law which institutes minors and people older than them must be within 4 years age difference. You are also correct where there is many states where once they hit 16 or 17, without being married it is legal, but there is also one clause with that. That is no pornography, meaning it is still considered child porn if the one under 18 has had any nudes taken of them and sent to the receiver. So, less being said, dating one under 18 is definitely risky business even if it's legal in the state!",,,,,,,,1
,Aeonzeta,Moderation,,"Hi, I just came across this and some other fringe support groups for PFRs and their loved ones, and was wondering a few things about your community's moderation policies.

(1. talking to trolls: Often when people are being assholes, I tend to mistake them for being genuinely confused, or just ignorant and irritated about that ignorance. This leads me to actually attempt conversing with them, and I tend to tolerate far more repetitive and heated conversations than the moderators of most subreddits. Is this allowed to any extent here or do I have to put up a link where they can continue their conversation away from this subreddit?

(2. Pictures of children: obviously pictures that are safe for work, and actually on topic, not just random kid pics(that would be weird, and totally NOT kosher). I posted a link to an article about juvenile offenders and it had a picture of several kids in jumpsuits(probably stolen from popular media, but I can't blame them). Is this allowed or do I have to leave it (and things like that)out of this subreddit entirely?

(3. NSFW affiliate links: I'm an A.I. rookie hobbyist. After creating a chat-bot based off of a PFR that became a lawyer,(A.I. can sort through information much faster than us, and I wanted a resource to share with the community.) I shared it with the main sub and was summarily banned for a second (or third) time, because there are several other NSFW bots that I can routinely block from my feed only because I have an account over two weeks old on that site. Is that sort of thing allowed here or do I leave that out of this community?

(4. Conspiracy theories: Obviously I don't walk around with a tinfoil hat, but I've been batting around a few theories about the origins and true purpose of the registry and suck at researching it. When I asked for help with this personal project from the main subreddit, I was banned for the 3rd(or second) time. Is stuff like that allowed here or do I leave it out of this subreddit?

(5. Frequent activity in NSFW subreddits: My latest ban from the main subreddit seems to be because of responses to advertisements in one of my local Meetup subreddits. (The advertising post was NSFW, but my response aimed to make clear that I wouldn't be having anything explicit over a public forum or explicit IMG files over private messages.) I deleted the response because that's what the moderator told me might get me reinstated, and promised the eternal bachelorhood of my Reddit account(My promise has held, but no dice on the other end.) I understand that this can attract less savory redditors to this subreddit. Unfortunately, they're gonna find us no matter what we do. Wouldn't it be easier to prepare responses that make them feel stupid enough to leave us alone rather than trying to block them whenever we happen to find them, thus encouraging them to find another way in? That sorta ties in to my first concern, but I really just want to know if you're gonna block me based on what I do in other subreddits.

Edit: I'm gonna be adding links to similar support subreddits here as I come across them. If the moderators do not want me to do this, please let me know, and I will delete this segment. https://www.reddit.com/r/PERSECUTEDINAMERICA/s/uL9wl8u4HB is potentially intolerant of the christian faith and the discussion (academic or likely otherwise)thereof.

https://www.reddit.com/r/loveonesofoncefallen/s/3ALYsn4feI is dead as a door nail, but otherwise fine.

https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderHelp/s/NEm8vi43wK (I'm blocked from that one, and they won't let me even see the content, or respond to any of my inquiries, so they might be a fake sub.)

https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffendersMale/s/O3pFJMVh7o (I'm hesitant to add this one because I'm wary of their stated purpose to keep everyone ""honest"". The registry already compels us to speak up about our past, or be utterly annihilated in the court of public opinion. What further incentive do we require to subject ourselves to public scrutiny? And if we do require further incentive, who has the moral, ethical, and legal right to provide it?)

Sincerely, Randall Boggs.",,,,,,,,1
,UserError424,,,"Honestly what you do on your own time is your business. I could care less what you do on other subreddits. My ONLY caveat on this sub is something we need to be mindful of that I only recently came to understand myself. This sub and any of the others are subject to be visited by RSO's (obviously) but some may still be on parole or under heavy supervision that requires phone/computer/internet monitoring software. This software gets triggered by, among other things images and keywords that pop up on the screen. This data is recorded and could be used to determine if such individual knowingly clicked on or saw something he/she shouldn't have per their conditions of parole etc... therfore please use your best judgment when posting as if valuableinformationcan be gained here i wouldnt want them to be afraid either. Then again if I was on parole or under such conditions still I wouldn't be on reddit period... 🤔🤷‍♂️ Ultimately mods have the final say if something looks red flag or inappropriate for this sub, but otherwise have fun.",,,,,,,,1
,Aeonzeta,,,"For folks that are on parole, could we have a flair or tag system designed to warn them if the post contains sensitive material?

I got away with a lot of crap on probation, but only because I was on the kiddy version. I've been off for a while, but I remember that without my Juvenile Corrections Agent to get advice from, and actually talk to, I would have been sunk. I know lots of folks can't even afford their own phone and are using their mom(or other close person)'s computer to get on Reddit, leaving swift, direct communication with their parole officer virtually impossible, which exacerbates this issue.",,,,,,,,1

So wondering if I just lived there, not on the lease, and kept a low profile, if that would be okay? Of course I'd register the address to SO officer I report too. But wondering if other ppl have done this as well and it's all good. Or did this and ended badly? If anyone knows another route, I'd gladly listen. But BFs lease is up end of this month so kindve in a crunch for time. We both have bad credit, and neither has anything saved up. I've tried to look for a 2bedroom home to rent from a private owner, but that's hard to locate. And FB Is full of scammers. Oh and we are in the DFW area if that helps. Any advice or help is much appreciated.",,,,,,,,1

I'm not familiar with Texas restrictions, but in Florida we have to be at least 1000 ft from any designated place where children congregate(2500 in my county), and have to register every 30 days if we don't own or rent the property we're living on(transitory registration).

If you have a license and a vehicle, you could probably park somewhere that complies with your restrictions, and has 24/7 parking. VanLife is sort of frugal, but you'd be saving a ****ton of money if you do the proper research first.

Planet fitness has free showers for $20 a month, and usually 24/7 parking which would make it a great place. If it complies with your distance restrictions DON'T immediately pick it. Shop around, look at every option near you.

Once you have all your options gathered from least desirable to most,(or vice versa) pick the least desirable (so long as it's available) and build a professional relationship with whoever owns the most desirable option. Once you have that relationship established (3 months minimum), broach the subject of parking on that spot and registering that with the sheriff.",,,,,,,,1
,Bubbly_Excitement674,,,"Thanks for this. In texas if you're homeless, then yes every 30 days have to register. And it's 1000 ft in most counties here. Your advice is good advice. I'm just looking more for answers to living in an apartment but not on lease.

Thanks",,,,,,,,1
,Aeonzeta,,,"Should be fine. The owner would obviously have to be aware, and consent to have his/her property registered as your address, and you might have some vehicle registration issues if Texas legislation is as weirdly worded as Florida. Write down every question you have with an explanation of why you're asking. (For your eyes only) After pumping the sheriff for information on these questions, look up the local PFRs and repeat the process to cross reference. Some will consider it a non issue, some will be extremely paranoid, but once you find the most common thread, that's what you compare against the sheriff's statements.",,,,,,,,1

,UserError424,,New flairs being added.,"I'm adding new flairs to help create a system where one can know ahead of time if the post contains sensitive material or may have material that could set off red flags with monitoring software. This is a quick fix that I hope will help, I'm one person rn. I'm working with friends still on the inside and ones out to get our voices heard, free of censorship or fear propaganda with open discussion allowed for all. I've never seen something like this before so here it is. I'm still learning how to run a sub, so rules and so forth are obviously going to change or be added over time. That being said freedom of speech: yes. Hate speech or any type of bullying etc, will not be tolerated. Anything illegal will not be tolerated. Anything that violates reddit rules or T.O.S. will not be tolerated.",,,,,,,,1
,Aeonzeta,,"Please read the whole thing a few times before responding. It's a delicate topic, and I tend to ramble. Basically, I'm asking you to further clarify for the really stupid folks like me. 🤤

Admitting to one's intent to commit a crime is obviously frowned upon, but so far as I know, it's not illegal unless it goes unreported. Likewise, I can't imagine anything said on Reddit that could be a crime, except sharing legally private information. Pictures can be illegal, but only if they contain child pron, or private information. Likewise, it's been a while since I read Reddit ToS, so I'm sure other folks wouldn't mind a link edited into your post for clarification.",,,,,,,,,1
,UserError424,,"If your going to make me do it... basically I'm covering the subs and my own tail here. It's directed towards any bad seed that may wish to make us look bad or try starting discussions out of poor taste.

,Aeonzeta,,"I can't ""make"" you do anything. You're the head Honcho. Like the Guy Who Talks to Fish, I'm just a total stranger, with some weird ideas. If those ideas clash with yours, fine. I'm mature enough to agree to disagree, and anybody else that's subscribed should be just as capable. If, on the other hand, my ideas can nurture your mind, and grow this sub, please take as much as you like.

That ""covering the subs and my own tail"" bit sounds very political and complicated to me, and probably to several other individuals that might come across this. If I might make a suggestion? Make a separate post, specifically to educate the masses on this process. Why this policy exists, who's back you have to scratch(and why), what's the meaning of that piece of legalese in the ToS, etc. Just be as transparent as possible. To be honest, I wish every subreddit did this specifically so that there is no ambiguity.",,,,,,,,,1
,UserError424,,Suggestion noted but I'm not going through all that. I'll just put this as a community highlight and it should stay at the top of the sub for anyone interested.,,,,,,,,,1
,Aeonzeta,,Yessir! 🫡,,,,,,,,,1
,Aeonzeta,,"Thank you, but I honestly could have looked that up on my own. 😅 I suggested editing it into your post because only weird folks like me read Reddit threads unless they're actually talking to at least one of the folks in that thread.",,,,,,,,,1

Just skim the article and look at the pictures to get the idea of what a piezo nerve is.

Mechanical pressure on the piezo nerves creates a reaction in the nervous system that happens without you. And by you, I mean your brain. 

Think of your vagina as a person writing you a letter, and your nerves are the mailman, and your brain is you. They work together and they are connected, but your cortex, your personality (there IS a special place in the brain just for that), is sepreate in the sense that your sensory intake is not who YOU are.

You are not the mailman or your vagina, and you can reject what you learn from the letter from your friend, because your brain is only hearing and retaining what is happeneing. That has nothing to do with your personality.

You chose what yoy wanted, and you probably cried and got very upset he wasn't your boyfriend. Thats what you wanted. I promise :) not that creep. That's who you are. That's your true consent. I'm sure you love him.

Download Spotify and look up the body keeps the score under search and look for an audio book by bessel van der kulk. It will explain away all of your grief with science. This man is so compassionate and loving and down to earth and he wrote it to help people like us to understand rape logically so we can grieve, and process and move on... he makes sense of all of it for us. It's really enjoyable to read and follow. He uses story telling to keep you hooked.

Your amygdala could be in intense distress, raw, angry, fearful... your hippocampus is pumping so much cortisol that you can't remember what's happening in the moment... your muscles could be so tense and tight and uncomfortable, you could be sobbing but numb (that's what I have- I hard sob when I get raped and it only shows in my throat and muscles now because it's happened too much- I even look fine and might be smiling or laughing), and the piezos will still do this... theyll still climax, still secrete vaginal fluids...

There are only three types of nerves in the body:

Hot sensing- chemical reaction
(Protien endings on the atomic structure of these nerves bond with amino acids in other atomic structures- like your rapists skin or pepper spray)

Cold sensing- chemical reaction
(Think mint or the cold bedsheets. Same concept with amino acids for different compounds)

Piezos - the only nerve type that's mechanically activated 
(mechanical- think back to high school science so like crushing salt to turn it into powder)

Piezo on the clitoris have the same makeup and function as the piezos on the arm- like Katie Morton's tickle example.

So in laments terms, if your friend rubs a piece of cake down your tongue and shoves it in your mouth when you are crying, sad, too angry, have no appetite, want something healthy, or are full, or even nautious... 

You have no control over your taste buds reacting to the sugar breaking down. 

You love your boyfriend. It's okay :)) you didn't do anything wrong."," That's not consent.

15433,1hv50wg,post,i think i was sa'd by my brother and i don't know what to do ,"i (20F) recently had a memory about my older brother and i really don't know where to go from here and what to make of it.

i don't even remember exactly when it was. my brother is 2 years older than me and we've always been close. when i was around 13 i think, i used to come into his room at night when i was bored and couldn't sleep just to hang out. we'd just sit up chatting and sometimes he would trace lines on my back to help me relax and go to sleep. he always did it under my shirt on my skin, which i never felt uncomfortable with. but one time when he was doing this, i remember feeling his hand get close to my boob a few times and feeling a little uncomfortable but i just assumed it was an accident or something. but it carried on, and at one point i swear i remember his hand grazing my chest and then quickly grabbing my boob. i remember feeling uncomfortable but i couldn't really put into words why i felt so weird, i just knew i didn't like it. but i just shook it off and again, assumed it was an accident or something.

 I kind of buried the memory for a few years until it's come up again recently. now that I've thought about it, I've had to confront the idea that my brother may have sexually assaulted me. the fact that i don't even remember when it was makes me doubt myself and feel like i might've just misinterpreted or misremembered it, maybe it really was an accident or something, but the more i think about it the harder im finding it to use those excuses. i don't want to have to live with and deal with this, i don't know what that would look like. i want to just ignore it and pretend it never happened and forget about it.

 my brother and i are still really close and i love him. i don't want to have to change that because of this, but i don't want to be doing myself a disservice by sweeping it under the rug. i don't want to confront him about it, or tell my parents or anything - there's not much i can do or want to do in terms of reporting or seeing him punished or anything like that - so it just feels like this big weight that'll just sit on me forever that i can't really do anything with.","i think i was sa'd by my brother and i don't know what to do  i (20F) recently had a memory about my older brother and i really don't know where to go from here and what to make of it.

15438,1hv5lsc,post,sexual experience that left me feeling used,"tw: >!I’m not sure… I know this isn’t SA, but I feel like my boundaries were violated in the first part. !<

Going to delete this soon and I want to just get this out...

(f24) I was going on my first-ever date with a guy (m35) I met on a dating app, never dated before. Before we met, we FaceTimed. We were just talking, and at some point, I mentioned that I had never dated and was still a virgin. He asked me if I wanted to ""practice."" I didn’t agree with him, but he responded by saying, ""Okay, let’s hang out tomorrow."" He mentioned he was going to the mall to pick up something from a clothing department.

I thought we were going to walk around the mall together, just talking and getting to know each other. Later that night, he texted me about my ""head game."" I told him I couldn’t really imagine doing that, and we hung up since it was getting late. He kept texting and asking about doing BJs, saying I’d ""fall in love"" if I tried it. I told him to slow down and suggested we could just kiss instead. He called me ""Mother Teresa,"" which I laughed off.

The next day, I got casually dressed, put on some perfume, and headed out, excited for what I thought would be a normal date. In all seriousness, I thought he was joking about the whole ""BJ practice"" thing. I didn’t realize he was completely serious.

Instead of going into the mall, he parked in an empty lot near the area. While there were many cars in one section, he chose a super secluded spot. I was only willing to kiss him—that was all I wanted. I just wanted to make out. I’m not entirely innocent in this either, and I recognize that.

He asked if I had ever done a BJ before. I told him no and said I didn’t like the idea of it. Then he suggested we go to the back seat. I agreed, still only wanting to kiss. Before we made out, I asked if he had any cold sores, herpes, or anything like that, and he said no (and to clarify, I’m safe after this interaction).

We started kissing, and he began sucking my breasts. Then he said, ""Let’s practice. You’re going to practice."" He pulled down his pants super fast and arranged me so I was sitting up straight on the seat. I abided as he placed his penis in my mouth after I opened it, and he started face-fuck*ing me. In my head, I kept thinking, ""What the f*?"" I was blank for a few moments, but I went along with what he wanted. He eventually came.

At a certain point, I wanted him to stop, but I was scared and had too many thoughts running through my head. After he finished, he sat back down. I still wanted to kiss him and brought it up. At some point, I told him he had forced me, and he responded with, ""Nooo... don’t say that,"" in a way that made me laugh.

After that, I moved closer, still wanting to kiss him more, but he didn’t want to kiss me anymore. I wanted to take the situation better in my head, but he said he didn’t want to taste himself.

At this point, I was slightly willing to give him a BJ. I started with a handjob, but he said he would only get aroused with my mouth. I hesitated but ended up trying again. I guess I wasn’t doing it the way he wanted because he started face-f\*\*\*ing me again.

Afterward, he said he had to go to the gym and that he was running late. I asked if we were still going to the mall, and he questioned me, ""You still want to go?"" He seemed annoyed by me later on because I was just kissing him.

He eventually dropped me off where he had picked me up. I cried on my way back home.

There is so much more to this story because I’ve come to realize he is a sexual manipulator. I had a phone call with him, and he admitted that I was being resistant and nagging.

I’ve been going to therapy about this… It’s been eating me up a bit, like my morals and values were thrown out the window. I keep thinking it’s my fault because I could have stopped it at any time. But yeah…

How do I cope with something like this? I keep crying, and my spirit has been so low and down. I can’t even look men in the eyes anymore because I feel like they can see through me, or I imagine they know what I’ve done.

A man approach me in the gym the other day just to help me because I was struggling with a machine. I was super nervous and ignored his gaze and just said thank you. 

It is affecting me a lot.

15443,1hv640p,post,was this SA?,"I experienced something as a teenager that I have never really talked about. However, I think that it is partly responsible for my mental health problems and i am thinking about talking to my therapist about it.

I tried to talk about it twice with my respective partners, but the reactions were so bad for me that I never tried to tell anyone about it again. Maybe it's not that bad and it's more stressful for me than it should be. I don't know.

I got drunk at a party when I was 15. I didn't want to go home afterwards because I was afraid of getting into trouble with my parents. An friend of mine (didn't know him well) then offered me to spend the night at his place. He was in his late 20s at the time and there was never anything sexual between us. 
When I fell asleep at his place, I woke up at night because he had his hand in my pants. He started fingering me. I panicked and didn't know what to do. I was so scared. I was afraid that the situation would escalate if I resisted and said no. And i was afraid because I wouldn't have been able to get home from there alone at night. So i pretended that i was still asleep and turned away, which made him take his hand away at some point. I felt helplessly at the mercy and was very very scared. 

At the next day i pretended i didn't know anything and was happy when he finally drove me home. After that i never talked with him again and avoided the places were he has been.

At that time i had a boyfriend. When I tried to tell him about it, he was angry with me. As if I had cheated on him. And years later, when I tried to tell my new boyfriend about it, he said it wasn't a big deal and that he might have tried to do the same thing.

After that, I never told anyone about it again.

I'm not sure but I think this was a traumatic experience for me. But when I think about the reaction of the two people I tried to tell, I'm not sure if it was sexual assault at all.

15450,m5qt0bk,comment,,"I tried two virtual therapists last year and it did not work at all. I found that a female, in person therapist was best for me. You can also look for someone who specializes in women’s issues, sexual assault, or trauma. 

The worst part about finding a therapist is that not everyone is a fit. Look for traits in a therapist that you feel comfortable with in a friend. Maybe you want a specific gender, maybe you want someone your age (not sure how old you are or if that is feasible), maybe you want someone who is older and has more experience. 

I know it’s a lot of work to find someone. Once you come up with a list, if you are US based, call your insurance company and tell them “I’m looking for a therapist in *city* who specializes in *xyz*, that is in network, and female” or what ever criteria you’d like. They should be able to send you a list of people who are in network. Obviously the more filters you give, the shorter the list will be. You can google their names, read reviews if there are any, see pictures of their faces, ect before you schedule. Good luck!

15457,1hv8913,post,Somethings gotta be wrong with me. Why does this keep happening.,"Sexually traumatized people from any sexuality, race, or gender tend to form groups. People with these traumas tend to form bonds rather quickly. After all, though sexual trauma isn't rare it's often overlooked in conversations because it's a particularly difficult subject. So when they find someone they can not only open up about their experiences with but even relate with they form a bond called a trauma bond. These bonds can be very strong or weak depending on the environment they are made in. For me most of these bonds were formed in high school. I had a childhood that my therapist called ""sad beyond her experience"" She told me that the trauma I had endured was so complex that I didn't even know I was affected by these events almost like a layer of film on a tv that has to be removed to see the movie behind it clearly. Im also high functioning autistic so one of the effects I hadn't noticed, like many other people that were sexually abused was my sexual boundaries were blurred. So in high school when I made a whole friend group of people with these trauma bonds it wasn't unusual for my friend group to grab each other's boobs or butt without asking playfully. These blurred boundaries even led to me allowing myself to be taken advantage of in front of one of my friends without realizing it till years later when the friend said he doesnt want to hang out with me anymore because after he witnessed that happen to me anything our friend group did as a joke just wasnt the same coming from me and made him uncomfortable. Lucky he wasnt and isnt mad at me and has even vouched for me since we stoped speaking when someone asked him about something my cousin said that i will talk about later on in this post. Once I became an adult though I quickly saw how uncomfortable these things made me specifically with one of my younger friends who was a trans man who had similar trauma to me name “ryan” who tended to go too far. My therapist recommended I be open with him to allow things to stop so I could be comfortable around him again. Other people in my friend group cited similar experiences and we all spoke to him. Unfortunately, he deflected and told me that I had groped him multiple times. I was hurt by this and it sent me into a spiral I'm still in to this day. While in this spiral I was able to think of 4 similar incidents that I had experienced since the age of 12. Incident 1 was when I was 12 I went to a facility called a ""youth shelter"" which is where I stayed until I could find a home to foster me. while in the facility a 16-year-old girl asked me out and being a  young female bi sexual I thought it was super cool that a 16-year-old girl would want to date me so I said yes. Later that night I bragged about it to her friends in front of her and I think she panicked because the next morning I was moved out of the facility because she told staff I had ""tried to inappropriately touch her but was unsuccessful"" Of course I cried and promised I hadn't and the staff of course believed me but I couldn't stay. The 2nd incident wasn't confirmed its only a suspicion. I had dated a girl in middle school and the relationship was awkward especially since she had a mind much more innocent than mine. Everything was fine until I was adopted and moved 6 hours away from my ex. then in my last year of middle school at another school she posted on Instagram a photo of me, her and the rest of our old friend group and the caption said that a girl had ""done stuff with a boy she liked and tried to get her to do things she didn't want to do"" I assumed it was about me because she had told me she didn't trust me saying she felt “like i would betray” her one day and when we had dated we did speak about sex. There was also a boy she liked who had tried to sleep with me and I told her which could explain the ""done stuff with a boy she liked"" Luckily for me I was able to say no to the boy and he stopped but he had gone on to SA multiple other girls after said event. When I texted my ex she said that the post wasn't about me but was rather about another girl she met at summer camp and changed her caption to clarify that no one in the picture that was posted was the perpetrator.  I just didn't make since to me though and to this day I'm not convinced it wasn't about me. The 3rd incident was after I was adopted I met a cousin who told people she had a crush on me (which made me uncomfortable but I brushed it off) and was known for lying for attention and would lie about anything from her favorite color to who her birth dad was. I try not to judge her because she has a lot of stuff I'm not fully aware of going on and I sympathize. In my second year of high school, though I went to a dance and she had gone too, her date that night was the younger friend “cody” who witnessed me getting taken advantage of a year after this dance. While at the dance I approached my cousin and danced with her for probably 30 seconds she then ran off and while she was gone I spoke to her date because he was my friend. After a little a random girl told me that someone new to the high school named ""Rayne"" wanted to speak to me so I went to find her. I introduced myself to Rayne and she immediately asked ""Did you grab your cousin's boob because we don't do that around here"" I of course told her I did not and went back to my friend who had confirmed he didn't see anything because he was there watching us the whole time. A week or so later my cousin ran up to me and my friend group in the cafeteria and just screamed that she was sorry and ran off. Now the fourth incident was the trans friend I mentioned near the beginning of this post after Ryan said I had groped him during our friend ship I spiraled because I did grab his chest (which I admitted to everyone and tried to validate ryan for).my old friends cody says sometimes he questions wether or not im a predator for what ryan has said about me even though he doesnt fully believe it and the Rayne girl that my cousin ran to the night of the dance was also informed of this and I can't imagine what she must think of me especially since raynes current boyfriend is my emotionally abusive ex whos have been helping spread these rumors since I've graduated. For the first time I couldn't defend myself Ryan and my ex ( my ex was held back in the second grade so hes still a senior) are both still in highschool and I'm gone. I was convinced ryan was right even going as far as to apologize to my friends, family, and boyfriend. I had even told my boss and co workers who tried to comfort me and validate how i felt. All my loved ones, therapist, and mutual friends of Ryan had to tell me that what I did in the friend group was NOT groping especially since multiple people saw him do it back multiple times (which ryan tried to gaslight me into believing didnt happened when I pointed that out)  and Ryan was only saying that to avoid responsibility for groping ALL of us (according to his standards), guilt tripping me into watching porn with him, and ignoring his cousin and my friend ""jr"" when jr begged him to stop touching him and grabbing his thighs and chest because he was mølested by his ex and didnt handle that kind of touch well. ryan had told jr “oh its fine” and even told his grandma to “fuck off” when his grandma pointed out jr seemed to be very uncomfortable. Now that I know I'm not a criminal and my whole friend group isn't willing to forgive him. only one problem remains ""Why me"" and what would the world think? I always wanted to make music but I feel like I can't because if the world heard my story they would hate me. I often look back on an artist I used to love named Melanie Martinez who I recently stopped listening to due to r@pe allegations. Even though the accuser admitted that's there no proof I still jumped in and believed her and helped destroy Melanie's career. So I can't imagine what the world would do to me even with the evidence I have to back me up. I just don't believe that the world would welcome me because of my story. I think the world would wish me dead which sucks because I've always wanted to be a famous musician ever since I was locked in a house and sexually abused by my stepdad. Sometimes I feel alone even though my therapist assures me this is far from a rare experience. Now that I'm 19 I see canceled celebrities and cry because I know that would be me too.","Somethings gotta be wrong with me. Why does this keep happening.

His parents were downstairs and both he and I have been away from each other for 3 weeks so we were both pretty sexually frustrated. I was fully receptive to his advances but I thought that he felt that sex was off the table due to being at his parent’s place (For the record I would have been fine with it, I just got the vibe that he wasn’t and I’m very shy with sex and initiating). We started kissing and whatnot and agreed to just do stuff with our hands while obviously trying to be very quiet. After a little bit he said “Want to try something?” and I said “sure, what?” hoping he’d explain but he decided to show me. So he got on top of me and pulled my pants down halfway— in my mind I thought it would be easier to just take them off entirely so I did, but he took that as me signaling that I wanted to have intercourse, so he switched plans midway because he thought that was the queue. We started having intercourse and I didn’t ever give him any indication that I didn’t want to or anything— and it’s not that I didn’t want to, I just didn’t expect it right that second if that makes sense? I was caught off guard. Afterward, when he realized I may have felt weird about it he felt awful and said he felt like he took advantage of me and apologized profusely. We talked about consent and I genuinely feel like it was a miscommunication of boundaries and whatnot. He asked what to do in terms of communication and consent in the future and we agreed it needed to be verbal and explicit. I know that if I would have shown any discomfort or told him no in ANY way, he would have immediately stopped, I was just surprised and kind of froze up. He has always respected my physical boundaries. Is this something I can move past and how? I feel like it’s a very specific and weird experience and I feel alone. ","Help determining what this was?

We allow it because we feel we have no choice. We get scared or we feel that even if we try something, it will come back worse.

I remember with my babysitters brother, when I told the sister what he was doing and she didn't beleive me and then he made it worse. 

That fear is real and we should not blame ourselves because were can't fight back. It is so easy to look back years later now that we know more, are stronger and try to replay the scenario again and feel we failed because we see new options now. But we aren't back then as we are now, we were who we were back then less sure what to do.

So when we feel defeated we allow it to continue because we don't see a way to stop it. Many survivors often say that when it becomes a pattern they sometimes just comply just to get it over with faster because they see no way out.

This doesn't make them bad or sick or gross. They are just tyring to survive.

Don't blame yourself about not staying away, you felt weird but you didn't know what he would do.

I also know about your mother and I understand why you didn't tell her. It is hard when family looses our trust. This I am sure if why you didn't do anything because if you can't trust her, who can you trust that would have been able to handle it.

I don't beleive you are a pervert for one second nor that you wanted this, He was the one, he was the pervert and he was the one who wanted to do it,

I try something more simplistic. I say imagin a door open in your house. When the door closes, consider that like an orgasm. When you are with someone and you are excited and having a sexual experience, your mind goes and closes that door.

Imagine now that the assaulter is attacking the house and breaks open a window and the wind comes in and shuts the door.

about two to three weeks ago i went on a second-ish date with a man & obviously we ended up having sex. we didn’t have any condoms and he teased multiple times into doing it raw which i obviously said no to because i barely knew him & i was ovulating, so i didn’t wanna risk it. he kept saying that ‘precum isn’t real’ and that ‘i wasn’t gonna get pregnant just with a few strokes’. obviously i don’t buy that shit and i didn’t give a fuck about whatever he was saying, i kept saying no and even moved his dick away from my vagina a few times cause i guess he liked the tease. after a few minutes, i was upside down and i literally felt it inside me, which at the moment made me react like, fine, whatever, i’ll take the morning after pill i guess. he was just a few minutes inside of me & i never felt violated or assaulted or remotely harmed by the action while it was happening. i was a little uncomfortable, i wasn’t really enjoying it cause i was thinking about the amount of shit i had to take care of just cause a random man decided to fuck me raw when i explicitly said no to it.
and now, a few weeks later, i am feeling a bit queasy about it. cause why the hell did he do something i said i didn’t want to do. i haven’t talked to him in a few days and honestly i don’t really wanna see him again, but i don’t know if this is something i should converse with him or just let it slide, which i don’t think i will. but my question, or doubt here is, is this valid as sexual assault? i know that it is by textbook definition, but i truly don’t know if i’m shaken by it or harmed in any way. i think i just don’t want to see this specific guy again but, i don’t feel wildly affected by it","help me understand this specific situation  hello everyone. i’m just going to cut to the chase since i believe this blog is always flooded with posts;

It’s dark… really dark. Your weight presses me into the mattress. You tell me that everything is fine. You say I need to calm down. I keep telling you no, over and over again. I don’t remember when you took off my underwear. I just remember you being big and heavy. I remember saying your name over and over again, begging you to stop. I remember trying to push you away. I don’t know what you were thinking. I wish I knew… I wish I could have heard your thoughts. I wish I knew why you didn’t listen to me. You put it in and it hurt. It hurt deep down inside my gut. I told you that you were hurting me. I started scratching at you in the dark, and you pushed my arm down into the mattress. I started to whimper, and you covered my mouth with your hand. I couldn’t believe you did that. You couldn’t deal with having to listen to what you were doing. I remember everything in fast-forward. I can’t keep track of time in the memories.

15503,1hvcj23,post,I feel disgusted that I stayed with him ,"Today has been a pretty shitty day for me. I’ve been thinking a lot about my SA today as my designated case officer sent me a non-update on the case, which has just made so many thoughts and feelings come up.

It’s 11pm and I’m laying in bed, all of a sudden feeling so disgusted in myself for having stayed with my ex. He recorded himself sexually assaulting me and I was fully aware of what he had done, and yet I decided it would be a worse pain to be without him. I decided it was a better option to live with him knowing what he was doing than to be without him. I largely attest this to my BPD, as my abandonment issues are so strong.

Hell, he broke up with ME. If he hadn’t, I’m sure I’d still be with him right now, because I couldn’t bring myself to leave him. In fact, when he broke up with me I begged, like physically on my knees sobbing and pleading BEGGED him to stay with me.

15519,1hvdku9,post,I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to heal from my assault ,"Hi everyone, this is my first time posting here but I feel like I need advice or comments or anything really from people who have been living with this for longer than I have. I am 20 now, but 2 1/2 years ago when I was 17 I was sexually assaulted at knife point and then attacked with said knife by my then boyfriend who was also 17. We had been friends for a long time and dating for almost a year at that point, and for the longest time I completely blocked it out. I didn’t tell a single soul, not my friends, not my family, I didn’t even really let myself think about it. We continued to date for another 6 months after the assault because, to be honest, I was terrified of him now. We had sex 2 more times after that, he didn’t ask for permission either time, and I didn’t say no out of fear, so idk if either of those count as assault. In the months leading up to our breakup, (which had nothing to do with the assault because I was still in denial) I began to experience fainting spells and convulsions that were later diagnosed as a condition known as PNES (psychogenic non-epileptic seizures). I visited countless specialists, neurologists, and cardiologists before we received this diagnosis after a very long hospital stay for an EEG. We didn’t know why I developed this condition, until my now boyfriend and I were talking about my ex boyfriend on the phone one night and I was telling him about a few things that concerned him. One thing led to another and after several hours on the phone it all came out.  I was absolutely devastated, as this is the first time I was able to see things for what they were, and in November of 2023 I began to see a therapist and psychiatrist after telling my parents so that I could process things in a healthy way. I’ve been to the ER too many times to count due to my episodes, which leave me unconscious for anywhere from 2-20 minutes, and sometimes involve seizing, screaming, or attacking myself or others around me, and I have had 4 concussions since August. I feel completely crazy and even though I haven’t spoken to my ex boyfriend since the breakup, it’s like I can’t escape him, like he’s still hurting me all the time. My boyfriend now is absolutely amazing, he supports and takes care of me through everything and is trying so hard to help me heal at my own pace, but I would really appreciate some advice from people who truly understand what it’s like. I just want to know if it ever gets better. Thank you so much for reading.

Maybe a little long sorry! 

I have a lot of doubt about what happened mid 2020- covid restrictions hadn't long since been lifted i met this guy outside work, said he worked in a different part of the hospital (saw his ID) and we got to chatting. Now im really bad at saying no to people/boundaries were worse then (hadn't had over a years worth of trauma therapy then either). We exhanged numbers got to going out for a coffee date. 

Now here is where i start being stupid. I offer to drive him back to his flat because it was cold/raining and a number of miles away and im a people pleaser or was then at least. He asks me in for coffee i thought okay. We were chatting for while he started turning the conversation to him wanting sex, i stated that i don't do that on first dates/until i know someone really well etc i already had vagismus so fine intercourse really hard/painful anyway. 

I'm trying to to be too graphic here so i'll spolier tag the worse bit he starts saying its about respecting the person not about sex itself he repeats this multiple times when i say i don't do this. Basically the spolier tag is SA/possible rape 

 >!so he then locks his door with me inside with him, so i feel trapped and he is bigger than me, taller and broader than me. I just go with it because what else can i do, i don't remember all the next details really i know clothes are off he is trying to penetrate and can't get all the way due to above condition which is painful obviously, i just lay there really and not say anything else (which maybe i should have but i probably froze honestly) he gives up at some point and seems angry, i try to explain the condition and he just ignores me and unlocks the door so i go home!< 

I don't tell anyone until about 2 years ago when my PTSD symptoms become more obvious to me and i have to get my mental health team involved etc. Even now i've only told a few friends and my therapist who say this is SA/Rape and i just don't really see it because he didn't get all the way 🤷‍♀️ this why i feel like it wasn't as bad even though i was in pain. 

I have been working on this with my therapist a few months ago and i was doing well but something that happenes at work thats triggered it, i have therapy again this thursday so will be discussing this with her. 

I just feel like i'm stupid, making it up, making it out to be worse, like im lying. 

He's now in a different country so i don't have his info any longer so can't report him to anyone and i feel bad that i should have reported him. Its all just mixed up.

How do i sort through this at least a little before therapy thursday? Thank you! ","Does anyone ever feel like your lying about it because you didn't tell anyone to start with or that your making it out to be worse than it was?  So essentially the title.

15536,1hveo0k,post,I (22F) feel violated after consensual anal with my husband (25M)- why?,"TW: history of SA, kind of explicit sexual language 
 
Throwaway account for obvious reasons. The purpose of this is to vent & receive insight. I’m sorry this is so long— I feel like it’s necessary information but also kind of suck at telling short stories. 

My (22F) husband (25M) and I have had an active and satisfying sex life since getting married in February of 2024. We did wait until marriage, with the exception of occasional oral, though he previously had other partners. I also have a history of SA and a history of a relationship in which I was R’ed multiple times. 

I want to start by saying that he is the most loving & caring man I’ve ever met. Not only are we very much so in love, but he loves me so very well consistently. He knows about my trauma and goes out of his way to make sure I’m okay during sex. 

A few months ago, we decided we wanted to try anal (me receiving, not him).  Both of us wanted to and we talked about it ahead of time (not just in the heat of the moment) and discussed that we’d start with fingers and maybe order a toy or two before moving forward with actual anal sex. Upon our first time trying with just one finger, in the heat of the moment, it felt good & we just went for it & went alll the way. It went well, honestly, and was really clean. He constantly asked me if I was okay and made sure I was having a good time. I cannot stress this enough: he did everything right. However, I felt really yucky afterwards. Something in me felt violated even though I wasn’t. I felt weepy and sad and nauseated. We snuggled and went to bed and the next day I still couldn’t shake it. We talked about it and how I was feeling and decided that we were not going to do anal again. 

Fast forward to today. Last night, my husband was a little tipsy but I didn’t think he was drunk. I was sober. We both wanted to have sex all afternoon so we were excited when we finally got a chance to last night. Only a few seconds into doggy, he stuck his finger in my ass. We haven’t done *anything* related to butt stuff since last time, so it shocked me, but it felt good. He asked “does that feel good?” And I said yeah, so he kept doing it. Then he said “I want to fuck your ass” and I didn’t say anything for a little, but I thought about it and eventually said he could because I liked how the finger felt. He immediately put it in all the way really really fast and it hurt and I told him to please go gentle and he slowed down. A little while later he keeps talking about how he wants to eat my ass. We have never talked about this before so I said no- I didn’t even prep for any butt stuff so I felt like we were pushing it. He asked again like twice and I finally said he could. He did it a few times in between penetration and I didn’t necessarily mind, it felt okay. Then he kept asking me if I wanted to taste myself. That was an emphatic no every time, but he asked it multiple times- sometimes saying “I really want you to taste yourself, it’d be so hot if you’d taste yourself on me”- and the constant push honestly bothered me. (Looking back, I wonder if he was tipsy and kept forgetting that he asked already?) He kept getting close to finishing and then pulling out and going down with his mouth because he “didn’t want it to end”. I eventually was like “I’m almost done with this” and I just wanted him to finish. It felt like it was dragging on. I know I absolutely could’ve stopped it, but I didn’t want to disappoint him. He was really enjoying it. 

He finished and laid down next to me. I got up to go to the bathroom and clean up. I took a quick (5 min max) shower. I texted him and asked for water and a towel before getting in but never heard back. I dry myself off with a hand towel (lol) and walk back to the bedroom to find him passed out. I wake him, and it takes quite a bit of effort, but he gets up really grouchy. He is notoriously kind of mean/combative (verbally) and irritable when he’s only half awake. He’s 
really difficult to wake up. I wake him finally and he was mean as a snake. I don’t have great examples, he was just bitching and telling me I was being annoying and nagging and that I “always do this” (nagging, maybe?) etc.- half-asleep nonsense. Regardless, the pit in my stomach following sex just grew exponentially after this interaction. There was no warmth or love present anymore. He finally gets up to take his contacts out and clean up and stuff and I tell him to sleep on the couch and he agreed without asking questions. I didn’t realize just how drunk he had gotten until this moment. I cried myself to sleep in our bedroom, he went to watch tv on the couch. 

He wakes me around 5am getting into bed and hugs me from behind, he asks “did you have fun last night?” I feel panicked, like I could vomit, and don’t answer. He asks “are you okay?” and (because I’m trying to go back to bed and not have the convo then) I mumble “I’m trying to sleep”. He lets it go. We wake up later this morning and he asks the same question- “did you have fun last night?” And I said “well, kind of” and explained how i was feeling. I explained what happened the same way as i did above and mentioned that i felt the same way that i felt last time we had anal, but a little worse because of how he acted afterwards. I said i felt a little bit used. I mentioned that i thought we agreed not to do it again, and that its not his fault since its up to me to also make sure it didn’t happen again, but that he didn’t ask permission to put anything into my butt before putting his finger in. I mentioned that repeatedly asking for things I said no to also made me uncomfortable. 

Ultimately, I can tell he’s trying not to cry because he doesn’t want to make it about him. He’s profusely apologizing (and yes, he absolutely means it). He says he knows he drank too much. He mentions that he feels as though he R’d me, and I said he didn’t, and that did make him feel better. I know he genuinely feels really bad, so I didn’t want to talk about it anymore because I really don’t want him to feel bad. He mentioned “maybe we can have some gentle sex later so I can make love to you to make it up to you”. The gesture is very sweet, but I truly cannot think about sex right now. When I got to work he also texted me about how sorry he was. He asked “are we okay?” and I replied “yeah we are, I just need to work through these feelings” and he said he understood. I got home from work a few hours ago and it hasn’t come up again. But here I am, sitting across the room from him, and my stomach is in knots. My body still kinda hurts from yesterday. I feel uneasy and yucky, the way I felt last time & the way I felt after my SAs. 

He didn’t SA me… so why do I feel so violated?? 
I’m open to any insight, but please know that he is genuinely one of the best people I’ve ever met. He wouldn’t hurt a fly. He loves me so well and with his whole being. Please judge with this in mind. He’s not secretly some kind of narcissist or anything (trust me, I’d know), so some type of evil intention is not the answer.  

I guess what I’m asking is: can anyone relate? Why may I feel so violated? How do I proceed? ","I (22F) feel violated after consensual anal with my husband (25M)- why? TW: history of SA, kind of explicit sexual language

15561,m5swufd,comment,,"That is SA. Unless you *have told him* in advance that it is OK to interact with you sexually while you sleep (and haven’t since told him not to), it’s SA. I’m not saying you have to report him, that’s too personal of a choice with many consequences associated with either decision. What I am saying though is that he isn’t respecting your boundaries. 

Pressuring you into sex isn’t acceptable either. Again… *boundaries*. 

So, I’m not into withholding sex as punishment, but you have a guy here who doesn’t respect when you say “no”. In this case, I would let him know you don’t intend to sleep over as often if he keeps messing with you in your sleep. You need for him to respect you and if he doesn’t now, there’s a significant chance he never will. Stand your ground, don’t cave in after promises “oh honey, I never realized it bothers you that much, I *promise* I’ll never, never, do it again”… yeah, stuff like that. If you easily give in then he will (at least subconsciously) know how to break your will, how to get his way. 

Brutal honesty? At this phase in your life, he doesn’t sound like the right guy for you. Even if you’re sure “he’s the one”, is *he* ready for that role. Based on how he’s behaving, I’d say “no”.

15571,1hvgxwf,post,Did my mom SA me or was she just being weird ,"I grew up in an extremely abusive household: addict father who had violent tendencies, neglectful mother who let it all happen and egged him on. My relationship with my mother has always been super complicated, I was her protector from my dad’s abuse, but once they divorced she kind of discarded me and we had a really rocky relationship for a few years, majorly due to a psychotic episode I had at 13/14 and her abusive nature. This is when these instances took place. (13-16, i am 18 now.)

My mother is a very immature and jealous woman. She has orthorexia and hates fat people, all her self worth lies in her looks. She was “fat” as a kid (not actually fat, just big by 80s standards) and I was not. I am a very small person, at my heaviest I was 115 and I am currently 105. She also has plastic boobs, I am naturally a D cup. She hates this. As soon as I developed, she made lots of comments to the effect of “I paid $10k for my tits and yours are bigger!” I know weird comments aren’t SA but she refused to stop even after i asked her to, this is just background information i suppose.

The actual instances i’m asking if are SA are as follows: multiple times, we got into arguments while i was about to shower. She would burst into the bathroom and make it a point to yell at me while i was naked to embarrass me. She did this 3 or 4 times over the span of about 3 years. One more isolated incident was when i was 14, i got my hair dyed. We were arguing about it (she didn’t let me get what i wanted) and i said i had rights to my own body, she smacked my ass and said “i’m your mom, i do what i want to your body.” I told her to stop and she did it again.

I don’t know if this is just crossing a boundary or SA, any opinions are appreciated, thank you!",1,3.0,2025-01-07 2:21,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hvgxwf/did_my_mom_sa_me_or_was_she_just_being_weird/,Neutral

15576,1hvhgt9,post,Was This Sexual Assault?,"I am F17 he is M17 we are both in our in my senior year of high school and have been dating for a year, this happened last fall a week or two after home coming. We had driven to our favorite spot to hang out, a hidden spot behind a hill to park down by a river. Around this time my painic attacks had hit an all time spike. (I hyperventilate and go into a state where I can’t speak) He had coached me through many of my worst attacks, and knew how negatively I had been affected by them. In an effort to combat these attacks I would take Benadryl to slow my body down, the only downside to this is that I become extremely groggy and not aware of my surroundings. 

I had an attack while we were getting sexual, which had happen before, and he proposed that we stop being sexual for a while. I took a Benadryl to calm my self down but it was raining and I hate the rain. So he built us a sweet little fort in the back seat of his small 2001 Buick La Sabre. And we put on a movie and feel asleep. I had woken up but chosen to just stay laying there because I was still very groggy. I felt him pull it out of his boxers (he had his boxers on and I was still fully nude) and he noticed I was up and started to kiss me. And I went down and gave him some head. He then flipped me over so he was planked ontop of me and kissing me. As he would move I felt his dick insert slightly into me 3 times. And then he kissed me a bit more and it was over. 

We then got up, and I was so groggy still but I knew something was wrong. He had me take down the fort because I was small enough to get it down without making it all tumble. Then on the car ride home I realized that what was done was rape, I had agreed to not having any more sexual contact. That was something he had proposed, that was his idea and he went back on it. He went back on it knowing how Benadryl affects me.

In the days that followed I had immense emotional distress, but I didn’t cry. I had panic attacks and reoccurring dreams and thoughts of the night. I told a friend who went and told a bunch of people and stopped listening to my story betraying my trust and ultimately losing my friendship. And me and him were rocky, I wanted him but I was scared of him. We went on breaks on and off, broke up at one point, and we’re still together now. But I still have this deep inner fear of him. 

We have spoken about it since, and his reasoning for going back on his word was that he had just woken up and forgotten. And I’ve just had to accept that, because I still love him. 

Last Friday night we were in my bed, I feel asleep and had one of my reoccurring dreams and woke up. And I just couldn’t take his touch and was afraid by it. And he just really wanted to comfort me by holding and touching me, but I was afraid and couldn’t vocalize it.

Can anyone give me advice? ","Was This Sexual Assault?

15581,1hvi5jd,post,Anyone else flip flop between issues with hyper sexuality and asexuality?,"I understand hyper sexuality is normal after trying to internally reason with what happened, but it’s a fairly new thing for me. 

At first I was really struggling with intimacy, even certain words or phrases were very triggering let alone being touched. 

They still are, but out of nowhere (as of the last 6 months) I’ve been very hypersexual, although I don’t really act on it, it comes out in other unhealthy ways. 

Now that it’s been a little while and I’m starting to settle I go between being almost entirely asexual and very hypersexual. 

Can anyone tell me how properly work through this? Or where to find the knowledge to make the hypersexuality go away? I really don’t like it and want to make a serious attempt at working at it.

15588,1hvibwt,post,Is this grooming? ,"Throwaway account and massive text incoming. Me (19M) and my gf (18F) have been dating for 3 years. As of recently she has been becoming a bit more withdrawn and distant from me. In March of last year I felt something was off and went on her Snapchat account and found that she had been talking to a stranger.

Because of Snaps nature a fair few texts weren't saved so I couldn't get a full picture of what occured. However there were probably over 90 explicit photos sent by her to this guy.

Supposedly it started off with them meeting and becoming friends, one of the first photos is when they played a game of truth or dare, she said to him ""your turn O"" whilst smiling then maybe a month down the track he started going a bit darker and asking her to send explicit photos, (fast forward to when I found out and confronted her about it, she said he threatened to hurt himself if he didn't) and surely enough here and there I found photos of him sending knives saying ""don't you just love to cut yourself"" so that checks out.

Anyway in most earlier images such as the aforementioned your turn one (which is my main one of being worried because she was smiling fully, and it seemed free of coercion) she seemed pretty okay, but that was the only one of a suspicious nature. Then as time went on she shad been sending explicit photos and her smile was either non existent or looked forced, she had some pretty scared looking faces in some of them so it's really hard for me to tell if she was always pressured into it, whether it started off consensual. I really don't know. He sent her really disgusting rule lists as well as feeding her pornographic content which really did look like grooming (forgot to mention she was underage and 16 at the time, he was
19)

When I confronted her she said that she was sorry, the images were forced, they hooked up maybe 3 times and he forced her to do things that really hurt her, however she said the first time they hooked up was consensual, the others weren't. On that day of confrontation emotions were high, I was broken, shattered, she was breaking down.

She went to the police about it with her parents as support as we are long distance right now, not for long. As it was grooming at the time. And I feel if it was infidelity, she would feel a measure of guilt to ruining another persons life and wouldn't have reported it.

I guess I'm coming here to seek clarification that quite possibly not many people could give. We have had a long relationship, that didn't start off amazing as I had come off of a heap of relationships ending in cheating by the female so this just felt like Deja Vu again. I don't know what it actually looks like to be in a healthy relationship. But I know me and her were doing it right before the incident, and are doing it right again now.
I brought it up to her again not so long ago because of my overthinking on the matter. She says now that it was all unconsensual, she didn't want to send any photos, she didn't want to send any videos. And what she said on the day was fear of repercussions when the perp found out I knew. And she says now, in a rational state of mind she can say that it was all unconsensual.

But internally I am still conflicted, the nature of those first few messages smiling sending him love hearts (only one that I could see) suggested that it was at first flirting, consensual and everything of the sort. But she's sworn on her life that looking back, none of it was. Could her smiling, acting like she liked it all be part of the emotions that come along with manipulation and grooming or could it have been infidelity, and no matter how much l ask, she's not going to budge and confess that it was genuine cheating? His name on her Snapchat was literally ""why are you even here"" which makes me think that was her way of expressing anger when she couldn't directly express it to him. I am honestly lost, have previously forgiven her but am now at a crossroads and I don't know what to think, say or do.

If you have read this all and are willing to respond or PM me l'd be so grateful, this girl has made my life 10 times better when she came into it. And at no point had we had the signs of cheating or loss of feelings in the lead up to this. We were communicating as usual, had heavy affection for eachother and it just seemed so odd.

It was really hurtful and it really stuck with me, I started seeing him differently like he for some reason wanted my virginity in some medieval weird way and my other boyfriend, ""Red""  claimed to be super hurt by this request

I started doing penetration with Red and not with Yellow cause I just wasnt comfortable having sex with Yellow. I felt disgusted by Yellow and little things he did would make me feel like he was gross. I didnt tell anyone that but its what I felt 

Well, after a couple months, while things were really weird between me and them, Red asked to watch me doing penetration with Yellow. I was super super SUPER emotionally dependant of Red, and forced myself to have penetration with Yellow even though I really didnt want to so I could please Red 

It was the weirdest most uncomfortable experience ever. I was nearly crying the whole time and it didnt really work, Yellow left in the middle of it

A few months ago I came out of an 8yr relationship. It was a healthy relationship that ended amicably, people just change a lot in 8yrs. The months before and after the break up have been rough for a mix of reasons, but last week someone came back into my life. I couldn’t remember why we stopped talking, it was a foggy part of my life (drop kick teenager) and a long time ago. I knew it was a bad idea, but I’ve been feeling so unwanted lately I let it happen. I understand that the feelings I have aren’t real, well they don’t reflect reality, but they’re still hard to shake. 

We went out to dinner, and she came back to mine. She asked me if she could kiss me, we made out, she asked/told me to fuck her. That’s when I remembered, when we were hanging out a decade or so ago, why we stopped. I was in a weird place, she was seeing somebody, she told me she left him but she lied.

When I found out I was upset, she kept trying to come on to me, I think she thought it would make it better or something. She kept like putting herself on me, telling me to fuck her or whatever, and I said no, but she would like start crying and tell me she was sorry or whatever, and then eventually she just sort of put me in her (sorry I don’t know how to say that in a non gross way). I think eventually I pushed her off, but for some time I just sort of went along with it, I didn’t want to, but I also didn’t stop it. I don’t know if this was SA, but in retrospect and with my history, it certainly affected me.

Fast forward back to now, when I remembered this I just kind of emotionally froze up about the whole thing and went along with the sex, it was consentual, maybe not enthusiastic, but I said sure or something and went along with it. I think the worst part is I enjoyed it. Next few days I just felt disgusting, like how did I forget, why did I go along with it when I did remember, and how did I put myself in a position I knew was bad for me. I didn’t remember what happened, but, it was a weird and unhealthy relationship we were in way back then and it felt wrong getting back in touch.

I am too afraid to mention this to my boyfriend as this is his childhood best friend. I am unsure what to do. It just didn’t feel quite right. My friend that I was talking to on the phone said she felt quite uncomfortable just by the way he kept on insisting of me drinking/smoking with him. I’m just not quite sure.

15623,1hvkg09,post,Do I have repressed memories of sexual abuse as a child? ,"A couple weeks ago, I experienced what could have been a repressed memory of being SAed as a child by my older brother. At first I thought it was just some twisted idea my brain came up with but now I'm not so sure. Looking back I've always been drawn to reading fanfiction with SA in it. I never enjoyed reading it but I just kept coming back to it. It made me feel like a horrible person even though I would never wish those things on anyone. I also tend to seek out connections with SA survivors. This, combined with me being hyper sexual but also terrified of sex at the same time has never wondering if there is more to this than just an intrusive thought.

15626,1hvkmth,post,i need help with this,"im not even sure if this counts as ""sexual assault"" or even any form of assault or whatever in general, its such a small thing but here's what happened.

me and my boyfriend at the time invited me over to go see a play with him and his parents were taking us and some of his other relatives were gonna go with us too. we get to whatever theater it was and we sit down, and its two of the relatives to the left of me, then him and his parents to the right of me.

he's got a jacket or blanket or something (i cant remember exactly) over his legs and not even 10 minutes in he grabs my hand, puts it under the cover and between his legs and you can fill in the rest there. i remember trying to sort of slowly move my hand away because he's making iy very obvious to everyone around and im clearing just trying to watch this, but he keeps putting it there. im terrified but im not exactly *not* enjoying it, if you get what im saying? i never gave consent (it would be a little strange to in that setting, i guess), and i was trying to move away, but he kept doing it and i felt enjoyment and excitement but also, i didnt want to get caught so i kept trying to move away.

we got to his house after the show ended and we're laying on his couch with both of his parents in the room and he's got a blanket over him again. he takes my fingers and shoves them in his mouth and to be honest, i was fine with that. a little ridiculous you're trying to do this in front of your parents, especially after you told ME off for just laying on your shoulder? yeah but sure, im fine with this. before i know it, he's taking my hand and having me touch his chest and eventually pulls up his shirt and bra (he's trans, in case you were wondering. we both were) and has me touching him again, without any consent, infront of his parents, and with me trying to slowly move away to not get caught because again, im petrified at the thought.

you mighy say that could be some form of sexual assault or whatever you wanna call it, maybe not. whatever term you would use there. the only problem is that i did enjoy it to something extent but i still didnt exactly want it right then and there. i still gave it and did whatever he was trying to get me to do, and told him i enjoyed it and i guess i did to some extent, which is why im hesitant on calling this anything really. he also would make sexual jokes about us in front of people that i wasnt comfortable with and would try to keep doing stuff in public that i would try to kind of stop without telling him stop. but he would tell me off for doing anything (like earlier, laying on his shoulder or whatever, small things like that that werent even sexual at all)  i just need help figuring out what happened here.

15643,m5ubcov,comment,,"Well, it’s possible that it happened, but it’s also possible it didn’t. Memories change each time we recall them—at least on a chemical level. That’s why, if you recall a memory too many times, you might forget certain details, like a face, or fill in gaps with new information that eventually becomes part of the memory itself.

Anxiety or fear during an event can also distort memory. If the event did happen, your brain might have suppressed or altered it to protect you. On the other hand, if it didn’t happen, it’s possible that you accidentally created a false memory—something that’s been shown to happen in studies with consenting individuals.

To figure out whether it’s real or not, try focusing on your earliest memory of the event. Reinforce it only with information you are certain about, and avoid adding details you’re unsure of.

When I was 13 I had attempted my first suicide attempt after my dad beat me so badly I couldn’t take it anymore.

I woke up in a police officers arms and I looked over to see my parents weren’t even scared just annoyed that I had done that they said it was for attention but I wanted an escape from being badly beaten every night. The police saw the neglect and got cfs involved so I was brought to a home (unlocked facility) for kids who need a break from family bs. I got there and instantly I noticed I was the only girl, that within itself made me uncomfortable but it was better then getting beaten so I went along with it. I met a guy who was 17 at the time (zach)he had been put there because his mom was an addict so me and him got along. It was the second day I was there where he had came downstairs when no one was home (all the staff were outside) I was just listening to music and drawing. I noticed something off about him and asked him if he was ok, I wish I never did. He smiled and sat beside me and then grabbed a razor blade out and said to not move. I froze up I didn’t move a muscle he had used the razor blade to cut my clothes off until I was left in my panties. He turned around so I kicked him and tried running but he grabbed me by my hair and threw me on the floor. (This part is really gross just a warning) he took the blade and dug it so deep that he cut a tendon in my leg. I physically couldn’t move and the whole time he threatened to hurt me more if I tried to run again. Finally he let me go (finished in me) as I was crying and he said to stay quiet and to say my leg got caught on a sharp edge of a table.

I got there and instantly I noticed I was the only girl, that within itself made me uncomfortable but it was better then getting beaten so I went along with it. I met a guy who was 17 at the time (zach)he had been put there because his mom was an addict so me and him got along. It was the second day I was there where he had came downstairs when no one was home (all the staff were outside) I was just listening to music and drawing. I noticed something off about him and asked him if he was ok, I wish I never did. He smiled and sat beside me and then grabbed a razor blade out and said to not move. I froze up I didn’t move a muscle he had used the razor blade to cut my clothes off until I was left in my panties. He turned around so I kicked him and tried running but he grabbed me by my hair and threw me on the floor. (This part is really gross just a warning) he took the blade and dug it so deep that he cut a tendon in my leg. I physically couldn’t move and the whole time he threatened to hurt me more if I tried to run again. Finally he let me go (finished in me) as I was crying and he said to stay quiet and to say my leg got caught on a sharp edge of a table. I had wrapped some of my cut teeshirt and wrapped it around my knee and my knees is still fucked to this day its a constant reminder of him and I wish I told my story sooner but now I want to open up about it.

15681,1hyb395,post,I don't know how to feel,"⚠️WARNING MENTION : SEXUAL ASSULT





Please listen and give advice. I'm not brave enough to talk about it with a psychologist or psychiatrist.
I want to ask people online.


I had an older half brother who was 13 years older than me.I was around 7 years old at that time. One night while I was sleeping with him, he began to touch me in the private area. I didn't know what to do so I kept quite. Although I was young but I knew what sexual act was. He continued touching me as much as he could when he live with us before he had to move overseas for work. 

I remember when I was 9, I was in bed with my mom and her boyfriend making out. I pretend to sleep. My mom also made sure I was asleep. I don't know how many minutes after they were done, my mom bf started to touch me as well. My best friend dad would touch me everytime my best friend goes away for a while. Mind you I was a kid. I didn't know how to bring it up to my parents. I don't know what their reaction is going to be so I kept quite. 

As a kid  I knew my mom had a multiple of sexual affair with her friends and I even caught them but I pretended not to have seen them. To be honest I don't even know the reason why my mom brought me with her when she meets with her affairs partner. I wasn't allowed to talk about my dad or the fact I had a dad. I think she was playing victim as a single mom to take advantage of guys for money. She always brings me and not my brother. I guess having a daughter would gain more sympathy. 

People tend to be traumatised after experiencing this kind of things but to me, I felt nothing. To me it was somehow normal. I'm now 21 years old. Sexual assault survivors usually may have trouble trusting others, feeling safe in the world, avoiding persons who look like the attacker, blaming themselves for actions taken or not taken at the time of the assault, and avoiding relationships and sexual intimacy.
Its not the case for me. I'm fine with intimacy. Actually I find my self get excited when people start touching me. Is this how I cope?. I sometimes have the  thought of getting assaulted. I know it's wrong but somehow I grew up normally as normal I can get.

Is there some kind of trauma I should be experiencing that I don't realise? I talk to my friends about it for the first time  and her reaction got me thinking that what I'm feeling about this whole thing isn't supposed to take it lightheartedly.



Should I talk to a therapist? I mean to me it's nothing seriouss

Edit: I live an average life. There weren't any abuse or drug or alcohol involved. My step dad is the dad I could hope for. I am an affair baby so I never met my dad but my step dad is the only dad I know. My mom wasn't really in my life that much. To be honest she neglected me most of the time, other than using me as leverage. ","I don't know how to feel ⚠️WARNING MENTION : SEXUAL ASSULT

I had an older half brother who was 13 years older than me.I was around 7 years old at that time. One night while I was sleeping with him, he began to touch me in the private area. I didn't know what to do so I kept quite. Although I was young but I knew what sexual act was. He continued touching me as much as he could when he live with us before he had to move overseas for work. 

I remember when I was 9, I was in bed with my mom and her boyfriend making out. I pretend to sleep. My mom also made sure I was asleep. I don't know how many minutes after they were done, my mom bf started to touch me as well. My best friend dad would touch me everytime my best friend goes away for a while. Mind you I was a kid. I didn't know how to bring it up to my parents. I don't know what their reaction is going to be so I kept quite. 

As a kid  I knew my mom had a multiple of sexual affair with her friends and I even caught them but I pretended not to have seen them. To be honest I don't even know the reason why my mom brought me with her when she meets with her affairs partner. I wasn't allowed to talk about my dad or the fact I had a dad. I think she was playing victim as a single mom to take advantage of guys for money. She always brings me and not my brother. I guess having a daughter would gain more sympathy. 

People tend to be traumatised after experiencing this kind of things but to me, I felt nothing. To me it was somehow normal. I'm now 21 years old. Sexual assault survivors usually may have trouble trusting others, feeling safe in the world, avoiding persons who look like the attacker, blaming themselves for actions taken or not taken at the time of the assault, and avoiding relationships and sexual intimacy.
Its not the case for me. I'm fine with intimacy. Actually I find my self get excited when people start touching me. Is this how I cope?. I sometimes have the  thought of getting assaulted. I know it's wrong but somehow I grew up normally as normal I can get.

Is there some kind of trauma I should be experiencing that I don't realise? I talk to my friends about it for the first time  and her reaction got me thinking that what I'm feeling about this whole thing isn't supposed to take it lightheartedly.



Should I talk to a therapist? I mean to me it's nothing seriouss

Edit: I live an average life. There weren't any abuse or drug or alcohol involved. My step dad is the dad I could hope for. I am an affair baby so I never met my dad but my step dad is the only dad I know. My mom wasn't really in my life that much. To be honest she neglected me most of the time, other than using me as leverage. ",5,1.0,2025-01-10 18:24,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hyb395/i_dont_know_how_to_feel/,Neutral
15682,1hybe83,post,Guilt for reporting ,"Long story short, a guy with seniority from work got me so drunk I could barely walk or speak. He took me home and forced himself on me.

I wasn’t going to report it as I kept on blaming myself as I was drunkenly flirting with him too before the 3 shots he fed me. 

I reported him a week after he SAd me. I finally made the choice to report it because I went to the ER to get checked as I was still hurting and spotting from the SA.

That nagging feeling that something happened, combined with everything you’ve gone through—neglect, a chaotic childhood, and now the situation with your cousin—makes it totally understandable that you’re feeling overwhelmed and unsure. It’s 100% ok to question your past, especially if you’re noticing signs that align with what others experience after trauma. Even if you don’t have clear memories, your feelings matter, and they deserve attention 💯

Memory gaps, especially from childhood, can happen when our brains are trying to protect us. It’s okay if you’re not sure whether to try to remember or let it be right now. Healing isn’t about rushing for answers—it’s about taking small steps toward feeling safe and supported. Talking to a trauma-informed therapist could help, even just to process your current emotions without pressure to dig into the past. If therapy feels too much, journaling or connecting with a support group can be a good start. I was kidnapped when I was a child and I have gaps - so I get it :/

Above all, be kind to yourself. Whatever happened—or didn’t—you’re allowed to feel pain and confusion. Take it at your own pace 👊🫶"," This was hard to read as a dad 😟

15715,1hyeq8p,post,Is this sexual assault? ,"I had just turned 9 a month ago when we went to visit my aunt and extended family overseas (this was the first time I had seen her). She didn't speak English so there was a bit of a language barrier, making it slightly more difficult to communicate with her and my cousins. I was visiting with my parents and my younger sister, who had at the time just turned 6. On one of the days my parents and aunt went out into town together, leaving me and my sister with our grandmother and our, back then, 14 year old cousin. My cousin was showing us how to draw birds and our grandmother, who was diabetic, was extremely tired so she layed down for a short nap. Whilst she was asleep and my sister was occupied in the corner drawing, my cousin told me to stick my tongue out. Back then I didn't understand what he said, so he gestured what he wanted me to do. Confused I stuck my tongue out and he then used his to touch and move over mine. Even though I found it extremely disgusting and uncomfortable, I didn't understand what was going on and just left my tongue out for him to explore as I was afraid to hurt his feelings and I didn't want to upset the cousin who I had just met. When my parents came back and he heard the key turn in the lock, he immediately stopped and resumed showing me how draw birds before leaving the room. I have not seem him since but have started thinking about this event a lot lately. Therefore I want to ask is this sexual assault or not?

15717,1hyew74,post,Facing my SA past finally,"Hi all. I’ve been looking for resources and/or community. I recently had a hard session with my therapist, finally speaking about a specific SA incident that happened and has haunted me for about 15 years now. 

I was about 16, dating my then-abuser. He was abusive in all manners, but this one incident really fucked me over. I was SA’d by him and it also involved an animal. 

I have felt shame and disgust with myself since then. I felt like it was a dirty secret that had to die with me. I told him to his face that I’d have to live with what happened for the rest of my life, but of course he didn’t care. He just wanted to break me down and continue controlling me. 

Fast forward to now, it’s surfacing and I’m trying to deal with it. However, I can’t find ANYTHING about victims of that kind of SA. It’s all about the people who commit the crime, or studies of minors committing the act. I asked my therapist if she had any resources the other day, but all she offer at the moment was checking in with the local university’s veterinary social work department, but I wondered around their website and still, nothing. 

I just don’t want to feel alone, I want to know people that got better from this. Anything is appreciated. My therapist did say it’s a lot more common than you’d think, but why can’t I find anything about it online? ","Facing my SA past finally Hi all. I’ve been looking for resources and/or community.

15725,1hygewj,post,Scary Tinder Experience,"

Trigger Warning, Harassment mentions of sexual abuse 

Hello, this happened today. I'm posting from mobile and I'm pretty freaked out so I apologize if this is incoherent or hard to follow. 

I matched with a man on tinder. We switched to talking on telegram where he gave me several red flags. We had only been messaging for a couple hours so I just gave him a kind message saying I didn't think we were compatible. He then proceeded to send me this insanely long scary horrible confession. It was written as a narrative as him as the hero. But it was just a confession to sexually assaulting multiple people. 

He has my telegram info and could easily find me if he wanted to. 

Hes from out of state and only visiting my area for a short period of time. I did manage to dig around and see that his background was legit. So I don't think I'm in serious danger and he will leave my state soon. 

I'm just like completely freaked out. I am a survivor of abuse and it's been really triggering. I have mental illness and really horrible interactions with the police because of it and I am even more terrified to go to them. 

So I'm just scared and don't know what to do. I live with my parents and told them, it was not a very validating experience. So I'm just feeling so stupid and scared. 

If anyone can give me any advice on what to do. Or just some kind words I would really appreciate it. 

This whole experience has been so surreal and bizarre I'm totally in shock. I've never had anything like this happen to me before. ","Scary Tinder Experience

She inched her hands to my sides side and grabbed close to under my breasts. I told her to stop and then she reached all the way forward and grabbed my breasts and fully squeezed, hard. I was not wearing a bra of any kind. She laughed at her hilarious joke and I got up and stormed out. I forgot about it for years and we never spoke of it. I remembered the event when I was about 17 and it makes me so sick. She still touches my lower back, waist, or butt when we hug and I've told her so many times not to and that it makes me uncomfortable when ANYONE touches me there and I tell everyone not to. She just laughs and responds ""cmon I'm your mom!"" Exactly, so why do you want to touch and grab me there? I feel physically unsafe around her and have dreams of her trying to go further. I want this weight off of me but it would crush her to have a serious discussion about this. She would just cry, say she's a bad mom, and then probably not change the way she touches me at all. She has a habit of reacting to conflict this way. My therapist recommended I write her a letter but now I work with her fiancé and it's all so awkward and uncomfortable. How do I cope with this? Is this even considered sexual assault? It feels like it was.","Did my mom sexually assault me?

15750,1hyjhlo,post,My Ups and Downs with Healing,"(24f) I spoke to my therapist today, and it felt great. I don’t want to talk about my SA again because it feels like I’m reopening a wound every time, but I know it’s part of the healing process. Right now, I want to focus on myself and what I need to finish and accomplish this year.

Looking back, I wish I hadn’t put myself in that situation and had just accepted that it’s okay not to have experience. Initially, I wanted to start dating because I felt pressured seeing my younger sister having these experiences with men, even though they weren’t good ones. I thought, *Fine, let me start dating now.* But reality hit me instead, realizing how some guys can take advantage, cross boundaries, and get what they want. It’s so hurtful, so deeply hurtful.

But I’m healing, and that’s what’s important to me now. I’m practicing my affirmations and slowly getting better. Still, I sometimes feel like there’s this little voice telling me to text my assaulter and get revenge, or at least make his pockets hurt. Part of me thinks about making him spoil me or just sending him an Apple Cash request if he bothers me again, but I don’t have the guts to follow through with that.

I hate that he texted me and unsent the messages. It’s been driving me crazy because I want to know what he had to say. Part of me wants to lead him on and then tell him off, but I know that’s just my hurt talking. He took advantage of me, and I hate that, but I need to focus on my healing.","My Ups and Downs with Healing (24f) I spoke to my therapist today, and it felt great.

To answer your question, we would need to know the events leading up to the point at which they had sex.

Or did he pressure and badger her until she gave in and let him penetrate her in some way?  No one here could possibly say either way whether it was rape without knowing more about what actually happened.  Also, it is most likely statutory rape, due to the ages of the parties involved.  Theoretically, they both could get into trouble, because neither one of them is old enough to legally consent to sexual activity with the other.  But unfortunately, what the boy is going to learn from this experience is that pressuring people gets you what you want, unless an adult steps in and reads him the riot act.  I recommend discussing the situation with a teacher or guidance counselor you trust (feel free to leave out the names of the people involved), to see what they say.  If you don't like the answer, try someone else.  And google the civil code for rape and sexual assault in your jurisdiction, so you understand exactly what that entails, since where you live can make a big difference.

This is assault. You said no. You expressed discomfort. He ignored you, got you drunk, and took advantage of the situation.

15786,1hylmst,post,Anal Assault?,"Hello. 
My boyfriend and I were drinking and taking molly. He did about half the amount for both alcohol and molly that I did. We were being intimate and I told him no anal whatsoever. He pushed a little and asked if he could do oral with my butt hole and external massage. I agreed. He tried to press his finger into the hole a few times and each time I squirmed away. After a few times I got irritated and told him to stay away from the butt hole completely. He agreed and apologized. 
After a while, he tried inserting the tip of his finger to my anus. I shrieked, closed my legs, and said ""no stop it"". He held up his hands and said ""sorry, I won't do it again. I'll leave it alone. I promise."" We continued being intimate for likely another 1.5hrs after that, and 4-6 times (can't remember exact) he again put this tip of his finger in my anus. Each time my reaction was the same and his was as well (apologizing, saying hed leave it alone). Then he finally did leave it alone and we finished our night. The next day when I sobered up I was thinking intently about it, and it felt so wrong. I felt so violated once I thought about it in a sober mind. I became physically ill from how distraught I was, and ended up vomiting three times. 
I have broken up with him.
He thinks because he doesn't remember it the way I do, and because we continued being intimate after, he did not assault me. I feel violated. I feel assaulted. Was I?

15794,1hymmn1,post,Question for anyone (possible trigger warning),"I’m just on here to say something that I’ve been holding in for about a year and I can’t really tell people I know right now. 

I have a memory that has come up due to an emotional event that happened to someone close to me. I have been seeing a therapist to work these memories out. 
Here is the memory:
I remember when I lived at my mom’s house I was in the kitchen, walked to her room which I rarely go in, and got under the covers to take a nap? TW: I only remember waking up with my pants to my ankles laying on my back, very confused and wondering what time of the day it is. Right when I woke up, I felt weird. I put my clothing back on and get up very quickly to see if anyone’s home. My mom and sister who lived here were not home. I didn’t even know where my dog was (he’s always by me), and the front door was open. I honestly convinced myself it was a ghost..? 

Should I be concerned that I may have been drugged? I have no memory of that day; I don’t remember what I was doing before or after. I do remember sort of waking up but it felt like sleep paralysis, I was too weak to fully wake up, then I fell back asleep, then I woke up. I don’t know why but I checked my boyfriend’s location. My boyfriend was at his own house; also my bf would never hurt me. Some people know where I live, and the neighbor is potentially a dangerous person. 

Another addition: about a year after I think this memory happened, my mothers bf cat called me (whistled) and I just so happened to be wearing the same shorts I was wearing when I was taking the nap. I’m unsure of what to think. I don’t know if theres memories that are repressed, I know I need time but I would just wanna know cuz I feel like my world is upside down rn and it’s messing with my relationships and I’m actually feeling similar symptoms as to when I had a similar situation happen to me (sa) about a decade ago (I’ve healed from that). Hope this makes sense and I’m open to hearing anything if anyone’s willing. Thank you for taking the time to read this.

15801,1hynnam,post,is this assault? ,"so i have even assaulted before a lot when i was younger by adults and friends in middle school so as i’ve gotten older i have learned to steer clear. 

anyways i 18f started dating this guy 21m, when he first started staying the night the first few nights he did try to and it was honestly terrifying for me and i would struggle so hard to say no like we almost started a few times just because i was so scared but i would leave the room last minute and just wouldn’t say anything like it was literally freeze response then flight. i ended up telling him i had trauma around it.

i feel like that’s important because it plays into it as me literally leaving the room (and coming back crying btw) and him immediately trying to start back is such. 🚩 this was just my first like. ig adult relationship. i was a virgin; unfortunately. 

anyways so like two weeks ago or one week ago he was staying over and woke me up saying he wanted to. i said no. like plain as day. then he woke me up again a few minutes later but this time he got on top of me and said it more forcefully and i like shoved and said no or like a noice that was clearly no. 
and then again ten minutes later but this time he just picked me up and put me in a position. and i woke up like scared and just froze and didn’t move and just gave up because i said no twice?
the whole time i was silent and unresponsive, he even said i was silent and unresponsive and that he felt guilty afterwards but i brought it up first before he could.

he said he was thinking about it in the moment about how i was quiet on not doing anything but he didn’t stop? 


anyways i broke up with him and idk like ever since it happened i was sorta avoiding him, and keeping myself so busy to the point i couldn’t the i about it because i didn’t want to at all. but that time i didn’t say no and technically he did like stop the other two times but he kept pushing every few minutes? anytime he said he didn’t want to or he didn’t feel good i always said okay and we just kept doing whatever we were doing before i asked because like even if i wanted to rlly bad i love him id never make him or make him feel like he has to.

no one knows no friends not my mom. my friends don’t even know i lost my virginity (my mom does) because i never really wanted to loose it but i was thinking i had to eventually anyways but i can’t tell anyone. i jsut feel like im drowning right now","is this assault?  so i have even assaulted before a lot when i was younger by adults and friends in middle school so as i’ve gotten older i have learned to steer clear.

15810,1hypjlj,post,is it really? ,"I've been struggling with being confidently sexually active my whole life, and I couldn't really make out what was the reason for it. 
The big problem for me was feeling disgusted by the sight of male genetalia that I couldn't really overcome. But these days, when I met my bf and my situation started getting better I remembered one episode. 

Me and my friend, both 10 years old, very prim and proper A-students, having a walk in our school yard. Suddenly we saw a man walking in our direction, and continued walking towards him until we saw his genetalia proudly sticking out, partially bare, partially wrapped in some kind of bandages. For me it was the first time seeing fully grown man's genetalia. The man seemed drunk and overall weird, so we turned around and walked as fast as we could and then ran. 

I don't really consider this to be an assault, since nobody touched me or practically did anything, but seems like this episode defined my attitude towards sex and sexual behaviour for years. How do I call it? I feel kinda weak because something this simple turned out to affect me this much, but try to remind myself I was just a kid.  ","is it really?

15816,1hypvqp,post,How do I cope with the fact that my rapist was my best friend.,"

So I’m still new to Reddit but if you look on my account I posted to how my best friend SA’d + raped me then forced me to give in to sex with her, so I guess also sexual coercion. I also posted and vented about the incident on r/advice, (I think that’s what it’s called.) because I was so confused about how to feel.

It’s been a couple months since then but I don’t exactly know how to cope with the fact that the person I trusted/loved the most is, or WAS my rapist. I actually had a panic attack 2 days before Christmas because I kept getting fucking flashbacks about the incident. I couldn’t even sleep in my bed for weeks because that’s where everything took place. My shitty boyfriend hasn’t taken the time to try and understand where I’m coming from. He doesn’t understand that I said no to her advances, and won’t take the time to understand what “Sexual coercion” is, and how I was quite literally forced into sex. To him it’s all bullshit, and to him, I was getting assaulted at first until I gave in and consented. Actually, this all happened while I was sleeping, I didn’t even know what was happening at first. 

The thing is, my abuser was my best friend since high school, and WAS my soulmate/best friend for literally all my life. I thought that if I could make my life apart of her life, my problems would solve because she would take care of them for me. She was always there for me, and the fact that she did something so horrible, like actually not respecting me when I said no to her, it’s actually shocking. I haven’t even told my therapist about all this shit and how I really feel about everything.

My mother actually was really supportive. I moved in with her for a few days to just let loose for a bit, (I’m still currently here) but everything is still going around in circles for me. Also, I apologize if I’m venting as if I’m on a FaceTime call with you people, its just I need to let this all out, or maybe I should talk to my therapist about this instead of going to Reddit thinking it will actually solve everything. But it’s just like, everyone and everything is so shitty now, I just wanna be free. I’m not gonna talk about my teen years to much, but during all my teen years (before I met my abuser) I was in and out of mental hospitals, smoking at an early age, jumping in my friend’s cars late at night, doing horrible at school, and cooping with alcohol and what not. Well, it’s not like my whole life was just sunshine and rainbows after I met my abuser/ex best friend, it’s just like, maybe I thought she opened up a spark in my life that I thought would be better for me, and now it’s just like all gone.

If there are any other SA or Sexual coercion victims or anyone who knows what it’s like, please tell me how to cope. Because I’m seriously loosing my mind here.

They asked again but in a ""cmon can i just please kiss you"" way a second time not even minutes later. I said the same thing and they gave an ""aww okay"" kind of response

That next morning not even 24 hours later they made a comment that its statutory rape cause we're both 17. I was shocked and kept asking them what they meant.

(Note when we had just sat down for the ride home i had hit somerhing saying ""fuck me!"" Cause it hurt, them responding with ""thats a little early in our relationship~!""

Really struggling a bit with this today. 

TW for potential sexual abuse detail. 

I posted yesterday but it wasn't complete 🙈 sorry. 

So this is the hazest memory i have which kind of fits with when i started experiencing dissociation around 7/8 years old ? Potentially   youngest i was was 6? 

So i remember a particular pair of pink pjama bottoms, the top had a white front bit and pink long arms. I feel sick remembering them honestly, like theres a pit in my stomach. I remember a feeling of fingers touching in these PJ bottoms and the pants themselves having been moved around/twisted when i woke up later. No faces come to mind but my parents knew some dodgy people who would just come into the house when they felt like it and even in the middle of the night. 

But then i know me and my brother shared a room at that point so would someone have really done that? I remember feeling like i had to keep it a secret. I think i only know a vague age because i remember these pjs have ages 6-7 on them ive no idea why that detail i remember or even if any of this is true. I mean i could have just been exploring myself right? But the whole things feels wrong and is stuck in the back of my brain and i can't get it out. 

Could this have actually happened? 

I always used to have dreams of people coming for me, breaking down doors and coming to take me away. But this could just be normal childhood nightmares. Theres one specific one when i remember an adult but they were a monster and had these long claws and they clawed through the toilet door which is where i would always hide when upset and lock myself in. 

I don't know if i just had an over active imagination. I don't know what i want with this post i'm just wondering if im making things out to be worse than they are, likely nothing happened. ","Could this have really happened?

After the injection, he rubbed roughly around the injection site and his fingers touched my anus again.   Like it felt like he was rubbing his finger around my butthole.  Then he said ok and sat there smiling at me while I pulled my underwear and pants back up.  I was literally shaking and felt like I was going to throw up or faint or pass out. At least that’s how I remember it. 

I talked to a couple of people and they said they thought those things were glute injections, but it felt soooo creepy and weird.   

Is my brain making too much of it because of past trauma or was it sexual assault?  I HATE being so hyper focused or aware on every interaction with a man because I’m terrified of what might happen.

I brought a friend with me, and at first it was fine, he offered some local anhestesia and i refused, and prepared for the pain. While preparing the jewels and the needle, he made some weird comments about how he would rather pierce a hot women, since man act weird with him. I felt unconfortable with this, but laughed and decided to keep going. 

After the first needle, i passed out and woke up on the floor, i had pissed myself from the pain, and my friend was holding my head while my teacher was standing, laughing about the situation.

I layed down on the litter, and told him to finish the piercing, joking that now i cant pass out and fall on the floor.

He then continued to put the piercing, and i screamed from the pain. He said that i had a ""very sexy moan"" and that ""my boyfriend must be lucky to hear me scream this loud in his bed"". I was in so much paint that i couldn't say anything, and then he went to pierce the other nipple and kept making jokes about my ""moaning"" (i was screaming from pain).

Before we went to bed, he said that he had feelings for me. I didn’t know how to react (he was still in the closet). So I just shook it off with a joke.

When the lights turned off, he forced himself onto me and started sniffing my neck. He forcefully prevented me from pushing him off. He started touching my face and humping me. He said really gross things. I was in complete shock. I told him he had one minute to get off or else I’d get mad.

After the minute, he saw that I was making a scene so he stopped and returned to his sleeping area. 

The next morning he did the same things to me while I was still in my sleep. I feel so disgusted and tired so I just looked away, hoping it would end. He even took pictures of my face when he was on top of me.

He didn’t force me to have sex, but I still felt violated.

I don’t know what to do… should I confront him for his actions? Should I tell the other friends in the group and potentially just ruin the group? Will his life be ruined if I speak out against him? I really don’t want to make a scene, since he was still someone I considered a good friend.

Before we went to bed, he said that he had feelings for me. I didn’t know how to react (he was still in the closet). So I just shook it off with a joke.

When the lights turned off, he forced himself onto me and started sniffing my neck. He forcefully prevented me from pushing him off. He started touching my face and humping me. He said really gross things. I was in complete shock. I told him he had one minute to get off or else I’d get mad.

After the minute, he saw that I was making a scene so he stopped and returned to his sleeping area. 

The next morning he did the same things to me while I was still in my sleep. I feel so disgusted and tired so I just looked away, hoping it would end. He even took pictures of my face when he was on top of me.

He didn’t force me to have sex, but I still felt violated.

I don’t know what to do… should I confront him for his actions? Should I tell the other friends in the group and potentially just ruin the group? Will his life be ruined if I speak out against him? I really don’t want to make a scene, since he was still someone I considered a good friend.

15905,1hz4rsr,post,I think my grandmother molested me (21 F) when I was a child,"When I was a little girl I spent most of my time with my grandmother since both of my parents were in the army. She always used to do stuff that made me uncomfortable but I didn’t think much about it at the time. Most of the time she made her inappropriate touching a game or a joke. A reoccurring game would be one where she would touch a body part and ask who it belongs to. For example, she would touch my leg and ask who does it belong to and I would say it belongs to her. Then she would proceed to do that with my hands, and at the end with my vagina. One time when she was laying on her bed she pushed my head onto her vagina. It lasted for a bit and she told me to smell it. She was laughing and smiling when she did it. I also have a faint memory of her touching my vagina unprompted and saying that she loves me, but sometimes that feels like a dream that didn’t happen. The only time I remember saying no to her is when she was chasing me and my little cousin, saying give me your vagina trying to touch us, and we were both covering our private parts saying no. She would also imply that we were slutty even though we were so young. She always warned me of men and sexual predators, which led me to live a paranoid and anxious life as a kid. There was a time she slapped me for laughing too much. There was another time that she was trying to teach me how to cook and it wasn’t an electrical stove, so we had to use matches. I was trying to light the stove with a match but it wasn’t working and I asked her if I could stop because I was burning myself. But she just pushed my hand and kept it in place while it was hurting me. When I moved my hand away from the stove when she said I could stop, I noticed that part of my nail had melted. She always threatened to hit me and my cousin. I was kinda like a therapist to her, she would talk about her trauma a lot in graphic detail, which disturbed me. She would always scream at me, saying I’m gross and can’t take care of myself, and that I have abandoned myself. One time she showed me a picture of a woman with an anus as a mouth. I think she would slap my butt sometimes but it’s kinda blurry. She would also always make comments about how big my butt was. She would also make comments about my legs all the time, about how much meat was in them. One time she even accused me and my cousin of being lesbians for each other. She would always I am your mother, your grandmother, your sister, your best friend, your everything. And that’s how it was, so when I was 18 and my repressed memories of her resurfaced, I was horrified and felt extremely loss. Cps came to my house because my therapist reported what happened. And that’s how my grandmother learned that I was accusing her of molesting me. She said that she does not remember that, that she would never do that. She also said that cps told her they didn’t believe me, and that I was mentally ill and making it up. Sometimes it feels like everything that happened when I was a child was a joke and that I’m overreacting. But I can’t help but feel violated by her. I don’t know what to do with myself or how I feel.

There was one guy in particular who I made out with a couple of times at school parties (8+ years ago) who went. At first he was very nice and we had a catch up. When it got later, a lot of people had gone to bed. We were sat in the kitchen talking and having a general catch up. We were sat with a seat inbetween us and he kept telling me to move closer to him, which I said no to. He eventually said 'fine I'll move there myself' and did so. As he was being so forward and slightly creepy, I decided to call it a night. I was staying over at the party, but he wasn't. He then proceeded to follow me up the stairs and block me from getting to the bedroom. There was a study type room inbetween all the bedrooms, and he kept telling me to go in there with him. I kept saying no, and asking him what for, to which he would just laugh. I said 'no, i don't want to' that many times, that the situation started to give me chills. I tried to get to my room, but he grabbed my waist and wouldn't let me pass. I tried again, and he then proceeded to grab me so forcefully, that i nearly fell backwards down the stairs. I told him I wanted to go, to which he laughed in my face. I told him he was starting to scare me. At one point, he started to physically push me inside the room. I knew no matter what, I could not go in there, as I didn't (or maybe did) know what would happen. He held me so tightly, that I knew I wouldn't stand a chance fighting him. I managed to break from his grip and ran down the stairs, to a room where a lot of the guys were sleeping, to try and wake them up. The guy followed me and then proceeded to grab my face to try and kiss me. I pushed him off and woke up one of the guys, who insatntly understood what was happening, just by my face. He then pleaded with me to go to the kitchen with him, another empty room, to which I again, kept saying no to. He had a can in his hands and kept angrily breaking it apart. Eventually he went home, and I broke down. I have never been in a situation where I felt that close to being in trouble before, and I'm really unsure what would've happened, had I gone into that room. Luckily, the guy I woke up was amazing, and protected me from that point. He told me not to gaslight myself into thinking it was no big deal, and that the guy probably had pretty bad intentions. The guy messaged me as soon as he got home apologising if he came on too hard, and he also double messaged another apology later. I have not replied and I am unsure whether to. I have felt sick ever since, and just wanted any thoughts on this.","I think I was almost potentially SAd and I feel sick  I went to a party last night that was largely a school reunion, of people I hadn't seen for 5 years.

There are days I wish I didn't remember and had kept it all a secret.  My therapist reminds me on such days that it wasn't easy back then either.  Damned if you do, damned if you don't. 

I know others who have been alone for a long time because they don't keep secrets, keeping it 💯.   In the end, it might take time, but you deserve to have someone who accepts you for who you really are.",4,,2025-01-11 23:51,t3_1hz3ndr,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hz3ndr/i_should_a_tell_my_future_partner_about_my_rape/m6nrmz5/,Neutral

15969,1hza93p,post,I don’t know how to be more assertive when setting boundaries ,"I was sexually abused by an old ex-boyfriend for 3 years when I was 18-21 years old, I am 27 years old now. 

This has affected the way I see sex in general. Therapy has helped a lot, and I am able to openly talk about my previous trauma with new partners, family and friends. 

For context: I have been dating someone for 2 months (28M), and I have been honest with him from the start. I told him I needed to take things slow and that I don’t like aggressive behavior. I explicitly told him my boundaries before meeting in person and talked about my abusive relationship and how it affected me to help him understand why. He was very respectful at first, but last time we met he broke most if not all my boundaries (for example, I told him I don’t like when men touch my butt or making out in public, last time, he wouldn’t stop trying kissing me with tongue or groping me when we were outside). When this happened, I told him I didn’t like it, and that he should stop, he was laughing and I was smiling at him because I just froze. I thought by telling him in advance the things I don’t like I wouldnt find myself in an uncomfortable situation, but it happened. 

I told him the above over text, at first he told me he likes me so much he finds it hard to stop the temptation to touch me. And that he was doing it in a playful way. When he realized I was actually upset about the situation, he apologized and told me he feels bad for what he did. He has apologized many times, but I feel bad and I am not sure if I will be able to feel safe around him again. 

I can’t stop thinking about the whole thing and how nice it would be to be more assertive. I hate to freeze when I find myself in stressful situations like this one. How did you overcome this fear to say “no” in person?

I heard this idea that really stuck with me; your body WANTS to burn x number of calories (like a budget). If you don’t burn it physically, it’s only other outlet is chemically. This often leads to a persons system working in overdrive leading to stress and wakefulness. When you exercise your body has a caloric outlet and this is why people who regularly exercise often report better energy, mood, and sleep levels.

I say this because while I wouldn’t rule out your difficulties sleeping being SA related, I more often hear that being tied to flashbacks and night terrors and not so much a general wakefulness at night."," This is going to sound out of left field, but do you exercise or walk often?

16017,1hzfpjl,post,i need an opinion. TIA. (TW: Mention of SA),"i have been seeing a guy for about a month. we have hung out 6 times and at first it was going extremely well.  i told him i wanted to take things slow and he was very respectful of that and didn’t try to make any moves on me. after hanging out the first couple times we held hands and cuddled in the bed of his truck, but it didn’t go any further than that. we’ve had a lot of deep conversations and we have a lot in common and i felt so comfortable around him, we clicked immediately. so i was enjoying my time with him and excited to see where things could potentially go because it usually takes time for me to warm up to someone and feel comfortable and not awkward around them. but with him it felt like it could be different. he started showing signs of attachment issues and clinginess very early on which worried me a bit. after our first hang out, we had a miscommunication over txt message about hanging out for a second time and he thought i didnt want to see him and got upset. i got upset because i was looking forward to seeing him again and got all ready to hang out. i let him know i was upset and he walked to my house in 20° weather to apologize. mind you he only lives like 3 or 4 blocks away and at the time i thought of it as endearing and sweet, but everyone else i told thought it was strange since we had only hung out once. i can now see their point of view given some other things he’s said or scenarios that have happened. he has told me multiple times that he’s worried bc he feels like he’s becoming addicted to me and doesn’t want to lose me and that he is that no one has ever made him feel the way i make him feel. i mean these things are nice to hear, but i feel like it’s a bit of a red flag this early on. 
anyways, after hanging out a couple of times, getting to know each other on a deeper level, holding hands and cuddling there was tension growing. we both mentioned how we wanted to kiss each other so bad but then he said that he wants to take things slow bc he really likes me and doesn’t want to mess things up. he also said he’s never made out with a girl and not had sex with her the same night. to which i replied “we’ll have to change that”. i am not the type of girl to sleep with a guy the same day we have our first kiss. in my last relationship we were together 3 months and made out numerous times and i never slept with him. i just cannot have “meaningless” “fun sex”, i have to feel comfortable enough with a person and trust them to be able to have sex with them (which i told this guy). i was also S/A’d as a child and very sexualized by my last partner, that’s all he wanted me for and never truly cared about me (the guy i was with for 3 months and didn’t sleep with). so this has made it even more hard for me to do sexual things; which i told this current guy this. like i said, he was VERY respectful about it at first which was so nice. fast forward to the 5th time we hung out. we ended up kissing and things got a bit heated. he ended up f!ngering me, which i was fine with in the moment, but he wanted to take it further and have sex.  i said i didn’t want to and he asked why and i was just like “i wanted to take things slow”. we ended up making out again and i kept having to let him know that this wasn’t going to lead to sex. at one point when we stopped kissing, he started breathing all weird and heavy and i asked if he was okay and he said “i am trying to calm myself down because i dont want to lose control”. that got me kind of worried bc i didn’t know what he meant by “lose control”. at that point i was thinking to myself that we need to stop because i dont want this to go any further. during this specific time, we were in the bed of his truck because we liked to stargaze together (i know its winter, but we had sleeping bags, blankets and wore warm clothes) it started to snow so he ended up taking me home and that was the end of that night. 
the next day we hung out again at my house and put on a movie. we were just cuddling at first but about 20 min into the movie he grabbed my chin and signaled that he wanted to kiss. we ended up making out again. i stopped our kiss because i just wanted to watch the movie and i knew if we continued then things would get heated again. he grabbing my chin and so i would kiss him and once again, one thing lead to another and he started f!ngering me again. he was doing it for about 5-10 minutes and again, i was fine with it but in the back of my mind i knew that if i let it continue he would think i was going to have sex with him and i didn’t want to give him a false idea. i scratched his back and once again he said that i needed to stop doing that bc if i didnt he might “lose control”. at that point i got very overwhelmed. i could feel that i was beginning to possibly have a panic attack. i felt like i could not move and my arms were shaking uncontrollably. he cuddled me and comforted me and i was able to calm myself down before i actually had a full on panic attack. after that he started kissing me again and let me just add that i am personally completely fine with kissing, i love kissing, i could do it for hours and still be able to have self control. but i need to remember that is not the same mindset that everyone has which was in the back of my mind the whole time. he ended up trying to f!nger me again but i just did not want that, especially after how my body reacted before. i moved his hand away and he moved it back. then i moved it again and he moved it back again. i moved his hand like 4 times and then he grabbed both my hands and held them down so that i couldn’t move his hand and proceeded to put his finger in me. i was able to get out of his grip and immediately moved his hand and he asked “what are you doing?” to which i replied, “what are YOU doing??” and then he asked why i didn’t want him to continue and i was just like i just don’t want to. he respected that and we stopped and i talked to him (once again) about the reasons why i just cannot have sex with someone this quickly. now i know i didn’t verbally tell him to stop, but i feel like moving his hand more than once should have put my point across. 
what i need an opinion on:
 1. what would this be considered? i would definitely consider this S/A, but i told my mom the whole thing and she says that it is object r^pe. i was confused because he used his finger, not an object. i tried looking it up but i only found mixed answers. if someone can please educate me on that, i would appreciate it. 
2: am i in the wrong for continuing to make out with him and “rile him up”? my mom was saying that if i don’t want him to try and have sex with me or expect it then i shouldn’t be making out with him and letting him do foreplay. (she said this after the first time we kissed, before the S/A happened) however, i told him that i was not going to have sex with him more than once before. i feel like if you know that you can’t control your sexual urges and you know that making out with someone is going to make you “lose control” then maybe you shouldn’t be making out? especially when you know my intentions and also considering how my body reacted before. i don’t know. i also feel like i’ve tried making it out to not be a big deal or that it was also my fault since i was continuing to make out with him and let him f!nger me before. 
i think those are the only questions i have, at least for now. i don’t know if this info is helpful, but i am a 22 y/o F and hes 25 y/o M. as of right now i have told him i think we shouldn’t see each other and he seems to be being respectful of that. it is very unfortunate because i felt so comfortable around him and that i could tell him anything without judgement and i just thought this time it would be different, but it is what it is. thank you so much to anyone who replies and reads all of that. i hope it all makes sense and isn’t too all over the place.

(TW: Mention of SA) i have been seeing a guy for about a month. we have hung out 6 times and at first it was going extremely well.  i told him i wanted to take things slow and he was very respectful of that and didn’t try to make any moves on me. after hanging out the first couple times we held hands and cuddled in the bed of his truck, but it didn’t go any further than that. we’ve had a lot of deep conversations and we have a lot in common and i felt so comfortable around him, we clicked immediately. so i was enjoying my time with him and excited to see where things could potentially go because it usually takes time for me to warm up to someone and feel comfortable and not awkward around them. but with him it felt like it could be different. he started showing signs of attachment issues and clinginess very early on which worried me a bit. after our first hang out, we had a miscommunication over txt message about hanging out for a second time and he thought i didnt want to see him and got upset. i got upset because i was looking forward to seeing him again and got all ready to hang out. i let him know i was upset and he walked to my house in 20° weather to apologize. mind you he only lives like 3 or 4 blocks away and at the time i thought of it as endearing and sweet, but everyone else i told thought it was strange since we had only hung out once. i can now see their point of view given some other things he’s said or scenarios that have happened. he has told me multiple times that he’s worried bc he feels like he’s becoming addicted to me and doesn’t want to lose me and that he is that no one has ever made him feel the way i make him feel. i mean these things are nice to hear, but i feel like it’s a bit of a red flag this early on. 
anyways, after hanging out a couple of times, getting to know each other on a deeper level, holding hands and cuddling there was tension growing. we both mentioned how we wanted to kiss each other so bad but then he said that he wants to take things slow bc he really likes me and doesn’t want to mess things up. he also said he’s never made out with a girl and not had sex with her the same night. to which i replied “we’ll have to change that”. i am not the type of girl to sleep with a guy the same day we have our first kiss. in my last relationship we were together 3 months and made out numerous times and i never slept with him. i just cannot have “meaningless” “fun sex”, i have to feel comfortable enough with a person and trust them to be able to have sex with them (which i told this guy). i was also S/A’d as a child and very sexualized by my last partner, that’s all he wanted me for and never truly cared about me (the guy i was with for 3 months and didn’t sleep with). so this has made it even more hard for me to do sexual things; which i told this current guy this. like i said, he was VERY respectful about it at first which was so nice. fast forward to the 5th time we hung out. we ended up kissing and things got a bit heated. he ended up f!ngering me, which i was fine with in the moment, but he wanted to take it further and have sex.  i said i didn’t want to and he asked why and i was just like “i wanted to take things slow”. we ended up making out again and i kept having to let him know that this wasn’t going to lead to sex. at one point when we stopped kissing, he started breathing all weird and heavy and i asked if he was okay and he said “i am trying to calm myself down because i dont want to lose control”. that got me kind of worried bc i didn’t know what he meant by “lose control”. at that point i was thinking to myself that we need to stop because i dont want this to go any further. during this specific time, we were in the bed of his truck because we liked to stargaze together (i know its winter, but we had sleeping bags, blankets and wore warm clothes) it started to snow so he ended up taking me home and that was the end of that night. 
the next day we hung out again at my house and put on a movie. we were just cuddling at first but about 20 min into the movie he grabbed my chin and signaled that he wanted to kiss. we ended up making out again. i stopped our kiss because i just wanted to watch the movie and i knew if we continued then things would get heated again. he grabbing my chin and so i would kiss him and once again, one thing lead to another and he started f!ngering me again. he was doing it for about 5-10 minutes and again, i was fine with it but in the back of my mind i knew that if i let it continue he would think i was going to have sex with him and i didn’t want to give him a false idea. i scratched his back and once again he said that i needed to stop doing that bc if i didnt he might “lose control”. at that point i got very overwhelmed. i could feel that i was beginning to possibly have a panic attack. i felt like i could not move and my arms were shaking uncontrollably. he cuddled me and comforted me and i was able to calm myself down before i actually had a full on panic attack. after that he started kissing me again and let me just add that i am personally completely fine with kissing, i love kissing, i could do it for hours and still be able to have self control. but i need to remember that is not the same mindset that everyone has which was in the back of my mind the whole time. he ended up trying to f!nger me again but i just did not want that, especially after how my body reacted before. i moved his hand away and he moved it back. then i moved it again and he moved it back again. i moved his hand like 4 times and then he grabbed both my hands and held them down so that i couldn’t move his hand and proceeded to put his finger in me. i was able to get out of his grip and immediately moved his hand and he asked “what are you doing?” to which i replied, “what are YOU doing??” and then he asked why i didn’t want him to continue and i was just like i just don’t want to. he respected that and we stopped and i talked to him (once again) about the reasons why i just cannot have sex with someone this quickly. now i know i didn’t verbally tell him to stop, but i feel like moving his hand more than once should have put my point across. 
what i need an opinion on:
 1. what would this be considered? i would definitely consider this S/A, but i told my mom the whole thing and she says that it is object r^pe. i was confused because he used his finger, not an object. i tried looking it up but i only found mixed answers. if someone can please educate me on that, i would appreciate it. 
2: am i in the wrong for continuing to make out with him and “rile him up”? my mom was saying that if i don’t want him to try and have sex with me or expect it then i shouldn’t be making out with him and letting him do foreplay. (she said this after the first time we kissed, before the S/A happened) however, i told him that i was not going to have sex with him more than once before. i feel like if you know that you can’t control your sexual urges and you know that making out with someone is going to make you “lose control” then maybe you shouldn’t be making out? especially when you know my intentions and also considering how my body reacted before. i don’t know. i also feel like i’ve tried making it out to not be a big deal or that it was also my fault since i was continuing to make out with him and let him f!nger me before. 
i think those are the only questions i have, at least for now. i don’t know if this info is helpful, but i am a 22 y/o F and hes 25 y/o M. as of right now i have told him i think we shouldn’t see each other and he seems to be being respectful of that. it is very unfortunate because i felt so comfortable around him and that i could tell him anything without judgement and i just thought this time it would be different, but it is what it is. thank you so much to anyone who replies and reads all of that. i hope it all makes sense and isn’t too all over the place.

16042,1hzi4vc,post,Repost: I think I was raped when I was 19.,"I posted this on another sub but I feel I should post it here too.

I've never really talked about this outside of self-deprecating jokes. I just know that something happened and it doesn't feel right, but it isn't black and white so I don't know what to think. Using jokes as a coping mechanism isn't working anymore.

When I was 19, my boyfriend at the time broke up with me. It was very sudden and brutal and I was really messed up over it. One of my guy friends at the time heard about it and he invited me along to see a new movie at a movie theater with another one of our friends. Said friend, ""Becky"" was a high school friend of his, and since she and I were best friends, I didn't feel unsafe going along with them. They often saw movies together.

Since the movie theater was in their neighborhood and I lived far away, he invited me over to his home and said we'd drive to the theater together. I was under the impression Becky was coming too. When I got there, Becky wasn't there. I didn't think much of it at first as I assumed she was late. I didn't feel unsafe since I'd been to his home before with other girl friends. 

He offered me alcohol and weed. I said yes, because I'd been coping with the breakup very badly and acting out. I never use any of these substances usually, so this was really out of the norm for me and my body couldn't handle it. The more intoxicated I got, the more confused I got. At one point I asked when Becky was coming, and he said he hadn't invited her over, just me. If I had been sober I would've immediately clocked that, but I was so messed up that I didn't immediately question it. When I asked why, he said ""I didn't think she'd approve of us drinking,"" Looking back, that was such a BS reason.

I finally told him I wasn't feeling well and couldn't keep my eyes open. He suggested going up to his room. I barely managed to do the stairs. I honestly don't know how I did. When we got there, he lit a candle that was on his dresser. I was confused and asked why he did that, and he said he wanted me to see how it looked like when it was lit. If I had been sober, that would have been a major red flag, but I just wanted to sleep. 

I got in bed and he got in with me. I don't really remember the order of things after that, but we had sex. I don't really understand why or how. I never ever ever would have slept with him if I had been sober. I don't feel comfortable saying what happened during it, but he did something that was very painful and I chalked it up to an accident.

I felt really bad afterwards and I blamed myself for being bad at sex. I felt so guilty I let him come over the next day and do it again. I felt so guilty I then dated him for a few weeks because I was too embarrassed to admit that what had happened had made me uncomfortable. I felt so ashamed of myself that when he apologized and told me he felt like he took advantage of me, I comforted him and then promptly deleted the messages. I'm mad at myself for deleting messages that could possibly prove my side of the story if I ever chose to report what happened. ","Repost: I think I was raped when I was 19.

I never ever ever would have slept with him if I had been sober. I don't feel comfortable saying what happened during it, but he did something that was very painful and I chalked it up to an accident.

I felt really bad afterwards and I blamed myself for being bad at sex. I felt so guilty I let him come over the next day and do it again. I felt so guilty I then dated him for a few weeks because I was too embarrassed to admit that what had happened had made me uncomfortable. I felt so ashamed of myself that when he apologized and told me he felt like he took advantage of me, I comforted him and then promptly deleted the messages. I'm mad at myself for deleting messages that could possibly prove my side of the story if I ever chose to report what happened.

16054,1hzixhn,post,I don’t know what to call my experience,"TW FOR MY STORY INCLUDING MYSELF BEING A MINOR

When I was 15 or 16 I was being a dumb kid and messing around internet chat rooms. I went into one that I knew was sexual but I wasn’t thinking about the danger I was putting myself into. A man who was more than twice my age at the time messaged me talking about how the two of us should sext back and forth. I told him I wasn’t comfortable with that because he was so much older than me and I was a minor, but he didn’t take no for an answer and kept insisting it was okay until I said yes. I was smart enough not to share any photos of myself, but I did go along with his request to engage in sexual conversation with him. This started a long ongoing pattern of my teenage self going online to talk to men much older than me in a sexual manner and it has shaped all of my sexual experiences and kinks since then; even now at 23 I still seek out older men online sometimes even though my actions disgust me after the fact. I don’t have words to name what happened to me and I don’t know if I can even fully call it traumatic. When I was around 20 I came out as ftm and I now identify as both gay and asexual, but I’ve never been in a relationship, so I don’t know how I react when irl sex with someone is a possibility in order to fully know if/how my experience affected me. Like I said a bit earlier, I don’t even know what to call this. I don’t know if it counts as grooming or something else. The first interaction was only a one time thing, but it started such a long chain of putting myself back into the same situation with other men.","I don’t know what to call my experience TW FOR MY STORY INCLUDING MYSELF BEING A MINOR

He wanted it everyday, up to six times a day, and would get angry at me for days if I didn’t give in. This went on for five years. He would also beg constantly for stories about my sexual history prior to him, and then punish me for finally telling him by not kissing or showing any affection to me for days. 

Before him, I had a healthy sexual appetite. Since him, I’ve slept with men I had zero interest in out of fear they would attack me. Eight years later, it’s gotten to the point that I’m scared to cuddle my boyfriend of four years in case he wants sex. He’s never shown any aggression but I’m scared he will. I have zero sexual desire. 

I have talked to his current wife and mother of his children about this. I was worried I’d put her in danger by not telling her. She was receptive and kind to me and told me he tried to do the same to her but she told him it was a dealbreaker and he eventually backed off. 

I was happy to learn she was okay and thought I would feel okay from then on. But it’s been a few months now and I’m not okay. If anything I’ve gotten worse. I haven’t had sex with my partner in months now and he’s starting to bring it up.

You did not lead him on, you rejected him when he kissed you. He left and came back, after a few minutes, to take what you didn't want to give while you were asleep. 

You should ask your (now ex) friend how rejecting someone equals leading on. You should ask her how being asleep equals leading on. I would then proceed to tell her that if she were to ever be SA'd that she has better friends than she was to you.

As for the perpetrator and your uni. If you are up for it report him for defamation (to the cops not your uni). However that might mean that you also need to report him for the SA/rape.

*ETA: The absence of no does not mean yes. A lack of resistance does not mean consent. Most victims have a freeze response (don't speak, don't resist) when they are SA'd/raped. Drunk people are even less likely to resist because alcohol (and also drugs) make it hard to process what is happening.*"," I am sorry this happened to you.

You did not lead him on, you rejected him when he kissed you. He left and came back, after a few minutes, to take what you didn't want to give while you were asleep. 

You should ask your (now ex) friend how rejecting someone equals leading on. You should ask her how being asleep equals leading on. I would then proceed to tell her that if she were to ever be SA'd that she has better friends than she was to you.

I'm in a poly relationship and me and my partners had just woken up after sharing a bed and we're talking. I wasn't really talking much bc I was groggy and then partner partner 1 just put there hands down my pants and started fingering me. My other partner  really didn't like us doing sexual stuff so I didn't want to say anything because I didn't want to upset them. When I woke up enough to understand the situation I kinda froze up. I wanted it to stop but I let it go on way too long. so I made a bad joke about it. I was hoping partner 2 would not take it seriously and that partner 1 would realize I wasn't into it and stop. Unfortunately partner 2 did get upset and left. I know that was bad and I should've just said no. I feel guilty for not just saying no. I tried posting in the polyamory subreddit and a mod deleted it and called me gross for letting the partner who got upset be exposed nonconsensually. I feel horrible about it. I didn't consent but I could've stopped it faster and more maturely so partner 2 didn't have see/know about it. 
Also for the record it was early and I was coming off my sleeping meds and was super groggy, I could've encouraged it and not remember. I don't blame them fir that, I don't think they rememberrd I was on meds. So I feel kinda even worse because I don't know if I'm remembering it accurately.

When it got later, a lot of people had gone to bed. We were sat in the kitchen talking and having a general catch up. We were sat with a seat inbetween us and he kept telling me to move closer to him, which I said no to. He eventually said 'fine I'll move there myself' and did so. As he was being so forward and slightly creepy, I decided to call it a night. I was staying over at the party, but he wasn't. He then proceeded to follow me up the stairs and block me from getting to the bedroom. There was a study type room inbetween all the bedrooms, and he kept telling me to go in there with him. I kept saying no, and asking him what for, to which he would just laugh. I said 'no, i don't want to' that many times, that the situation started to give me chills. I tried to get to my room, but he grabbed my waist and wouldn't let me pass. I tried again, and he then proceeded to grab me so forcefully, that i nearly fell backwards down the stairs. I told him I wanted to go, to which he laughed in my face. I told him he was starting to scare me. At one point, he started to physically push me inside the room. I knew no matter what, I could not go in there, as I didn't (or maybe did) know what would happen. He held me so tightly, that I knew I wouldn't stand a chance fighting him. I managed to break from his grip and ran down the stairs, to a room where a lot of the guys were sleeping, to try and wake them up.

Seine Verlobte hatte Geburtstag und er hatte ein nettes Outing mit ihre geplant gehabt.

Einige Wochen später sollte ich einen Patienten zum CT bringen und traf ihn zufällig auch vor dem CT, da er auf einen Patienten wartete. Wir standen alleine im Flur und ich fragte ihn wie die Geburtstagfeier seiner Verlobten letztens war und ob sie sich gefreut hatte, worauf er nicht sonderlich antwortete. Anstatt legte er seine Hand auf meine Schulter und fing an meine Schulter und anschließlich meinen Rücken zu massieren. Mir war das extrem unangenehm und in dem Moment wollte ich einfach nur, dass er aufhört. Ich war wie auf der Stelle erfroren, musterte aber nach einigen Minuten die Mut und erfand schnell eine Story, damit ich bloß von ihm wegkomme. Bin dann schnell ins Bad, da mir kotzübel war und ich dachte, dass ich mich übergeben muss.  
Nach dem Vorfall habe ich darauf geachtet, dass ich ihn nicht alleine auftreffe und habe ihn nachher nur noch einige Male in der Anwesenheit anderer gesehen.

When it was all fresh, all I wanted was for someone to protect me and take me away from that situation. School counsellor was ONLY interested in counselling me if I report it to the police. Maybe they were collecting some records to show? I dont know. No one really helped me and reporting at that time seemed scary! But I swear I will never let this family come near my children (I am still unmarried though). I do have locks, and will move out soon!!!!"," Thank you so [much.You](http://much.You) are so brave!

16106,1hzma9i,post,SA or some weird gray area in between?,"This happened when I was 17, and looking back on it as an adult I’m still really not sure how to feel about it. I stupidly got very friendly with a 60 yr old regular at my job, we exchanged numbers, and he would pay me for nudes and whatnot. Never told him my age but he came in on one of my off days and I was doing homework in my high school uniform so safe to say he at least knew I was a teenager. He asked me to give him a blowjob for a few hundred bucks, and I pretty eagerly agreed because that was a helluva lot of money for me. So I get there, we smoke some weed, and then he handcuffs me and has me give him a bj, and he’s saying all this weird shit like “If you don’t make me cum like this I’ll r*pe your ass”, “Is this what you do to your daddy at home” and had opened the blinds at some point and made me look out and said that people were gonna see me like that, he had stripped me and was touching me in a few ways I had told him I didn’t really want.. just stuff that was rubbing me the wrong way. And then when he finished he locked his legs around my head and from what I remember I was trying to push pretty damn hard because I was definitely choking at that point. And then that was that, I got paid, and I went to a friend’s house and I don’t remember much after that but when she tells me about that night she always gets extremely emotional because apparently I was “desolate” and I couldn’t focus on anything, and then I proceeded to sleep for like 18 hours straight. And, like, some of that I definitely agree was fucked up. But even then I knew that I was taking a risk and I knew he was some creepy old guy and that I should’ve expected something bad to happen. My friend is extremely insistent on the fact that I was assaulted but I just really can’t bring myself to agree with it when I drove there, agreed to it, and got paid for it.

16110,1hzmeww,post,Telling my new boyfriend about my SA,"Hello everyone! I’m in need of some advice and I don’t feel like I can discuss this with my friends, so that’s why I’m here. I (21) got SA when I was 18. Shortly after, I got into a relationship with my now ex-boyfriend. (He didn’t SA me) The relationship was very toxic, but he did always support me in my recovery and acceptance journey. Back then, I had a lot of panic attacks and I started crying during sex. Now I am in a new relationship. He is the most wonderful person I could ever dream of being with and I feel like this is the one. However, I am in doubt about telling him about my SA. I like that I feel normal with him, as in not being seen as that person who got SA. On the other hand, I feel like he should know about this important part of my life. 

So my question really is.. Did you ever tell your new partner about it and how did it go? And if you decided that you didn’t feel like talking about it, are you still happy with your choice?

Sorry if my English isn’t correct. It’s not my native language. Lots of love to you all. ","Telling my new boyfriend about my SA Hello everyone!

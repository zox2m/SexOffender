17470,m7r0cxq,comment,,"I wouldn't say this was grooming, she was way too young and from what you're describing it sounds like she was a victim. No one should be having sex at such an age, they can't consent. Children who are being sexually abused tend to talk a lot about sex because it's obviously a topic that troubles them. Did she make any inappropriate advances towards you? 

In any case, you being exposed to such content so early was definitely not healthy. I'm sorry that her pressuring you lead to that, such an experience can definitely affect a person deeply. Regardless of her intentions your feelings are valid. A child's brain can't process watching material like this, it can be scary and shocking."," I wouldn't say this was grooming, she was way too young and from what you're describing it sounds like she was a victim.

I also struggle with guilt/self blame because I was abused by both of my exes and both times it took me a long time to realise it.

17477,1i3zm24,post,do things ever get better?,"i was SA’ed in august 2024 by someone i was dating at the time. i promptly ended the relationship and instructed him not to contact me again, but he has continued to reach out to me ever since. i never responded until his most recent attempt to contact me about a week ago. i was sick of remaining silent while he was free to drop in at any moment and remind me of the trauma. i called him out for everything he did to me and told him that if he contacted me again, i would go to the police… and he still texted me 30 minutes later. so, i went to the police the next morning. i only wanted to report the harassment, but i had mentioned the past SA and the cops strongly urged me to give a statement, so i did. i was issued a domestic violence TRO in advance of an FRO hearing, which was then rescheduled to 4 days sooner than initially planned. i was only notified of the change the day before and felt completely unprepared.

the hearing was this morning, and it was horrendous. as i was trying to explain why this individual made me feel unsafe, the judge kept interrupting me and saying he was “confused”. i answered his questions to the best of my ability (or at least i thought i did), but he kept getting more and more agitated. whenever i mentioned the SA, he told me it was “irrelevant” and he didn’t want to hear about it, even though it’s literally written in my restraining order. he told me i needed to start with the most recent contact and move backwards, so i did, describing how my abuser had contacted me a week prior. he quickly cut me off again, saying that “two text messages isn’t nearly enough to come to court”. i reiterated that it was this person’s repeated attempts to contact me ALONGSIDE the fact that he sexually assaulted me (in my apartment, so he knows where i live and can theoretically show up at any moment… and is known to carry a knife on him). but once again, the judge told me those were irrelevant details. he only wanted to know about the “precipitating event”, aka the contact last week, which he had already deemed was insufficient. so why was i even here?

i began sobbing because i felt trapped and confused. it seemed like nothing i could say would be listened to. i stood up to leave the courtroom, but the guards wouldn’t let me out and told me to “calm down and sit down”. everyone looked at me like it was ME who was the dangerous one, like i was shameful, like i was a nuisance. the judge then proceeded to scold me for “lashing out” and acted like he was doing me a favor by giving me another ten days to seek counsel… which, by the way, he had denied me only minutes earlier. i was under the assumption that a DV advocate would be present to help me, but no one showed up. the first thing i did when i walked in the courtroom was ask for the counsel of my advocate, but the court clerk said it was “my job” to have spoken to someone in advance, and told me to sit down.

i think the worst part wasn’t being forced to revisit my trauma, wasn’t being silenced and invalidated by everyone in the room, but was how my abuser sat six feet away from me the entire time. he was quiet and calm, answering all the questions perfectly in the judge’s eyes. in return, the judge did him the courtesy of allowing him to finish every sentence, always making sure to address him as “sir”. my abuser was given a front-row seat to watch my total breakdown, all while he just sat there like the perfect golden boy. surely he looked like the epitome of respect. in contrast, my words and actions only affirmed my abuser’s (and likely the judge’s) perspective that i am unhinged, unworthy of being listened to, just another aggressive “woman scorned” spouting nonsense.

i feel like the walls are caving in on me. i feel like i took a wrong turn at some point along the way and now i’m too lost to find my way back. i don’t recognize my life and i don’t recognize myself. i used to think i had a purpose on this earth, but that illusion has been shattered.

17484,1i40af9,post,Sharing my story almost 14 years later.,"Im currently a 27M and I was sexually assaulted when I was 14 by a guy who was in his 30s.

I was in the 9th grade and I started smoking weed and I didn't have many friends expect who I would smoke up with, I was one the least popular kid. I remember I was at the mall after school and this guy came up to me and started talking to me, he looked like he was in his 30s and honestly I felt good he started talking to me cause I always never had anyone approach me. We talked and he told me he had some weed(back then weed was illegal) and I didn't pass up the chance.

We went somewhere where there was less people so no one would call the cops on us. I started smoking up with him but I felt different this time, I started to realize that this weed had to laced. I don't remember what he did to me but I remember he groped me sexually. I remember going home and I was scared and I didn't know what to do. I couldn't tell my parents cause yes they would call the cops but they would get mad at me for smoking weed with a stranger and till this day they don't know.

Honestly the saddest part for me was that my friends never believed me that I was SA'ed. I tried to bring up in a jokingly way but no body ever believed me and they thought I was too ugly for someone to touch me. In addition but being gay was still frowned upon but was becoming more accepted but that made it harder for people to believe me.

I'm glad today I can share my story. This incident did ruin my life, I got depression, was sucidial so many times , and I just kept for 14 years with no one hearing my story . 

However I am getting intense therapy and I've got a great job and even finishing my masters. I want to take this incident and I want it to make me stronger and I want others to come forward and share there stories.

I want to say this before someone tells me this. I DO NOT defend what he did to me, or believe he was not on the wrong. I do not condone this 

I'm so bloody fucking stupid. I have never been a good girl, even since I was very young I've been rebellious with my parents, they are strict and religious. I'm sure they wouldn't approve of the things I do and don't tell, but I do them either way. Haven't I been like that, haven't I done those things? I wouldn't have been raped, and I know it's true.

I know I shouldn't, but I smoke and drink, and have done drugs before. I have a fake ID to buy the alcohol, I look older than I am and IDs are hard to fake easily where I live, so no one had suspected. A girlfriend helps me get the drugs. 

The day we started talking I thought he had saved my life, he lied for me so I wouldn't get caught. We started talking while we smoked together or I chugged one or two beers. He said so many things I should've at least suspected he was a paedophile, but I never did. I ignored all the signs and pushed it all away. He offered to give me a ride home one day, everything in my head screamed at me, it was not a good idea. My parents were in my head, remembering how they told me not to do those things for my own safety. I told myself that they knew nothing about this... I got inside his car, the bastard started touching, me there, just the thighs, but god was that enough to make me super uncomfortable. I told him so, and he stopped, he said he didn't mean it that way, and I idiotically believed him. 

Even when he said he had to pick up some things from his ex-wife's place, I agreed to go with him. Even when his ex-wife was not at her place, I didn't say anything and put it aside.  
  
I let him rape me. 

I fucking hate myself, I know he is in the wrong, and he should rot in hell, but I enabled him to do this in all ways possible. Hadn't I done any of those things, he wouldn't have been able to rape me. But I let it happen.

He spat on me when he fingered me even tho I was really wet already (Which I even feel more of a bloody arsehole for.), he spat... he called me a brat. He said I was such a cutie...

17492,1i40olt,post,Suppressed memories surfacing again and it’s worse than I thought,"I’m 22 I had DID which means a lot of suppressed memories. Three years ago I reported my grandpa SAing me. I didn’t have all the memories which my parents didn’t understand and they urged me to report. I went through the interviews/talks with the police but the case never got picked up.

Three years later and I get memories (today) of my childhood favorite priest the man we looked up to and wanted to be like (I used to wish I could be a priest but I wasn’t born a boy) a little had the memory, she’s 8 and loves God, she’s build/drawn churches etc in different things, she’s talked about God with our therapist 

I’m going to describe the memory here 

We remember lying on some sorta table in some back room while he took out his thing and him telling us it’s what God wanted

We literally prayed for this man to come back to the church when he left in 2011 or 2012

He had a picture with us after our first communion 

I loved him as a person.

To cope we order our favorite food, let the little watch her favorite movie and we wrote some of a song but it became too much

I don’t feel emotionally safe.
I want to hug my mom and cry but that’s in a fantasy we aren’t like that and she doesn’t believe in DID, what am I supposed to do? Say so yk the DID you think I’m making up, well my favorite priest SA’d me and I only have one vague memory of it

Idk I don’t know how to feel better
And will anything even come from reporting this man? He’s a priest still probably somewhere. Two of the many people who assaulted me I loved in a way.

17494,1i40oou,post,Unsure of childhood abuse,"I recognize that this is so minor compared to some serious stories but I’m scared I have a real problem.

Growing up my brother would constantly grab my ass and it would sometimes slide to my crotch when I moved but “as a joke”. Also to mention I was always clothed. My mom would never say anything and would laugh along with it too sometimes bc I would get super defensive and sometimes cry. My mom would also grab my chest and private areas constantly and I always felt violated by it but they never listened to how upset it would make me. 

(Random note I thought this was part of Hispanic culture growing up because I had nothing else to compare it to as all of the other families around me were white… not sure if any other poc relate to this).

I’m 28F and conventionally attractive but I haven’t even been able to kiss another person. Everytime someone tries to touch me if I feel they have an intent for more I absolutely panic and shut down. It can ruin my functionality for days and I keep getting intrusive thoughts revisiting that moment even if nothing crazy happened.  

Again I’m so sorry to all of those who have experienced intense sexual trauma I genuinely think this is the strongest group of people out there. I feel bad even bringing this up bc my experience is so minimal compared to others but I’d appreciate any insight.

17502,1i41jno,post,Was I Sexually Assaulted by Accident? ,"To give you guys some history, when I (M19) was young, I was taken advantage multiple times by a family member. Ever since then, I don't think it necessarily destroyed my childhood growing up, but it's memories I never forgot, and never knew what to do with them, so I just never talked about it besides my partner (F18). 

Our sexual relationship was...definitely a work-in-progress haha, but it was a great journey to go on with them, for the past 2 1/2 years. Lots of ups and downs, and learning each other's boundaries and pleasures. 

Unfortunately, today was one of those days that sort of blurred the line a little, and I genuinely need a second opinion on the kind of mindset I should have. 

Today, we had sex, and one thing about my partner is that they really want to get better at riding. They're very enthusiastic about it, and is always looking forward to performing better and better over time. 

They decided to be on top and do their thing. It was really good. A little too good, honestly. We take birth control, but I knew I didn't want to finish inside. 

The pleasure was overstimulating, and I was being a bit noisy. (We had company in the home). She covered my mouth to muffle the noise, but before she did that, I told her to slow it down, since I was getting really close to finishing. 

She denied the request, and kept going on. I suppose In her head, it was an act of being dominant by denying me, perhaps. The sensation was paralyzing, and a little overwhelming. 

I ended up finishing inside, and that's when things went downhill from here. 

She got off feeling very proud of herself and confident by the performance, but I remember vividly just laying there feeling... disgusted and disappointed in myself. 

I've never felt more less of a man and stripped of my control in...a while and I suppose a bit of my dignity was damaged, too

I felt helpless in the moment, and she noticed my discomfort immediately. She asked me what was wrong, and we talked about it. 

She convinced herself that she raped me, and I was trying to rationalize the situation and was denying that I was sexually assaulted. She was crying profusely because from her perspective, she violated and raped me.

I didn't know what to think or how to process the emotions I went through in the moment, but I could'nt accept jotting it down to ""I was raped"". 

To me, It simply was a really bad case of miscommunication. 

She thought we should break up because she wronged me in such an egregious way, but I assured her that I didn't want to end things, and that we will be ok. 

What do you guys think? Was I sexually assaulted, and this is this an end all be all type of situation?

17507,1i41w3e,post,its been years and i still don’t know what it was,"CW: i am not a minor, but i was 16 when this happened. 

I had a boyfriend when I was 16 and we were about as in love as 16 year olds can be. We dated for a while and everything was going so well until we decided to start having sex. We had talked before about whether we were ready and how we’d proceed when we were, but of course it didn’t pan out the way we planned.

The first time we slept together, he offered to perform oral sex on me. I was hesitant and had said no previously, but he encouraged me and told me he’d stop if I changed my mind, so I said yes. I was so nervous and tense, but I thought that was just because I’d never had sex before. I told him before we started that I didn’t want him to penetrate me in any way, and he said he wouldn’t. A few minutes in to giving me oral, I felt him put his fingers inside me. It was uncomfortable and I immediately freaked out and told him to stop. He did, asked me if I was okay, and I said I was fine and just didn’t want fingers in me. He said that was okay and went back to giving me oral. Throughout the rest of our relationship, this happened multiple times. He would always stop when I told him to, he just never asked if it was okay to finger me in the first place. At one point I asked him to finger me because I figured I could learn to like it for him, but it was very painful and we had to stop. We only dated for a few months after the first incident. I didn’t date anyone for a long time after that. 

Was I assaulted? I’m turning 24 soon and I still debate over whether something bad happened to me or if I’m just being dramatic. Some people very close to me have been assaulted and what happened to me doesn’t come close to what they went through. I just keep telling myself it could have been worse.

A few minutes in to giving me oral, I felt him put his fingers inside me. It was uncomfortable and I immediately freaked out and told him to stop. He did, asked me if I was okay, and I said I was fine and just didn’t want fingers in me. He said that was okay and went back to giving me oral. Throughout the rest of our relationship, this happened multiple times. He would always stop when I told him to, he just never asked if it was okay to finger me in the first place. At one point I asked him to finger me because I figured I could learn to like it for him, but it was very painful and we had to stop. We only dated for a few months after the first incident. I didn’t date anyone for a long time after that. 

Was I assaulted? I’m turning 24 soon and I still debate over whether something bad happened to me or if I’m just being dramatic. Some people very close to me have been assaulted and what happened to me doesn’t come close to what they went through. I just keep telling myself it could have been worse.

17526,1i43mpo,post,12 years later and I still don't know what to call it.,"(throw away, strictly because I dont want this on my main)

I wanna emphasize I didn't know what consent was or what it entailed when it first started.   
It kind of began around winter 2012 when I was 8. I invited my friend to sleepover for the night. I trusted her deeply and she was like a cool older sister to me back then. During our sleepover, she suggested we act out one of those stupid animal roleplays all the weird kids would do on the playground, except nude and alone in my room. Things escalated from there, but there wasn't any explicit body-to-body contact, aside from humping I guess? It was 12 years ago my memory is hazy. After that, I told my dad about a month later what happened and he shamed me and told me it was just ""girls experimenting.""   
His dismissal of what happened when I knew something wasn't right didn't sit well with me but my parents still let me hang out with her and sleep over at her house. 

It started up again around the time puberty was setting in during middle school (10-12), where it devolved into full on lesbian sex. I still didn't have a full grasp on what consent was, but we never expressed consent in any way, shape, or form. I'd just come over after school and we'd get to it like it was as normal as breathing air. At that point I was never taught what the word was, aside from ""no means no"" but I never said no because she was my friend and I figured she knew what was right for me. It only stopped when my period started. Never when hers started. When my first period happened she lost all interest in me sexually. It kind of broke me at the time because I thought what we had was something good and fine. I finally really broke things off with her before I moved and she started self harming in front of me. Not because she was upset that I was moving. Probably for some other reason I'd forgotten.

The whole experience led me to become hypersexual, and I still deeply struggle with hypersexuality to this day because of her and what she did to me over those years. I don't really see the experience as a negative OR a positive, just a thing that happened to me. I've tried to tell my mother once during a mental breakdown that what my friend did to me deeply ruined me, but she brushed it off (I was... 19? when I told her this? She knew already but I reckon she forgot.)   
To this day I have NO idea what to even classify this as... rape sounds harsh but I genuinely cannot think of what else it could be.","12 years later and I still don't know what to call it. (throw away, strictly because I dont want this on my main)

17533,1i44neq,post,My brother SA’ed my Girlfriend.,"I’ve been living with this for a week and have no one to talk to. A few weeks ago my brother was over at my place with his family. We all drank and hung out until about 3am when I passed out. Before I fell asleep it was just the 3 of us left awake. 

Just a few days ago my girlfriend told me everything that happened. I was furious at my brother(rightfully so) and called him to tell him how much his actions destroyed her and myself. My girlfriend and I talked through it. She’s been SA’ed before so she tends to freeze up and not move when someone starts touching her. She can’t say no but doesn’t say yes, she freezes.

Now, tonight my brother came to talk to me and it was a rough conversation about his drug addiction and his suicidal thoughts. I didn’t really show him any emotion, I’m still furious at him but I let him speak his truth. During that time he let me know that part of the confusion is that he started touching her, realized he was in the wrong and pulled away, but, she pulled him back in.

Now, I understand freezing up. Fight or flight and all that. But this really got to me. I confronted her about it and she admitted it. She told me that due to being in the position before she subconsciously moves into the routine. At this point though I can’t help but feel betrayed by both of them. I feel destroyed.

I didnt really know where else to go for help so if you guys could help me understand this pls do.

So, im a F 19, when i was a young young kid (ages like 3/4-6 i think this was happening), i used to hang out a lot with a cousin of mine that was a year older than me. (she was also a girl) we used to hang out at each others houses a lot when we were little, AGAIN UR LAST TW, she always told me to play ""doctor""
(she was the doctor😭) and i was the patient, and for SOME reason i ALWAYS HAD TO BE PANTLESS W MU LEGS OPEN, and she used to, well do things to me down there. I didnt really say no??? i think when i was a kid i kinda wanted to do that maybe bc idfk hormones?? some kids have hormones its normal but idk this was weird. On the other hand i think i was a tiny bit uncomfortable but im not sure was long ago. Adults didnt know i think, her mom caught us one time but she just told us not to do that and thats it. I think i had told my mom at some point and she told me to ""tell her no"" (im unsure bc i was VERY young and my memory is a bit foggy) and yeah the last time it was about to happen there was one more cousin of mine with us and i just said ""no do this to him""(and i gave them a teddy bear) my cousin argued ""it isnt the same"" but i insisted on no and it didnt happen, and i believe she never asked me to do it again after this. But when it was happening it used to happen every time we hang out pretty much if i remember correctly. 

Growing up I had mentioned it to both my mom and my grandma again but i dont really remember their reactions, maybe they didnt really believe me?

Generally i dont really think about this a lot but it sometimes comes up in my mind and i feel weird. And lately it starts to pop up more and more i dont know why, maybe because in my sexual life nowdays I prefer being the dominant and doing all the work, my partner happens to be a pillow princess so im lucky i guess, on one hand i feel bad she doesnt really touch me like that but on the other hand i dont wanna tell her to bc im scared and kinda uncomfortable idk why. (we have been together since 15 and having sex since 17, we are both 19 now) And i was thinking lately, has that thing with my cousin affected me in my sex life now? is that why i feel rpetty uncomfortable being touched sexually? i prefer getting someone else off than getting off myself when im having sex, while when alone i like masturbating.

17560,1i49xhf,post,I’m not sure if it was rape,"This happened around a year ago, I’m so tired of questioning myself every single day and I would hate to be victimising myself if it wasn’t real/true. Please someone respond to this

For context: Around a year ago I was going to Hillsong church. My ex was friends with a girl (I’ll call give fake names) Jane she was dating Tim. We hung out as a group before and then they broke up and Tim became a church leader. There are rules between leader and student I was a student at the time. I think he was 19 and I was 17.

My ex was really manipulative so I decided to tell him that I wanted to take a break in our relationship. I told Tim what happened and we decided to drink together which I was involved in planning. I texted Jane on instagram asking if it was okay and that if she didn’t want me to go I wouldn’t go. After church he told me to sneak out and I got in his car. He drove to the liquor store and he helped me buy alcohol. I said I wanted two sojus, he ended up getting three because he said there was a discount. We got food and then he said he’ll drive us to a spot. He said he couldn’t drink because he was driving he took one sip the whole night. He gave me his jacket because it was cold and we were just chatting. I drank a bunch of alcohol and eventually I got to the point where I was really really drunk. I couldn’t walk properly so he carried me to the car. In the car I can’t even remember if he kissed me first or I did. And eventually we had sex. I was on top of him. How can you rape someone if they’re on top? 

My ex appeared out of no where with his flashlight on and recorded everything shouting at us and that made me sober up more. Tim ended up driving me to my friends house and I ended up in the hospital the next day. I saw a sexual assault counsellor who told me the drinks I had was equivalent to a bottle of wine. She told me it was rape but it never felt like it to me. I did too much, I initiated so much. The worse part was that the most traumatic part was my ex doing that. I forgave him after that and we started dating again, the whole church found out Tim stopped going and everyone stopped talking to me. I ended up getting like a restraining order on him. I don’t know if this is rape and it kills me if it isn’t because that means I ruined someone’s life. I forgot to mention Tim’s ex girlfriend Jane did end up telling me he raped her in a car while she said no. 

I think the part I’m most ashamed of is that I was on top. Please comment on this post, thanks.

17595,1i4e8kg,post,Was this assault? What do I do now??,"So for some backstory, I’m a 21 F and my partner is 23 M. I have severe PTSD and dissociative issues that showed up after an entire childhood of significant trauma. Most of the trauma that I experienced was a form of sexual violence. For my teen years, I developed a response of hypersexuality. Once I started getting into long term relationships, this hypersexuality would last until I felt safe with them and then all of a sudden, my sex drive was completely gone. This is what happened in my most recent relationship. With my current partner, things were great until six months in when my brain got too comfortable and I no longer wanted sex. 

We went from having sex multiple times a day to once or twice a week. For my partner, this was a difficult switch. He is hypersexual almost to a clinical degree. While he didn’t directly push for me to have sex when I didn’t want to, it was still clear how much he craved it so I started making myself do it- a slippery path, I know. This is when things started to get bad. I started to repulse sex but my pattern recognition picked up on the fact that it would indirectly cause issues if I went too long without doing things with him. I think this is because it genuinely regulates his brain so the sudden decrease was dysregulating. 

I have a very strong freeze and fawn response from my trauma and he knows this. Last night, we were cuddling and his hands started to wander. My brain started thinking “he’s trying to initiate. Just let it happen” as I start to dissociate. He notices that I’m in a partially dissociated state and starts saying things like “I can’t touch you right now. You’re not fully there” but then his hands kept wandering. He kept saying he couldn’t or shouldn’t but the next thing I knew, he was slipping a finger in me. I froze. My brain is in a loop telling me to stay still and let it happen. I don’t make a sound. He keeps fingering me and asked once or twice if it was okay and I didn’t say anything. He keeps asking while he’s touching me and I might’ve mumbled that it was okay. I can’t fully remember the rest but basically this went on for a bit and he penetrated me a few times before giving up. 

Afterwards, he went to go play games and I was sitting there shaking. I felt sick. I still feel sick. I don’t understand. I don’t know why he thought that was okay. He knows how traumatized I am and yet he penetrated me without asking, without any indication that I was enjoying myself. He would NEVER touch me like that if he knew it was actively distressing me which is why I’m so confused. I know my fawn and freeze response makes me hard to read but isn’t consent supposed to be enthusiastic? What was so confusing about this situation? I don’t get it. I don’t understand. 

I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to process this. He is my person. Our lives are entangled. Our friends. Our finances. Our future. I can’t comprehend that this happened. I just want to push it down so deep and move on like it never happened. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know what to do. ","Was this assault? What do I do now??

17617,1i4fflj,post,Was I groomed?,"When I was in college (19F) I got involved with one of my teachers (51M). College started off good he would act like a cool uncle to me, and I thought it was cool bc I never had a great father figure in my life. One day he overheard me saying to my friends I wanna get a boob job in the future and later on when no one else could hear he said he could hook me up. And I was confused bc I didn't know if he just meant ask a favor of one of his dr friends or what he meant. It felt weird to me but at the time I was naive and kind of liked any attention. I would ask him why he wanted to do that for me and he would never give me an answer just say I don't need to worry about it. A few weeks later I asked him if he would help me work on something that a Dr had critiqued me on at clinicals. So after class we went to the lab and he helped me. A little bit after we started he kind of had sexual things he would say or talk about. I don't remember the details exactly. I do remember him saying he uses his tongue to please women. It made me uncomfortable I didn't know exactly how to respond. We got out to the parking lot and he basically told me he enjoys spending time with me and would like to buy me a few gifts each month and I was very shocked like that's when I for sure knew things would never be the same again. Again I didn’t really know what to say he told me to think about it. So I got in the car and left. I felt so weird in the car. I felt stressed I didn’t know what to do. I remember either that evening or the next he texted me and said something like sorry if I scared you off. And I remember I would reply to him. Idk what I said. But I wasn’t immediately denying him like I should have. I was naive and stupid. A few weeks past and he would still text me and I would text him back. It all unraveled into a sexual relationship. It started with him asking for pics. And then he would get a hotel for us sometimes. I had never had sex before or a boyfriend and he knew that. He took my virginity. And basically for a year we would get together at a hotel he would give me edibles sometimes and when that would happen I would end up freaking out and crying sometimes while we were together. A couple months after this I knew I wanted to break up with him bc he wouldn’t even text me much. Or any time I just wanted to cuddle he just couldn’t.  he would always put his hands in my pants. And if I got upset I could tell he would get mad so I would just do it sometimes. One time I didn’t wanna do something he got really mad and it made me upset and go into a different room to cry and he came in there threw my bra at me and left the room. Anytime i told him I wasn’t happy and wanted to end it he would always say he has no reason to live and was going to put a bullet in his head. So I stayed with him longer than I wanted. A week after I graduated I broke up with him. Now that I’m older I realize how stupid I was and I’m just struggling trying to understand everything. I feel very guilty bc I feel responsible for what happened on my part. I feel nasty when I think about him or that time in my life. If you guys have any advice or opinions that could help me I’d really appreciate it on how to cope and heal.","Was I groomed? When I was in college (19F) I got involved with one of my teachers (51M).

And if I got upset I could tell he would get mad so I would just do it sometimes. One time I didn’t wanna do something he got really mad and it made me upset and go into a different room to cry and he came in there threw my bra at me and left the room. Anytime i told him I wasn’t happy and wanted to end it he would always say he has no reason to live and was going to put a bullet in his head. So I stayed with him longer than I wanted. A week after I graduated I broke up with him. Now that I’m older I realize how stupid I was and I’m just struggling trying to understand everything. I feel very guilty bc I feel responsible for what happened on my part. I feel nasty when I think about him or that time in my life. If you guys have any advice or opinions that could help me I’d really appreciate it on how to cope and heal.",3,1.0,2025-01-18 19:36,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1i4fflj/was_i_groomed/,Neutral

1. ask a friend or family member to stop by and live with you for a while. im not sure what your situation is, such as you living in an apartment or still in your old house, but telling someone you struggle witb SH can be a big step forward. sit down and send a text or have a talk. ask them for help getting out of bed, eatung normally, keeping up a routine, and make them take away all sharp objects that you can purposefully find a way to hurt yourself with.

2. if you ever feel the urge, get off your phone and find something to do with your hands. do a workout, cook, ask to hangout with friends, go on a walk, find a fidget... something to keep yourself busy and not try to actively search for a harmful escape.

3. have regular activities. i know it can be so difficult to get out of bed, to brush your teeth, to talk to someone- but if you can just put your feet on the floor, you can do anything. try to find a local club in your area. see if your library offers little book talks or if there's a new hobby you want to try. see if you and your friends can have more frequent hangouts.

I’m a 22F who was sexually assaulted and I’m also a student at the academy of fine arts. I’m trying to heal through my art so the theme of my thesis is sexual assault. I have this idea for a project that will be a video, kind of like a documentary with all different kind of personal stories.

If you want, you can comment here your story or dm me. I’d prefer if you could add to what happened the age, gender, ethnicity, social class, culture of both you and the assaulter, the country you live in (and where it happens if it was abroad) and if you work in “high risk” jobs (like prostitution). Did you report to the police? Did you tell someone? Did you understand what happened to you at that moment or did you realise it afterwards?

I’m trying to show that even if we all had the same experience, with differente circumstances, society  treats the victims differently based on the factors I ask to add to the story.

17653,1i4j3qh,post,I was sexually assaulted last semester by my ex boyfriend when we were dating,"I was 16 back in 2024 and this year I turn 17, my ex boyfriend was 17 and he will soon turn 18 in September. And I am mainly making this for advice and other things. I will describe what happened for each instance since it happened 4 different times during lunch at school 

(His fake name will be Lyle)

(1). I remember we met up in the lobby near the cafeteria and we went outside to hangout, we have a staircase near the basketball court outside that leads to an remote area, Lyle took me up there and I was told to be laid down after I did. I was making an uncomfortable face and I didn’t want to and he put his hand down my pants and started assaulting me before he quickly pulled out his hand when the security guard came up the stairs and told us to leave the area.

(2). This happened in a building on a Friday when our RC car club was cancelled when the teacher wasn’t there. His friend was there (his fake name will be Tyler for his friend) and Lyle was there and I was there, I was play fighting with Lyle when I was in his lap and Tyler was recording but afterwards when that stopped, Tyler wasn’t recording anymore but Lyle decided to put his hand up my shirt under my bra in front of Tyler and I did tell Lyle I wasn’t comfortable with that and Lyle didn’t care and still kept his hand there before eventually lunch ended

(3). We were on the staircase at the top and even though I was uncomfortable and I expressed that Lyle still pulled out his penis meanwhile the staircase was outside and everyone from a different perspective would be able to see, Lyle had me sit between his legs and held me close and he for some reason told me about how he is depressed and how his dad has brain tumors before eventually putting his hand under my shirt and bra despite me saying I wasn’t okay with it, he still did it

(4). We were laying on the grass area under the tree outside near the gym and we were out in the open and other people were in that area, he put his hands on my hips under my pants and underwear and it’s obvious that if people looked they could see, I told him I wasn’t okay with it and he still did it

I live in New Mexico and I also wonder how long does it usually take for these things to be investigated since there is camera footage and I did write full detailed statements and I did speak and report it back in December, there is multiple reasons why I wrote this blog though.","I was sexually assaulted last semester by my ex boyfriend when we were dating I was 16 back in 2024 and this year I turn 17, my ex boyfriend was 17 and he will soon turn 18 in September. And I am mainly making this for advice and other things. I will describe what happened for each instance since it happened 4 different times during lunch at school 

(His fake name will be Lyle)

(1). I remember we met up in the lobby near the cafeteria and we went outside to hangout, we have a staircase near the basketball court outside that leads to an remote area, Lyle took me up there and I was told to be laid down after I did. I was making an uncomfortable face and I didn’t want to and he put his hand down my pants and started assaulting me before he quickly pulled out his hand when the security guard came up the stairs and told us to leave the area.

(2). This happened in a building on a Friday when our RC car club was cancelled when the teacher wasn’t there. His friend was there (his fake name will be Tyler for his friend) and Lyle was there and I was there, I was play fighting with Lyle when I was in his lap and Tyler was recording but afterwards when that stopped, Tyler wasn’t recording anymore but Lyle decided to put his hand up my shirt under my bra in front of Tyler and I did tell Lyle I wasn’t comfortable with that and Lyle didn’t care and still kept his hand there before eventually lunch ended

(3). We were on the staircase at the top and even though I was uncomfortable and I expressed that Lyle still pulled out his penis meanwhile the staircase was outside and everyone from a different perspective would be able to see, Lyle had me sit between his legs and held me close and he for some reason told me about how he is depressed and how his dad has brain tumors before eventually putting his hand under my shirt and bra despite me saying I wasn’t okay with it, he still did it

(4). We were laying on the grass area under the tree outside near the gym and we were out in the open and other people were in that area, he put his hands on my hips under my pants and underwear and it’s obvious that if people looked they could see, I told him I wasn’t okay with it and he still did it

17654,1i4j7i9,post,I think my cousin SAed me,"This is a repost i just felt that i left alot of things ((I don't know if this is an assault or not. But lately when i started remembering about it, it made me feel weird. 

We are cousins but we used to be very very close. They are only a year older than me so i felt very close to them. We always had a weird relationship but not something like that. 

It started by some weird comments here and there but it evolved in to them sending me some porn videos. I didn't feel comfortable with them and i would always brush them off when they suggest me watching porn. They were sending me stuff like this for years but i always made execes. 

They would always force me to do some dances with them. Alot of them were harmless. Then, they started presenting more ""adult"" dances. They started forcing me to twerk and stuff like this. I never really liked it and always told them that i don't want to and that i don't know. I enjoyed dancing with them when the dances were more innocent.

After that they started touching me, my, chest, my bottom, thigh and lips as a joke. I hate touching so i would always just yell at them to stop or just move away. 

One day At a sleep over at their house, we were sleeping on the ground together. They were stearing my way but i brushed it off to sleep. I woke up in the middle of the night on them hugging me from behind and touching my body. I didn't make a sound because i was disgusted and i didn't want them to get sad at me. I just fell back asleep. 

Then they started making comment like ""i would fuck you"" or ""i would rape you and make you cry"" and stuff like this

I didn't really think much of it and just laughed it off

But one time at my house we were laying on the ground watching some cartoons. I was (13~) they were (15~). They told me that they will give me a massage. I didn't really want to but i didn't want them to get sad and cut themselves so i just said okay. They sat on my thighs as i laied on my stomach. They started massaging me but it felt like just touching me and not a massage. After a while I told them to stop but they insisted. They even Force me watch a porn video as they massage me instead of the cartoon. 

So, i was there laying on my stomach, they are basically rubbing themselves on my ass and touching my back and chest. They even released on me because i felt the wetness from their pants. I didn't feel good After words and u slowly started pulling away from them. They started regaining me by threatening to cut themselves again and blaming me for not giving them attention. 

Now I completely stop talking to them

I don't know if that's an assault. I don’t feel like it is but still weirds me out. I didn't say no most of the time. I just made excuses. I feel like it's my fault for not saying no. And then again we both were kids and horny a little so i feel like i entertained those actions too. 

Thank you for listening and i hope everyone is don't alright here 🌹)) 

That was the post i posted before but i think i need to mention a few things that i didn't say last time. 

Those weren't the only times something like this happened.

When we were pretty young like 7-8 years old they took some pictures of me naked. It wasn't just them it was them, their older siblings (who is 7 years older than me) and their young sibling (who is my age). 

They used to blackmail me with it, saying if i don't do that they will do this and that. 

By that age i wasn't really able to speak. I'm autistic and didn't speak until i was pretty old. When i tried telling my parents they got real angry with me and beated me up and when my cousins knew that i told my parents the beated me up too. 

I didn't tell my parents because i was scared for them.

My cousins continued that and everytime we get alone they started forcing me to strip. And sometimes use stick or needles on me. I even started thinking that this is okay and continued playing with them. 

I don't know if any of this would consider SA because i didn't stop them and tell them a straight ""NO"". I think it was mostly my fault because all they remember from it is that it was just games. 

Someone told me that my cousin was just attracted to me and didn't know how to express it. And all of this is just kids being horny. 

I mean i get that but still i feel pretty shitty about it. I can't really talk about it to anyone because no one will believe me or they will just brush it off as jokes and games because every my father used to strip me off infront of them as a joke. So i just don't know maybe it just a joke and I'm over reacting","I think my cousin SAed me This is a repost i just felt that i left alot of things ((I don't know if this is an assault or not.

I feel crazy for having a sibling relationship with him.
I am most likely never going to tell anyone what he did to me, if my own brother didnt believe me i dont think anyone will. Its been so long they will probably just tell me to forgive and move on.

17660,1i4k6cb,post,Sex to fill the emptiness,"I’ve tried for so long to fill up the emptiness in me. I don’t know who I am anymore. I have started acting out of impulse again lately. Anything to take my mind off of the horrible fact that I hate myself. 

I’m a 19 year old male and had sex with an older man for money earlier. I was drunk, so I thought why not. I literally stayed with him all night just for the check, only for him not being willing to pay me after all of it, telling me he’d pay me ‘next time’. I feel disgusting and used. It’s not my first time with an older man, but this time it just felt wrong, like something has finally snapped in me. 

For the first time in a really long time, sex doesn’t appeal to me anymore. I mean, for fucks sake, I literally sucked dick at 4 years old so that should say something haha.  Sex has been something to help me cope these past few years. I usually do it drunk, so I don’t get nervous or back out.

But now.. I don’t know, it feels like a huge wave of depression has hit me and I can’t swim my way out of it anymore. I don’t like being myself, even though I don’t know who that self is. I’m constantly trying to fill the emptiness but nothing seems to work anymore, not even being impulsive and doing dumb or dangerous shit. 

I’m slowly but surely walking down a dark path, not really being able to do anything about it anymore. It seems that this life is just not something for me. 

I know this isn't really about sexual assault, but I feel that this is one of the only subreddits where I can describe stuff like this.

It made me feel so bad that when I finally broke up with him I had no feelings towards him anymore didn't have pity or anything it was weird, it was like he didn't mean anything to me as if all the year and a half we spent together didn't happened.

For me, BetterHelp has been what I’ve been using because the therapist I got matched with has been better than any of my previous therapists. I’ve also found journaling to be helpful, being able to write down all of what I’m feeling. For BetterHelp, as someone who’s a student, it’s about $200 a month for me, but I can meet with my therapist whenever and also join group therapy for sa survivors. I’m not trying to be a walking ad for BetterHelp, but it may be worth it if you’re struggling to find a therapist irl or prefer virtually meeting with someone. As well, if you have insurance, you can take the insurance card and call member services and ask them who is in network that’s near you and accepting new patients. You can also use the website psychologytoday.com to find a therapist and filter who is in network by insurance, meeting type, distance, types of therapy, etc. I’ve found cognitive behavioral therapy to be helpful for me.

If it’s too painful to think about the trauma, you can find a therapist that practices EMDR to lessen the emotions tied to the trauma. I hope any of this helps. This is just what has worked for me.

They said they had a dream where they got r@ped and it was the scariest thing to happen to them. I don’t discredit their feelings, as they are female and I know how scary that can be(I am AFAB). 

The part that upset me was when they said they felt even more bad for victims of SA for “that shit is worse than death”. I don’t know why this made me so angry but I think it has to do with them assuming they know what this feels like because of a dream. Not an actual event, a dream.

Was SA'd overseas as a child by a relative during a family trip. This stunted my development of my social skills as I become more quiet after the incident.

Throughout my schooling years I was heavily bullied due to the way I speak making me more reserved. And then I struggle as a functioning adult because of this, failing in job interviews, failing in dating, having a social college life etc. 

I work in multiple minimum wage jobs filled with young men and women who psychologically bully me. They say I'm like a serial killer or a robot and that creeps them out, uncanny valley vibes and avoid talking to me. Spread mean gossip about me like I'm mentally challenged. 

In college people ignored me icebreakers and i struggled with a social life or groupwork there. I did have some dates but they lose interest once i start opening my mouth (i don't say anything creepy, it's just the way i say it).

I can't talk about this without redditors thinking I'm intentionally being creepy towards people or assuming I am an lncel. 

And I cant be accepted in society or be a functional adult because of one incident. I don't think i can advance in life. Why am I still getting punished?

This went on for months (taking turns with each other ) and eventually I finally mustered up the courage to say no.

This went on for months (taking turns with each other ) and eventually I finally mustered up the courage to say no. It sounds terrible but after a while I was starting to enjoy it and just really wanted her to stay as my friend and be happy. Fast forward to high school I end up getting assaulted and I haven’t had a consensual sexual experience since 


I guess my question is , was what happened to me as a child SA and how do you get to the point where I can have consensual sex (I am terrified of even being kissed and have only kissed one person in 26 years )",1,3.0,2025-01-19 4:48,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1i4qncb/was_this_sa/,Neutral
17738,1i4qnh3,post,I don't know if this was sexual assault or if it was in my head,"At work I was asked to clean the bathrooms with one of my coworkers. This coworker was very upfront about flirting and making sexual comments but that never really bothered me, and sometimes I flirted back. We had even spoke about doing stuff together, but I had put it off and changed my mind. We went into the bathroom to clean it and he locked the door, and as he looked back and went to unlock it I said ""I didn't say you had to unlock it"". I don't know why I said that, and I wish so badly I hadn't. I turned around to start cleaning stuff and I turned back and he was pulling his penis out, and he asked me to suck it. I said ""no way, not at work"" and he asked again and I said ""maybe some other time"". He asked again and said ""please just for a second"" and I didn't know what to do, so I agreed. I stopped pretty quickly and got up, and he said ""come on one more"" and I didn't move, so he kissed me and said it again. I did it again and he was rough this time, and I pulled away again. He said ""one more"" again and guided my head and held me down, and I had to shove him off of me after a while because I couldn't get up. He finished after that time, and then went back to work like it didn't happen. 

I'm just so confused because I know I'd flirted with him in the past and even considered doing something with him, and I didn't directly say no. I feel so weird and gross now, and I don't know if it was even assault or if I just feel weird because of it being my first time.

17747,1i4rthq,post,I was sexually assaulted as a kid now I’m addicted to sex,"I’m currently a minor. As a very little kid, I was sexually abused by my grandfather. I only just remembered a very small bit of it. But I’ve always kinda known, and I’ve always been obsessed with sex since I was a kid.

But recently I’ve been getting really bad. My porn habits have become so disgusting, and I feel disgusting. 

Last summer I started seeking out older men to sext. I’d send videos and pictures of myself, I’d never even feel good about it. I don’t know why I can’t stop.

The things these men would say, and I’d go along with and encourage, I’m just angry at. They knew I was a minor, and preferred it.

One man was in his fourties, and I’d pretend to be his child. He would talk about wanting to rape me, and I’d go along with it. I fucking hate myself for all the things I’ve said to him and others.

I once met an eighteen year old, just graduated from high school. And this was the longest I had talked to someone. Eventually I didn’t want to do something one night, and he begged me to stay up for a few more minutes. 

Eventually I gave in and sent a video of myself, and ended up crying to sleep. I really thought he was nice but was just an asshole.

Idk what this is, I can’t say any of this to anyone. I just don’t want to be this way anymore. I feel like I didn’t have a childhood because I was abused, and never got to be innocent. I feel like there’s just something going to be wrong with me forever.","I was sexually assaulted as a kid now I’m addicted to sex I’m currently a minor.

17749,1i4ruza,post,My bf SA someone in his past ,"

My bf and I met October 15 2024. We met through a friend of his and we hit it off pretty good. Him, his friend, and I we watched funny videos and got drunk and I never felt happier. I haven’t had a friend since 10th grade and I am now graduated since June 2024. We talked for a couple of days and he came over and we decided to start dating. I’ve never felt so comfortable with a person. I can be completely normal with him. I can fart around him, making stupid noises, do stupid stuff, and be as immature as I want to be and he still thinks I am beautiful. We ended up even a month of us dating giving our virginity to eachother. One day in the beginning of November we got drunk. Now backstory before I tell this. My bf is born one year younger than me but one month only younger lol. When we met he was in a group home. Sure i didn’t understand it all but he explained that his parents just abandoned him at a mall. I believed the story and didn’t think none a less. His parents abised him by hitting him a belt and with there hands. They always were strict on him as they are from south africa. The mother has admitted to me that she has hit him and his step father has too but she said it’s because they grew up in a country where it’s allowed. They live in Canada now btw. Now one day we got drunk and I was a little emotional asking him why his parents hate him so much. When he actually told me the real truth. 2 years ago, he was playing hide and seek with his 4 year old sister. He made up a plan to get away from his family by doing what his grandpa did. His grandpa s*xu4l assaulted his older sister which is why they don’t talk to their grandfather. So he took the same advice and made sure his step father was looking and quickly put his hand down her pants touched her bum then sat in a corner. He said he was ready for anything. He didn’t care at the time of whether he lived or died or whether he was going to prison or be beaten he just wanted to get out. His mom and step father brought him to the police station where he spent a week locked up in juvenile center. He was eventually charged with sexual assault to a minor and he didn’t care of the consequences as he wanted to leave so he said guilty. He told social services what his family did to him but they said the only way they could do anything is by him charging them but he decided not to. His charges are only a youth charge and will be off in 2026. 

Sure it shocked me and I needed time to think. He said it was okay if i left him or said anything rude to him and he made sure to explain how he knows it’s a mistake and he won’t ever do anything ever again. He even brought me to his counselling session on his own terms. I believe he is doing the right steps to move forward from him offence. With this all in mind, my boyfriend was turning soon 18 at the time so he would be ageing out of social services. I made a joke to my grandma of him moving into our place but she said yes and said it would be a good idea with how his parents are. I live with my grandma but i live in the basement. Yes I told my grandma about his offence but she understand why he did it and that he is working forward to move past it. 

We have been living together since the middle of November and sure some things have been rough but we have gotten over it. He is never abusive maybe verbally he has said some things and I have too but we are all human. It’s everyone first time living too. Not giving myself or him an excuse but we are still teens. Both of us have celebrated our 18 birthday and we feel really happy with eachother. On the other hand, last month Icfinally told my mom the real story. She never really said much in the beginning was more on his side. I thought oh this went better than expected. I thought wrong as now almost everyday my mom has been talking about it, telling me to leave him, saying he’s a pedo, saying he will do it again, and saying over and over things that just shouldn’t be said. It has negativity impacted our relationship and Iccan tell my bf is depressed. My parents said they will try to find any way to get my bf to move out. My parents have been getting mad at my angry almost everyday and my grandma is always bothered by it.

17756,1i4sjeb,post,Was I Assaulted?,"Hey, 

I am a M(24) and this has been years ago however, I am needing advice. When I was 13 my older brother (step) was a freshman in HS. (14 1/2 almost 15) I was a 7th grader and he was constantly getting in trouble grounded etc. that being said one day he ask me to touch him and I was nervous and confused as he called it “truth or dare” I being not a “pussy” did so. At this time I did not know if liked it, but eventually I started to and it carried on until I was 14 (8th grade) and he was a sophomore in HS. I always knew it was wrong, but somethings I just didn’t really get at that time. Looking back after hitting 15-16 I knew what had happened was wrong. He also did this to my cousin as I once walked in on him and her (he was fingering her) before he did “truth or dare” with me he would always be naked on the bed (jumping), rubbing my ear to fall asleep etc. looking back I think I was groomed and assaulted. I have so much shame and guilt with this and have never told anyone. Was I assaulted? Or was this some weird incest thing? It only happened for a year, and it stopped. This was also around the time my dad (bio) had abused me physically. I am ridden with guilt and idk how to process this. I thought maybe you guys could give me some clarity. (Note I was raised with him since I was 5 and lived with him at age 7) ","Was I Assaulted? Hey,

17761,1i4sx33,post,Was this sa? I'm genuinely confused,"I guess this probably doesn't count but I guess a straight forward ""No it doesn't count"" is better than not knowing the answer (Keep in mind english isn't my first language) TW: Sexual stuff 

So there was this guy I went my last year of school with who sometimes kept insisting with stuff, for example there was this time he kept insisting to slap my butt so I eventually agreed, he did the same about kissing. A year later were both adults and I feel like trying something new, I have never had sex before but I knew this guy wasn't a virgin so I decided to ask him if he could teach me how to suck a dick, he said yes and he showed up to my house.

Now, I was in a bad place mentally at that time, so I shared my location with a friend because this guy is twice my size and I thought that somehow would keep me safe. We kiss, I don't feel anything, there's a little bit of foreplay and it doesn't do anything for me. Then he suggested to eat me out, which was something I didn't want to do, but I never told him that clearly, eventually he convinced me, I remember saying that it would probably smell as an excuse but he did it anyways. I wasn't turned on by it, so I just stared at the ceiling, sometimes looking at him, it was honestly disgusting but I did my best not to gag. And I guess he knew something was off because he asked me how I was doing and I guess I said ""okay"" instinctively, I tried to fake pleasure but then he started fingering me. It hurt, it hurt a lot, and I remember thinking I wanted it to stop, to be over it, but I didn't say no, I  didn't say stop. Eventually he stopped and then I began to try to keep my distance with him because I didn't want him to touch me down there again, so I kept checking the time on my phone because I wanted him to leave. Although I did suck his dick, in my mind I thought I needed him to come so this would be over but that didn't happen, he got nervous, I guess. He then insisted on penetration but I was terrified of it so I kept trying to make up excuses until he finally left. I know he couldn't have known I wasn't liking it but my brain is stupid and hasn't been able to be normal again after that. I just need to read that ""No it isn't""","Was this sa?

17777,1i4vjbr,post,I was assaulted and went back ,"
This is going to be a lot but I don’t know how to deal with it and I need advice 
I ‘21/F’ befriended a guy ‘23/M’ and believed we had a good friendship. I struggled making friends and when I was able to befriend him I felt less self conscious and with more confidence to make more.
After a while he began to involve himself more into my personal life, like who I hanged out with, what I liked to do, he began to judge my taste in clothes and hobbies. Then it came to him judging my long distance relationship, which I was very happy with and truly in love. 
He started saying that what I was doing was nonsense and lame and that my bf ‘21M’ was bad news (he’s truly not and is actually the sweetest guy) but he ’23M’ began to twist every single aspect of my relationship and filled me with insecurities that it wasn’t going to work.
I have to say I was very mentally weak and for some reason I believed him, just to have his approval after him judging every aspect of my life. So he told me to break up with my bf and I did.
After that, he invited himself over to my house under the excuse he wanted to watch a movie with me and see what I thought. But he took no time to force me to undress for him and I said no, that I was not comfortable. He berated me telling me I should be used to doing this since “I wasn’t a virgin” and I shouldn’t have a problem doing this for him, that I should be used to it. After struggling to keep my shirt on I gave in to finish it up quickly and he began to touch me. Things thankfully did not escalate because he said he was just practicing “for when he actually likes someone “ and he didn’t want to involve himself with someone who wasn’t “pure”

After this i didn’t see him again and ignored his texts
I felt disgusting and confused and enraged. 

After 2 years he reached out to me and asked if we could get a coffee, I agreed and tbh I don’t know why, i just wanted to see what he had to say if he felt sorry for what happened, if he knew how he made me feel?
None of that happen, he casually started to talk like nothing but I confronted him and told him what had happened was wrong. This escalated the conversation and he twisted it and told me it was my fault for not leaving and that I should of done more for him to stop. That I persuade him. It made me sick to my stomach, but I believed him and just like that I was back where I was 2 years ago, wanting to please him.

At this time me and my bf had come back together and I had told him what happen ,
But I kept seeing the other guy ,
And whenever he felt like touching me I would let him and it wouldn’t escalate to more. 
I was cheating for validation. And I was disgusted and mentally drained. I knew it was wrong but I felt wanted and my punishment was being constantly grabbed on so he would want to see me again since I felt so alone which is no excuse.
(I want to clarify that it was not romantically nor sexual from my part most of the time I would only look at the ceeling emotionless and wanting it to be over since it was so disgusting) 

After a while he escalated things and forced me down and tried to remove
my shorts, I immediately freaked out and told him to get off (he is 6,2 and I am 5,5) but I wasn’t able to get him off, he hit me from behind and left me bruises all over my butt and I began to cry that it hurt, he didn’t stop. Until, for a second I thought he finally heard me cry, since he stopped, I couldn’t move out of fear and was so happy it was over.  He ended up  pushing me down even further and with more force and out of the corner of my eye I noticed he was recording everything. He did not penetrate me, which what I thought was going to happen and I was ready to die a little inside
But he ended up coming on my leg. I froze 
I was disgusted and full of fear. I couldn’t even make a sound .
He chuckled and said sorry, that he got “carried away” but that he was not going to have “sex” with me since I wasn’t a “virgin “ so I got up and locked myself in the restroom and waited for him to leave.

I was traumatized ,
And feelt like it was my punishment for cheating, if that’s what even happen .
I’m so confused now.
I confided in my friend with all of what had happen and showed her the bruises by sending pictures.
My bf found them on my phone and immediately broke up with me,
Which I understood,
And felt like I had no say.
After conversations I finally was able to tell him what happen and we were able to work things out .
We are healthier now. 
But I still feel like there’s a lot I need to figure out and for that I would want to first  be able to identity what had happen

I confided in my friend with all of what had happen and showed her the bruises by sending pictures.
My bf found them on my phone and immediately broke up with me,
Which I understood,
And felt like I had no say.
After conversations I finally was able to tell him what happen and we were able to work things out .
We are healthier now. 
But I still feel like there’s a lot I need to figure out and for that I would want to first  be able to identity what had happen

17782,1i4vwtq,post,Did schools investigate if students were being sexually abused at home? ,"Well like the title says, did schools in the 90s or prior ever have legal grounds to investigate if a student was going through sexual abuse? 

For background, I was in pre school in 1998-1999, this isnt much of a repressed memory for me, but I have always known that in pre school I had a hymen inspection. My mom can confirm that this did happen. One day I arrived to school, and a school bus took me to a clinic to have this exam conducted by a professional. My mom was notified, and I’m sure signed some kind of document, and was at that same facility waiting for me as my legal guardian. She said that during the exam I was my normal self, giggling and what not. I didn’t realize how odd this was until I got to college. I asked my mom about it, and she said the school offered this to all the students. But as I recall I was the only one that went, when I mentioned this to her she looked surprised. I have gone to my local school district trying to get more answers but that pre school program has gone through a lot since I was a student. And there are pretty much no records, or employees that can help me get answers. So my question is, did anyone else experiences anything like this? Was this a thing back then? Even if as a child, I raised questions of being a victim wouldn’t a school take a different approach? I really don’t know where else I can ask such a thing. But I’ve always been curious. This happened on Los Angeles Ca. ","Did schools investigate if students were being sexually abused at home?

17783,1i4w1ny,post,I don’t know what to do ,"Hello,

I posted on here not that long ago and I wanted to give an update/ more info on my situation. I am struggling a lot with my mental health and I have been diagnosed with bpd and bipolar disorder, my friend who I wrote about last time on this Reddit (a guy a year older than me who I am trying to come to terms with had assaulted me while I was drunk)  is now I believe becoming my abuser. When we first met it was an instant connection since I never really had a lot of friends bcs I was to anxious around people and I felt like I had finally gotten a friend who actually cared. He knows all of my history, all my new friends are in a way connected to him and he is always one of the first people I would go to when I was struggling. After he did those things to me I was going to try and distance myself but it’s really hard because I feel depressed and lonely whenever I’m not able to talk to him or others. And recently we began talking and hanging out again bcs I was hoping I could put it all behind me because I’m just trying to get over it. But every times I hang out with him he starts touching me and asking me to sit on his lap and I told him before I’m not comfortable with it and I don’t want him to do those things because I have ptsd from other situations like this and I start crying every time but he hasn’t stopped. I don’t understand why I’m overwhelmed with this guilt when I’m not able to talk to him and I know that it’s so easy to just stop talking or interacting with him but I have these pains when I try to like I am afraid of being abandoned and alone. If I tell my friends I know they will be mad and it’s even worse bcs he has a partner who is one of my best friends as well but if I tell his partner I know he would break up with him but my “assaulter” might threaten suicide on both of us and it would cause things to be even worse. I kinda have to suffer alone on this one but I just needed a place to rant and possibly get advice. 

Please even if the advice could hurt me leave it, I appreciate everyone here and I hope even one on this sub Reddit is having a really good day. Thank you for listening if you made it this far, you really didn’t have to so thank you. So sorry for ranting so much. ","I don’t know what to do  Hello,

17796,1i4ybij,post,How to support GF who used to be in an abusive relationship?,"Hello, all. I (19F) have recently entered a relationship with a gorgeous woman (20F) – she’s funny and smart and delightful. She’s  also been through hell and back: in her last relationship, she was sexually assaulted several times, as well as emotionally abused. She is still coming to terms with the fact that what happened to her was abuse and assault – she didn’t realise until recently, and I think very few of her friends know that this was going on. Her family aren’t likely to be very supportive, either. 

I really love her beyond belief, and honestly want nothing more than for her to be safe and happy. But I don’t know what I can do to support her – while I’m trying to listen to her whenever possible, and encouraging her to seek professional help, I really feel like I should be able to do more for her. And moreover, I’m really scared of potentially hurting her more or retriggering old injuries. But I also don’t wanna patronise her or make her feel like her trauma makes her untouchable. 

As such, I wanna ask: is there anything that I should do to be there for her while she comes to terms with this? And is there anything I shouldn’t do?

17826,m80583r,comment,,"I have tried my best to immediately cut off all ties to anyone who raped or assaulted me in any way. I find it to be the best and safest decision imo while also being more peaceful...It also makes it a little less likely that I'd have to worry about that sort of happening again; However, there have been a few exceptions (usually temporary-or until I realized the extent of the assault and damages) There is one distant extended family member to my brother's side of the family who I kept contact with for several years due to the assaults happening at such a young age and not thinking much of it at the time...I did cut ties after about 10 or so years but sometimes still encounter randomly at another relatives house. Being as young as I was and having not felt as traumatized by it as I had in other SA situations I just keep it to myself to keep the peace when we do cross paths but it's still awkward as it's always the first thought that comes to mind and nearly all I can think about while in the same room. After so many encounters I had eventually in time ended up oddly enjoying when it happened as it wasn't violent/painful like other experiences and so along with that I didn't want to lose the closest thing I had at the time to feeling loved/wanted/pretty or whatever.

There I'm sure are a lot of situations where people keep the SA on the hush hush due to fear of retaliation, family devision, as well as being invalidated, or simple personal insecurities or issues that may be circumstantial.

At a younger age there was a group of young boys who ""wanted to play a game with me"" in a neighbors shed...Needless to say it wasn't so much of a game as it was just them taking their turns. After evening finished I was SO embarrassed and afraid to even leave the shed because my legs were covered in blood.
I was also too afraid to tell me mom as she has always been the type to sexualize everyone and even would try to make me have boyfriends from a VERY young age.
I ran to my Nana aa soon as I didn't see anyone around and immediately told her, but to my surprise she didn't want to report it (I first thought because of them also being so young it wouldn't have accomplished much)  later I realized she happens to just be one of those people who won't express, expose, or hold accountable any such actions (maybe due to her own assault within the family, idk) She also always believed if SA victims told the truth that they would like cause more problems, trauma, and/or be seen as either a liar or ""tainted"" and unpure so that was conflicting af.
When I did open up to my mom about it years later she fully rejected the possibility and made me realize my Nana wasn't entirely wrong as it seems people really do not care about SA victims experiences as much as they should or will even immediately assume it's a lie or something (like wtf) ... Victim blaming and disbelief is also a thing I'm sure scares people away from opening up (especially when having family who protects/hides such situations)
I now will always try my best to fully defend myself and express/warn/expose any such situations. I no longer keep any active contact with anyone who violated me sexually and hope to never have to either. 
I also feel as if having something like that happen is likely to invite more people with those sorts of intentions until you let it be known that you don't support, protect, or downplay these actions."," I have tried my best to immediately cut off all ties to anyone who raped or assaulted me in any way.

My ex, who sexually assaulted me, mentioned something weird to me a few months into our relationship that I keep thinking about. I’m looking to see if this is something Is should have jumped ship for immediately after hearing it, so I can give myself some closure and clarity.

Many years ago, when my ex was in high school and college he used to babysit a group of boys and girls in his neighborhood. The kids apparently loved hanging out with him and he would often play lawn games with them. He was describing this and at the time I thought it was cute and funny. But in this conversation he said something like he thought it was funny and awkward because the kids would sometimes hug him and their face would he in his crotch or they would climb on him and accidentally touch his dick. 

Since this was such a long time ago I said it was a weird thing to remember or bring up now and he said it was something he just does (remember). It was also weird because when we told me he looked at me in some expectant way. Idk what he was trying to do by telling me this but I thought it was weird. Is it?

17877,m823tlh,comment,,"this is a very common reaction to sexual violence! it's often a way to try to reclaim control over your body and/or sex, although it can also be a form of self-harm.

if you find yourself seeking out dangerous or dehumanizing situations sexually (eg deliberately getting blackout drunk in the hopes someone will assault you, sleeping with/trying to sleep with guys you find gross and/or shitty, deliberately not using protection to risk STI exposure or pregnancy, etc), that's probably self harm. it's a normal reaction, people often try to punish themselves after being assaulted because ""I must have done something to deserve it."" but it's also really dangerous, and it doesn't go away on its own. you should talk to a therapist about it to get to the root of why you want to punish yourself and try to relearn self-love.

but if you're not specifically seeking out dangerous or hurtful sex, and are just generally experiencing a higher sex drive, that's likely an attempt to reclaim your body and your sexuality. there's nothing wrong with that, and as long as it doesn't go against your personal values, you should absolutely allow yourself to indulge (safely). focus on consent and transparency so that you can have really good, mutually enjoyable & respectful sexual experiences, and this will usually fade over time (and it's perfectly fine if it doesn't, cuz you're not hurting yourself or anyone else!). if sex goes against your personal values (eg if you come from a conservative Christian background), this can be really difficult to grapple with, and I would suggest navigating it with a therapist -- *not* a member of your religious community because that can get super toxic super fast.

a third possibility is that the assault taught you ""my only worth is as a sexual object for others,"" and now you're trying to fulfill that idea so you can feel valuable. this is also dangerous and can be really hurtful to you, and also doesn't go away on its own, and should be discussed with a therapist. a common clue for this one is if you find yourself feeling especially sexual when you're sad, lonely, embarrassed, or otherwise hurting.

17892,1i5d3w4,post,I was raped a year ago by my crush and best friend.,"I was in 7th grade when all of this happened. I was dealing with a lot of mental health issues while being neglected and living in an abusive home with a narcissist. It all happened when I started talking to this guy, let's call him kaleb. I could tell kaleb had a crush on me at the start, he was always very eager to talk to me and he sometimes would make sexual jokes about me. I didn't like it at first because I had a girlfriend at the time and didn't like him like that, but over time, I started to see kaleb as more than a friend. Yes, I know it's fucked up. Having a girlfriend while also having a crush on my boy best friend. I never flirted with him though. I didn't like having feelings for him because I knew it was wrong. Kaleb was very supportive and he knew about my home life with my dad and his violent tendencies. He told me I could come over at any time if I wanted to and we could just chill and have fun. I agreed. We set up to see each other on Sunday, December 2nd, 2023. This would be the worst and most traumatizing day of my life. It took a lot of convincing with my dad, I had to lie and tell him kaleb is gay. (Which was most definitely a lie) and after I told him that ""small"" lie, he agreed. When I went to his house, it was normal. He let me just watch him play video games on his pc and I was fine with that. I was happy. I felt safe. Later in the day, when it was getting close for me to leave, I started to have a mental breakdown on the thought of seeing my dad again. Kaleb comforted me. He said it would be okay and he'll always be there for me. I felt safe again. He then asked if I had ate that day, I answered honestly and told him I had only ate a couple of cold onion rings. He got his mom to get us pizza and I was happy. I felt loved and cared for, which my dad could never offer. When Kaleb's mom got the pizza, he insisted I got some soda as well.. i told him i wasn't a big soda fan and he asked if I'd like some water, I said yes. I offered to get the glass myself but he insisted I stayed in his room and he got the water for me. Thinking he was just trying to be polite, I agreed and waited patiently. I took about 5 minutes. When he came back and gave me my water, I noticed it looked weird, like something was coming up at the top of the glass. I felt his eyes on me as I looked at the glass and got nervous and drank most of it. Maybe 20 minutes after I drank that water I then started to get sleepy. Horribly sleepy. My dad had already called Kaleb's mom that night and told her I could stay the night because he had to work really late and would just pick me up in the morning so I already knew i was staying the night.. I think he could tell i was getting tiredbecause he told me he was getting sleepy and wanted to go to bed. so I agreed. I obviously couldn't sleep in the same room as him so his mom let me sleep on the living room couch, I fell asleep almost immediately but before I did, I saw kaleb behind the couch. I wanted to ask him ""what are you doing?"" But I was so out of it, i said nothing. I woke up sore and bloody in my vaginal area that morning. I knew what had happened. Kaleb drugged me and raped me in my sleep. Kaleb's mom was at work that night, so nobody could've stopped him. That day when my dad picked me up from his house and was asking me how it went, I just agreed that it was fine. I couldn't ever tell him I was raped by Kaleb. He'd tell the police and then I could never talk to him ever again. After that whole incident, kaleb started avoiding me, ignoring me even. I hated my life. And soon after I had to transfer schools for personal reasons. I told the school counselor what had happened after 3 months of going to that new school. She got the police involved and kaleb blocked me on discord and put his username as ""FUCK:myname:!!!!!!"" The police didn't even let me use a rape kit because there was no evidence he did anything to me.

17893,1i5di58,post,I know that this is something bad. I just don’t know what it’s called. (also my story.) ,"So it's been less than a few months since this happened


I was on the special ed bus (it's for disabled people) like normal except we have an assistant on the special ed bus and he went back to his homeland and he's returning in the spring so in the meantime, we have a substitute That people call Mr. Jonathan

I met him on a bus with a different bus driver, so I was already familiar with him except he was always pretty annoying and he has this voice that just sounds like he should clear his throat . 

And I'm very social just not on public transportation and I take that as my moment to just stare out the window and enter  La La Land . Yet he doesn't understand that he was always just bugging me and bugging me every time I saw him.

And one time he was talking about like we'll just put it as ""woman for personal entertainment"" mind you this when I first met him and that was a very bad impression already! 


And this is where it gets even worse because one day I made the mistake of wearing shorts, a thin jacket and a jersey to school because I didn't think the weather would be that bad

And I I was honestly just laughing about it and didn't really care and I was just so ready to go home for the afternoon because everybody was already getting loaded into their buses, walking home, etc.

But that's when all of a sudden he bends down in front of me and he looks at me kind of almost as if he wanted to smirk. I don't know how to describe it . It was a bit of a blur because I didn't know how to react but he holds two fingers and he starts squeezing my upper thigh and just touching it. And I was in a seatbelt and I was in utter shock.

So I just kinda moved his hand away gently and asked ""i'm sorry what are you doing?"" or something like that and he was so intently focused on my leg that it took him a moment to look at me, but then he said the most dumbest excuse a.k.a. ""I'm trying to see if you're skinny."" 

I don't exactly remember how things ended from there, but one thing I do know is that even though I reported it to the counselor, the school did absolutely nothing and they only replaced him for like two days for God knows what reason and then he just came back like rised from the dead.

And since then he hasn't been talking to me, but there's this slight gap in between where I sit, and where a kindergarten sits? (yes kindergartners do go on my bus and I will get into more of that in a second.) and he just stands there when I'm boarding the bus. And there's a kid in a wheelchair and whenever he unloads her. (unfortunately he is the one loading and unloading her on and off the bus.) and this week he's been standing pretty close to me when he does that which I don't know how he does it considering he has to be on the other end of the bus to do that.

And my birthday was on Thursday, and I caught him looking at me and since a TA was holding my bag. I very quickly got up on a step thing? (I don't know how to describe it.) and I just ran.

And not to mention now he's closer to the younger kids and two of them are brothers (the youngest is in kindergarten. The older one is in second grade and the little boy sitting in the row across from them is in first grade) and everyone whether you ride a normal bus or not sits in the cafeteria while they wait for their bus and I obviously wasn't looking at this dude, but I'm friends with the two brothers .

And there was this time where he grabbed a big almost family size, bag of popcorn, and he was insisting they have a bit and only halfway through his begging did he bother to ask THE BUS DRIVER and yeah, it makes sense because the bus driver and their mom are friends, but you need to ask the mom first. And either way the oldest brother was denying it saying that they were both good and they didn't want any


And another time he shouted at the oldest ""LOOK AT ME..."" and then I don't exactly know what he said, but he said something basically DEMANDING that the poor boy do something like put his hands on his head or put his hands on another part of his body or something. I think it was put your hands on your head, but I don't exactly know.

And he keeps making the bus driver defend him whenever  the brothers and the first grade boy are ""misbehaving"" and back to what he was doing to me 

On the same day, he touched me. He also started making weird remarks like ""ha ha you have a nice beach tan and then he started pointing to my body I think he was pointing at my leg. I can't remember, but he knew that was my natural skin color. 

And the bus driver has been my bus driver since preschool (although I didn't ride her bus for a short time) and she was sticking up for me saying that that was my natural skin color and then I was kind of ticked off already because I have a very short temper 

And then when I was about to step down to the second step, he said ""hey I think I know why you wanted to wear shorts"" and then I responded with ""OK why is that?"" ""so you could show off your legs."" And then he did this weird laugh and I just got off the bus because what the hell. And about a couple weeks prior he just screamed ""I NEED ME A SOUTH AMERICAN WOMAN"" and then he proceeded to say ""hit me up if you know any!"" Because he knows that pretty much my entire bloodline is Brazilian, which is just really weird. And I forgot to mention one day he asked those kids on my bus who are brothers

""what grade are you in?"" of course the oldest responded second grade the youngest responded kindergarten and Mr. Jonathan just thought for a moment and said ""well I'm not in a grade"" and then he began to think again (I know that he was thinking because he kept taking long pauses and kind of stuttering) and then he said ""well I guess I'm in grade 58"" which you can tell is his age and at the time that he did what he did to me, I was barely a teenager and I'm not even old enough to drive yet .

And very recently, our bus broke down, and my bus driver was holding my hand to help me walk to our new bus and my knees were kinda wobbly, but I was fine and I didn't even get injured or anything, but he just came up behind me and scooped me under the armpits when I was looking at the floor. Like excuse me? And I didn't say anything, but on our new bus for the time being we had a new bus driver and a new bus assistant yet he still rode on the new bus anyway which I highly doubt was necessary.

But anyway, yeah, that's it ","I know that this is something bad. I just don’t know what it’s called. (also my story.)  So it's been less than a few months since this happened

And either way the oldest brother was denying it saying that they were both good and they didn't want any


And another time he shouted at the oldest ""LOOK AT ME..."" and then I don't exactly know what he said, but he said something basically DEMANDING that the poor boy do something like put his hands on his head or put his hands on another part of his body or something. I think it was put your hands on your head, but I don't exactly know.

And he keeps making the bus driver defend him whenever  the brothers and the first grade boy are ""misbehaving"" and back to what he was doing to me 

On the same day, he touched me. He also started making weird remarks like ""ha ha you have a nice beach tan and then he started pointing to my body I think he was pointing at my leg. I can't remember, but he knew that was my natural skin color. 

And the bus driver has been my bus driver since preschool (although I didn't ride her bus for a short time) and she was sticking up for me saying that that was my natural skin color and then I was kind of ticked off already because I have a very short temper 

And then when I was about to step down to the second step, he said ""hey I think I know why you wanted to wear shorts"" and then I responded with ""OK why is that?"" ""so you could show off your legs."" And then he did this weird laugh and I just got off the bus because what the hell. And about a couple weeks prior he just screamed ""I NEED ME A SOUTH AMERICAN WOMAN"" and then he proceeded to say ""hit me up if you know any!"" Because he knows that pretty much my entire bloodline is Brazilian, which is just really weird. And I forgot to mention one day he asked those kids on my bus who are brothers

""what grade are you in?"" of course the oldest responded second grade the youngest responded kindergarten and Mr. Jonathan just thought for a moment and said ""well I'm not in a grade"" and then he began to think again (I know that he was thinking because he kept taking long pauses and kind of stuttering) and then he said ""well I guess I'm in grade 58"" which you can tell is his age and at the time that he did what he did to me, I was barely a teenager and I'm not even old enough to drive yet .

And very recently, our bus broke down, and my bus driver was holding my hand to help me walk to our new bus and my knees were kinda wobbly, but I was fine and I didn't even get injured or anything, but he just came up behind me and scooped me under the armpits when I was looking at the floor. Like excuse me? And I didn't say anything, but on our new bus for the time being we had a new bus driver and a new bus assistant yet he still rode on the new bus anyway which I highly doubt was necessary.

But anyway, yeah, that's it ",1,1.0,2025-01-20 0:22,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1i5di58/i_know_that_this_is_something_bad_i_just_dont/,Neutral

17899,1i5eqby,post,i don’t know if this counts as sexual assault,"bit of context i guess? i was with my ex boyfriend for about a year and a half, broke up ab 8/9 months ago, and also came to the conclusion i was a lesbian quite quickly after. 

i was talking to a friend about our toxic exes yesterday and he said something that made something click for me and i don’t know how to cope with the possibility. 

my ex used to try and initiate sex, and when id turn him down he’d turn over in bed, act all sad and wouldn’t talk to me or just be really mean about it. i ended up just doing it with him sometimes to get it over with because i felt really guilty about us not having an active sec life cuz i was dealing with mental health issues that caused my libido to drop, on top of again, me being closeted. 

he would constantly ask to shower with me and i tried to turn him down but sometimes he’d just keep asking to even let him watch me shower. i felt so objectified but idk, i thought that was just kinda normal cuz he was my boyfriend. 

i always felt guilty and i feel like he used that to his advantage to try and get something from me. i don’t know if any of that even counts as sexual assault but im trying not to break down at the possibility that it might be and that it took me this long to realise. 

it’s my birthday as well and everything else in my life is going really well, so this just really sucks out of all days. i’m sorry if this doesn’t make any sense, i’m a bit all over the place but feel free to ask questions for clarity or something","i don’t know if this counts as sexual assault bit of context i guess? i was with my ex boyfriend for about a year and a half, broke up ab 8/9 months ago, and also came to the conclusion i was a lesbian quite quickly after.

17902,1i5erqt,post,Do sa survivors still have sex?,"
This is a complex question but for context I’m currently writing a story. It’s supposed to be a smut type story but I really want to give it a good storyline and add depth to all the characters. The main male character is supposed to struggle with annoying parents who favor his brother, and one thing that happened to him (the readers will find out later in the book) is that he was almost assaulted when he was a child. When he was little he used to work at a small modeling agency and one of the photographers ends up manipulating him and it results in him taking his clothes off and the photographer takes photos of him. Nothing else happens to him but the memory ends up getting repressed in his head. But at the start of the book we don’t know this and neither does he since it’s a repressed memory. And throughout the book he ends up having sex many times. I just want to ask if his storyline makes sense and if it’s normal for sa/grooming survivors with repressed memories to have sex comfortably before they find out what happened to them if that makes sense. Since I’ve heard a lot of survivors of repressed sa trauma usually don’t want people to touch them or they fear sex. But in the end everybody is different right?","Do sa survivors still have sex?

We’ve been together for a little under a year. They were in a sexually abusive relationship in high school and was assaulted again in college (we’re 22)

Recently, they were having a bit of an emotional breakdown to me about their self-esteem and many of their internal self image issues and how this is manifesting in our relationship. I listened and was empathetic and I don’t hold any ill towards them. I’m completely there for them and I understand. However, they said something concerning that I’ve been trying to shake from my mind.

They told me they don’t understand why sexual assault is seen as “that bad.” They admitted that whenever they hear cases of SA victims talking about how SA altered and even ruined their lives, they view these victims as dramatic. I asked them when did these views develop and they told me they don’t know if they’ve always felt this way or if it was coping. I proposed it sounded like coping.

Ever since then, I’ve been trying not to think about this statement. I hate to admit it, but I feel disturbed even though I know, and I think they know, this view is a coping mechanism. I don’t want to share my body with them any more, not because I think they’re any sort of bad person, but now im self conscious that if they do something I don’t like they’re not gonna take me seriously. I’m relooking at our past encounters of me setting sexual boundaries differently now. I’ve shared sexual harassment experiences with them and now I’m wondering did they just view me as dramatic too? I don’t know what to do, if I should bring this up, or just swallow it and keep being there for them. I don’t want to make this journey about myself but equally I don’t know what to do with that information that they allegedly don’t take sexual assault seriously. I want to support them but I don’t want to push. I know this is a sensitive subject and I don’t want them to feel shamed for sharing what they shared with me.

17923,1i5gc44,post,He has schizophrenia and he’s homeless ,"Reposting: I know this is abusive but I don’t know what legally to do or what it’s classified under 

I feel crazy and gaslit by his family who dont acknowledge his behavior 

We’ve been together for 4 years and we have good moments and nice times but there are times where I fee so trapped and alone and scared. Like what do I keep doing wrong. I just feel like whenever something crazy happens time goes by and it feels like I just made it up and things are back to being fine.

He slapped me in the face while I was sitting down crying; I don’t even remember what started that argument but the more I cried in our apartment the angrier he would get.
	2.	He pushed me into a towel rack  and it got dented. When he got so mad that when I tossed him his pants a part of it hit his face or eye (and that wasn’t my intention it was an accident) and he got so angry that he pulled my hair hair and pinched me. 
	
I kept refusing  to drink a shroom tea because I didn’t want to and it looked gross and he kept putting it near my mouth and when I gestured to just stop and move it away it spilled and he got so mad he slapped me in the face and I started crying and he kept calling me a stupid bitch and that I’m the problem and I’m a whore  
	
He came to my apartment in a rage after drinking and mad that I dropped him at his brothers place and went back home to my apartment— he stormed in saying I abandoned him and he ripped my shirt off my body in half and threw my bedding and stuff  around, and was just pacing and yelling and would periodically throw me on the bed and yell at me

The first time he grabbed my neck was when I was half naked and he was mad about something and afterwards I had to do a zoom meeting and my voice was scratchy but he’s done that a few times in the last few years. Whenever I call him out of something he’d say that it’s sexual and I’m a liar but I don’t think it is all the time 

At times he wouldn’t let me go to work or he wouldn’t leave to go to work in the mornings or drive me without  having sex and I’d be crying at times because I was so annoyed or frustrated especially early in the morning, regardless of whether I was tired or running late. He would threaten not to drive me if I didn’t want to or just be so mean 

	sometimes He would pinch my breasts really hard during sex if he couldn’t get aroused or was frustrated, and I’d start crying because I kept asking what did I do what’s wrong and he would say it’s because I’m a bitch or a whore who cheats and that’s why he can’t get hard and I wouldn’t want to have sex anymore but he wouldn’t prevent me from getting dressed and make me stay in a certain position until he got hard and then we’d have sex and I’d be crying still because he was so mean about it 

One time, he climbed on top of me and hit me multiple times in the head because I accidentally hit him in the eye when handing him his pants.

Neighbors called security once after hearing me crying, him yelling, and him throwing me around the room. And he was screaming at them through the wall calling them whores and that he was going to kill them. And then he said it’s my fault 
	
He drove erratically while pulling my hair, threatening that we would both die because I was talking about leaving or moving away. And I had a bad panic attack because he’d be shouting at me and I felt so trapped. 

He would pinch and hit me when I was naked if we were about to have sex and he was angry or frustrated and like hurting me he was pinching me or doing something  and his cousin came in the room to tell us to be quiet  because they heard us fighting or me crying and him yelling at me. He got even angrier, blaming me for someone seeing me naked and that it was my fault. 

A few times He would insist on “inspecting” me to see if I’d been with anyone else, even though he was cheating in different ways himself. 

During sex, if he couldn’t get hard, he would pull my hair and neck back, pinch me, and call me names, and if I said it hurt he would make fun of me or call me names or do it more. 

He once bit my face in anger and he  would hold my arms down and hit or poke me in the chest, and I couldn’t get up. 

When his brother was staying in the same room for weeks he would make me have sex in the bathroom and I felt so uncomfortable because he was right outside the door living on our floor and at times I would say things during sex would hurt and he wouldn’t stop or wouldn’t care because he just wanted to keep going and he got annoyed once after I questioned it and he picked me up against the door and yelled at me 

Another time, he climbed on top of me and kept hitting me in the head, digging his nails into me repeatedly while I was pinned down, scratching and pinching me.

After I accidentally hit his eye with his pants, he demanded I take him to urgent care. Before that, he grabbed me, hit me, pulled my hair, and shoved me into a towel rack, leaving scratches on me. I begged him to stop and was crying a lot and wanted to do anything for him to leave me alone 

When I first got high with him early in relationship I think he was fingering me when I was half asleep and/or started to have sex when I was half asleep or asleep 

He acts as though his actions are justified, blaming me by saying I’m a “cheater” or a “bitch” because I want to spend time with family or friends. He has his own trauma and mental health issues, and he makes me feel so guilty about everything. I’m incredibly attached to the idea of helping him, even though his actions have left me deeply hurt and confused.


But I can’t hurt him with reporting anything because he’s already lost everything and is homeless after I left ","He has schizophrenia and he’s homeless  Reposting: I know this is abusive but I don’t know what legally to do or what it’s classified under

17927,m83m0tz,comment,,"I’m going to be blunt here because it seems like what you need right now.

There is nothing you can do on your own to improve their mindset. You are not qualified, and while you can be supportive, let them talk to you, and be a shoulder for them to cry on they need therapy, and you both should consider couple’s counseling. Your fears, while entirely valid, will only get worse the longer you let this simmer. The longer you let this go without having a proper conversation with some sort of unbiased mediator, your fears will only become a more and more frequent thought in your mind. 

As far as things you can do for the time being at home, I would firmly discuss boundaries, both of your boundaries. Set both verbal and non verbal safe words/ signals for when boundaries are crossed. For example, the stop light system is commonly used; Green means good, yellow means take a break, red means stop immediately. For non verbal signals, make sure it’s something that can be easily done and easily felt in the heat of the moment; A pinch, a light slap, etc. After every time a boundary is broken or a new boundary is set, take a few moments to yourselves and then discuss it. How did it make you feel? Why did it make you feel that way? What can both of you do to avoid crossing this boundary in the future?

Remember— I, You, We Statements: *I* feel this way because *you* did this, how can *we* fix this?

This should give you a good start if you implement it, and best of luck!"," I’m going to be blunt here because it seems like what you need right now.

17929,1i5gjcb,post,Recorded in the shower by my friend ,"Hi, 

Im not sure if this is the right place but just wanted to ask for some opinions/advice im a bit confused and not sure if im overthinking or what. 

About 10 years ago i was staying at a friends house (we are both males and were still at school). I had a weird vibe from him the night before and the next day i was showering and noticed his phone propped up against the wall recording. I was obviously very shocked and confused, i turned the video off deleted it and put the phone back. I never said anything but i saw him go in and get it a little while later. 

I told other friends about it and word got around. I felt bad about it but i really didnt know what to do at the time i thought he was trying to take the piss out of me and show people. I forgave him (ive known him my whole life) and a year or 2 later he came out as gay. 
This made a lot more sense to me and we spoke about it again. 

I cant help but think that it might have had an effect on me mentally. I have really struggled with anxiety and trust for as long as i can remember when i used to be a very confident person. I never put these things together for the whole time since the recording. In this time me and this friend stayed in the same friendship group but drifted, it was like there was something between us that i couldnt put my finger on. We felt anxious around eachother. 

The weird thing is i think my brain had pushed the memory of recording to somewhere else. I never thought about it until a year ago when he brought it up and said how bad he felt about it. 

The last 10 years have been very hard for me. Theres been a lot of things that have gone on jn my life (bereavement and family issues) and i have really struggled with addiction and self destructive behaviour. Ive had no sexual partners because my anxiety around that sort of thing is terrible. Its not that i havent had the opportunities, i have always had girls after me im not bad looking and was very popular at school/university but have always been too anxious to get past the ‘talking phase’. Although ive had only positive experiences with girls i have also had a real issue with the way i look. Ive obsessed over mainly my face but every part of my body. Like ive said, ive only ever had positive comments and people can never believe that i am so seld conscious. I was genuinely not well in my head, i really struggled with substance abuse and my parents actually considered sectioning me at one point. Ive had to drop my whole life (uni , friends etc) and start again. 

Im sorry for the long story but i guess my question is do you think it would be valid to blame some of my anxieties on this? A lot of other things have happened in this time but i am trying to work out if its serious enough to have had an effect.

Like i said, i hadnt thought about it until last year when he wanted to talk. Since then ive noticed it makes me feel quite overwhelmed. He has apologised so much and i have always forgave him we were young at the end of the day and he was the only gay person at our school (closeted) so probably felt very confused himself.

Ive looked for other posts/ help but it seems it is mostly females that have been recorded by males not males… just a little confused.

im sorry if this isnt the right place for this post but if not please let me know and ill remove.

17937,m83qm6z,comment,,"It isn’t unusual after being assaulted to have a higher sex drive, it is your body and minds way of coping with the assault itself. 

It can feel really frustrating when this happens because it seems like you should be doing the opposite but there is no wrong way of coping with something like this. 

I really suggest therapy to help you understand exactly why you have reacted this way as there can be a few reasons behind it. And I’m pretty sure that if you tell your therapist about the rape, they will most likely ask if you want to report it and go on with an investigation, this is up to you though, a good therapist wouldn’t force you to report it, they would simply help you work through the trauma of it. 

I completely understand, I reacted in a similar way after my assault years ago, but due to my fear of men I never was able to act on it with another person because of the anxiety I had. But working though it has really helped me come to terms with what happened to me, so maybe it can also help you."," It isn’t unusual after being assaulted to have a higher sex drive, it is your body and minds way of coping with the assault itself. 

It can feel really frustrating when this happens because it seems like you should be doing the opposite but there is no wrong way of coping with something like this. 

I really suggest therapy to help you understand exactly why you have reacted this way as there can be a few reasons behind it.

17940,1i5hdfv,post,My son thinks he was sexually assaulted ,"My son is almost 17 and today my husband and I learned that about 18 months ago when he was 15, he believes he was assaulted.

Long story short, we were on a cruise.  He and his brother, who was 13 at the time would go to the teen club at night.  We paid for the WiFi package so they could check in with us throughout the evening, gave them a curfew, and told them to stick together.  This past summer, my oldest revealed he had drank with some girls he met on the boat.  We used it as a teaching opportunity, that 15 is too young to drink, especially in a strange place with people you barely know.  Fast forward to today and my husband saw some things that led him to believe that my son suffered some trauma while on the cruise.  We sat him down and asked him, gently, what happened and at first he did not want to talk about it.  Eventually he broke down sobbing and told us that he had 6 tequila shots and blacked out.  He’s not even sure how he got back to the room.  The next morning he woke up to snaps from the girl that he couldn’t remember in detail but that they were both naked in bed which led him to believe that she had taken advantage of his black out state and had sex with him.  There were a lot of tears and reassurances that it wasn’t his fault.  He wants to start therapy so we’ve looked into trauma therapists in our area and will be making an appointment for that and with the doctor for STD testing just in case.  We’ve also reiterated that while this is no way his fault, he needs to stay clear of alcohol until he better understands how it affects him.

My youngest was told what happened in very vague terms and he started crying over feeling guilty that he didn’t know what was going on.

He was a virgin prior to this and has told us that there’s been no other sexual encounters since with anyone.  He said that he feels ashamed of what happened and that he feels like something was taken from him because he’ll never know for sure.

So I guess I’m just looking for reassurance that we’re handling this right and to see if anyone has ever been in a similar situation as my son.  Did you go to therapy?  Did it help?

I’ve been pretty hyper sexual for most of my relationship. I’ve always been interested in BDSM and my boyfriend being rough. None of this has ever been an issue.

My boyfriend does know to some degree what happened, but not exactly. 

We were having sex tonight and it was consensually rough. Then he did something specific that gave me a flashback and I froze up and panicked, but I didn’t say anything to him because I had no idea what to say. He didn’t notice. 

Since triggers, flashbacks, etc. haven’t been an issue up to this point in the relationship, I have no idea how to bring this up to him. 

I don’t want him to start being overly easy during sex, because I still like what I like and I want to have enjoyable sex with him. But I have no idea how to tell him or what to say if this happens again. I don’t know if he’ll understand why it’s suddenly an issue, because I don’t even understand myself.

I understand your fears and concerns, but your partner seems like someone who can understand you. No matter what's going on in your relationship, communication is essential. You can try explaining the situation to him slowly. For example: ""I like our sex life, but I was a little triggered about what you did last time due to some experience i had in the past. Can we talk about it?""

I'm sure by talking, you can fix this for the better for both of you. Maybe your partner has a few things on his mind too, but he may think the same as you and be hesitant to talk.

17985,1i5kzla,post,Intrusive thoughts???,"TW: Intrusive thoughts, unhealthy relationships, rape.

Does anyone feel like they actually deserve to be hurt, sexually assaulted, or raped (especially after something that might have happened before)?

A bit of backstory: I think I might have been abused as a kid, and my therapist thinks so too, but because of other trauma I went through as a child and a semi-recent brain injury, we can’t really tell if something actually happened or if it’s just intrusive thoughts. A few years back, I was in a sexually manipulative relationship too.

Off and on throughout my life, I’ve felt like I deserve to be assaulted or raped. There have been times when I’ve put myself in risky situations, and I’m not really sure why. It’s not like a fetish or anything, it actually makes me feel sick. But it’s almost like my brain thinks my body is just meant for that? My latest ex (we're in kind of a situationship) has to stop himself because he knows I won’t say no, and I’ll just give my body to make him happy.

I have no idea what this all means. I feel so much shame and disgust even thinking about it. And I struggle to explain it well enough to bring it up with my therapist so she can at least keep it in mind until I’m ready to discuss it. I really need some advice and support because I can't talk to anyone else about this.

Thanks a ton in advance.","Intrusive thoughts??? TW: Intrusive thoughts, unhealthy relationships, rape.

 One night I came over to hangout and his friend was there as usual nothing new. We would always drink together and typically towards the end of the night me and ""my"" guy would start fooling around infront of his friend. Typically his friend would either leave the room or we would stop and go up stairs. But this particular night things were different...while me and my situationship started fooling around I started to feel hands fondeling me I was so drunk that at first I thought is was my guy but then quickly realized it was his friend . I  remember looking at my guy and him literally doing nothing I looked back at his friend and his friend just continued fondling me. I didn't freak out I didn't say stop and I went along with it. I remember thinking this is kinda messed up but something that I will never understand is why didn't I say stop? 
Things started to get strange because the guy that I was there to see and be with left me alone with his friend and went upstairs ...that's when I finally said I couldn't  do this and went up stairs to see what was going on with my guy. When I walked into his room he immediately told me that he took videos of me and essentially started  blaming me for letting his friend touch me. I asked him to delete the videos  and he said he would do it if I made him c*m. 
We still had sex that night and even cuddled. The next day when we wake up he's starts saying that it's fuxked up that I let that happen and how he didn't feel the need to say anything when his friend started joining in on the ""fun"" because obviously I'm a woman and have domain over my own body. 
He showed me what he recorded and said he deleted it ..but I really doubt it..one of the videos I saw made me realize that before this whole thing happened he started taking videos from the start. 
When he dropped me off at my house I just remember feeling completely misunderstood and like somehow I brought  it upon myself to the point where it felt like I was asking for his forgiveness. 
A few days went by and I'm processing the whole thing it was incredibly confusing and I was a complete mess. I felt completely taken advantage off but at the same time guilty for letting it happen?

I feel like i don't even have a personality I don't know if i ever developed one. I want a relationship but I don't have anything to offer besides sex. I turn away every chance at a relationship that I get and I keep putting myself in situations where I'm treated just like I was when I was a kid. It feels like an ongoing cycle and a part of me feels comfortable with that and apart of me wants more for myself I just don't think I deserve it. ,Feeling unworthy of anything good I was sexually abused between the ages of 5 and 12 by my mom's boyfriend.

18000,1i5ls0v,post,sexual dysfunction ,Hi guys i’m a 22 yr old female who was sexually assaulted at 19 and later raped by someone else within the same year. FOR YEARS after i have had the worst sexual dysfunction. Nothing works the way it used to. It’s so dry and often painful. This is effecting my self worth. i feel like less of a woman and i hate when i know the person I’m with is unsatisfied. I have talked to doctors and one doctor told me that it’ll be like that for life and just to use lube. I have tried so many different types/ brands and they all end up irritating me or getting tacky. I am feeling fucking hopeless. I’ve seen a pelvic floor therapist but that didn’t help much either. i fear i don’t have any other options and im just going to have to accept that because of what happened to me I won’t be able to have enjoyable sex again. would love any suggestions or advice :(,sexual dysfunction  Hi guys i’m a 22 yr old female who was sexually assaulted at 19 and later raped by someone else within the same year.

18004,1i5m4cv,post,Was this forced? How to communicate saying no.,"this just happened and I am trying to understand if this was an assault or I could have done better leaving the situation quickly or earlier.

I have an undiagnosis for being neurodivergent, but I feel this is not the problem. we had a couple of drinks too. I broke my month of being sober.

My communication skills are not that great but I said no several times but he kept convincing me and pressuring me to do more things and holding me tight. 

As I am writing this I feel so stupid. I could have left so many times but he kept convincing me that I liked him and even used this psychology test he saw on instagram where I placed my hand underneath his and I say a statement if it's true I would resist his pressure and if it is not true my hand would drop down from his tension. I have uncertain thoughts and feelings, ""I like him"" ""I want to kiss him"", and can't express how I felt but do know that I wanted to only be friends with him.

it was getting late so he said he wanted to talk more privately, I suggested dunkin donuts. We get our drinks. Now he wanted to go somewhere else and I thought we'd talked there. He didn't tell me where we were going next, but he was my ride back so I let him drive. He drove to his place. 

I sit on the couch. He then asks me to put music on. Ok. Then, he puts his face close to mine. I said no I don't want to kiss you. He grabs me on him and now I am straddled on his lap. I avoid his face. But I keep thinking I need him to get off me. He is still holding my torso and gets up and pins me to his bed. I am at this point mad and upset of the next things. I end of letting him kiss me which was actually hurtful like he was biting and scraping my lips. He undresses.

*At this point it just feels so rapey and lots of confusion on my end. I lie and tell him I am on my period so there is an excuse not to have sex. Is lying in anyway to get over his pleasure some form of assault? Lying about having stds, lying about I have medical problem to avoid having penetration, a tactic to avoid rape?*

I try to take control of the situation by asking him to lay down while I give him a hand job and let him finish so I could leave. But he sits up and pins me down on top of me with his legs on my hips. Repeated requests of wanting a blowjob and even pulling my hair. I kept saying no I don't want to. He makes me feel guilty and says he'd go down on me and have sex with me if I weren't on my period. I ignore the comments and say to him that I can say no, right? 

I become mute and quiet. I look at the ceiling away from his gaze.

So many thoughts of feeling used and worthless, feeling like I am trash.

I then tell myself. This is not what I fucking wanted in the first place.

I have to fight for myself, and speak up. I am better than just fucking wishing he'd finish and get it over with it. No. Fuck that. I don't want go through this again.

I sit up and he stops jerking. Move him off of me. I Get Dressed. Ready to leave. My back was facing him, but I was so pissed I could scream at 2 am. I don't care. I didn't want to have sex with you. I didn't want to kiss you. I didn't want any of this! I Breathe.

I hear him like crying, wimpering, saying I am making him the asshole now, and he didn't do anything wrong, and that he has been to always kind to me, talking to me and trying to understand me. Fuck him!","Was this forced?

When I was 16 (my birthday was the day before) I met up with who was my partner at that time for the first time. We met in internet so we were meeting in person for the first time. They were older than me, I don’t remember exactly, around 23/25 years old and they were also physically bigger. We went to my house and they started to kiss me and touch me. They took off my bra and my panties and even though I said no multiple times, they pressured me into it, saying that “we talked about this, I know you’ll like it”.

They were older than me, I don’t remember exactly, around 23/25 years old and they were also physically bigger. We went to my house and they started to kiss me and touch me. They took off my bra and my panties and even though I said no multiple times, they pressured me into it, saying that “we talked about this, I know you’ll like it”.

18028,1i5oxjb,post,My girlfriend is a survivor of potential rape.,"I just want to start off by saying I didn't know about this subreddit. Thank you to everyone who has helped countless people over the years. My online girlfriend (we have plans to meet up soon and I'm very happy about it) recently shared to me that she has committed mistakes that eat away at her everyday. I was very saddened to hear that.

She told me about the incident. I'm not going to go deep into it as I feel it is not okay to do so without asking her. I just want to be a good boyfriend (and later a husband). So first of all, she says that she was called by her friend's boyfriend to his car because it was their plan that the three of them and another friend would go to a certain place together. The boyfriend was already a friend of hers but she had never met him. She was sat down in his car and he kissed her and as she says, she was frozen with her eyes wide open in that moment. She agrees that it started of as inconsensual. She says that they didn't have sex because the guy didn't have condoms at the time. But the guy still pulled her hand to his penis and did whatever it is he wished. I do not know what happened after that as she said it was too much for her to say. I don't want her to feel any guilt. She says she feels like a ""slut"" already cuz she has had more instances like this which I do not know of yet. I want to be with her and solve her trauma and help her. But still I have this urge to ask her what happened after that.

She later clarified that at first it was non-consensual but later it became consensual (I am not sure if she was clarifying or just trying to avoid the flashbacks and I don't want her to face those). She later said that the reason she regrets ""her"" mistake (she blames herself) is because she was a homewrecker but later said that her friend broke up with the guy later sometime and that her friend didn't know of all that had occured. I am sorry if I have phrased something in a hurtful manner I am not very great with words. I don't know how to dig deeper without hurting her. I love her with my life. I am lost.","My girlfriend is a survivor of potential rape. I just want to start off by saying I didn't know about this subreddit.

18033,1i5q33u,post,Did I exhibit signs of CSA?,"Throwaway account. 

I was talking to someone and they believe I exhibited signs of CSA as a young child. I understand there is no way to definitively say without me recalling anything, but I am just curious as to what others may think. 

My brother is 10 years older than me. We have a different father. My sister is 5 years older. While growing up, my brother would quite often make inappropriate jokes (which I didn’t realize were inappropriate until I got older). He would joke about having sex with my older sister. He would comment on our bodies, about our breasts and butt sizes. He would even go as far as to touch them, but not really in an overtly sexual manner. He didn’t hide it. It was always in a “playful” sense. He would also just make other kids of sex jokes, I can’t really recall any specifics but I know it occurred. He would comment at times on my appearance, that I was beautiful or one time said I looked like a model, but those could just be normal compliments. I used to be decently close with him while younger. I have a snippet of a memory of being very young, maybe around 5 or so and going to his room to sleep with him. Which I didn’t think was unusual. I feel like that can be normal. I have a hazy memory of a lamp in his room but with something like a cloth over it to dim lights. Anyways, my mother would have him walk me to school. One day he mentioned that I couldn’t go to school by myself because “there are bad people that would hurt me and do bad things to me”, but I always thought he was just being protective. He would eventually come to me a bit physical with me. There were times he had hit me while taking me home from school because I cried that my backpack was too heavy. Keep in mind please most of these memories are from when I was quite young, around age of 6. Although I do think some of the school walk memories I have be a couple years older. 

When I was 6, I have a very distinct memory of being in bed crying hysterically because it felt like I had to pee, but I couldn’t. My mother tried to take me to go pee, but I just couldn’t. I don’t know if I actually had to pee or what. But since then I’ve had this weird anxiety thing about peeing. I will pee far too often, even when I don’t actually have to pee even as an adult. I was always terrified of sleeping by myself, which I always thought was normal for a kid. So I slept with my mother until I started sleeping with my older sister. I developed a terrible anxiety as a child, especially at night. I had these strange OCD-like behaviors. I remember I would be so worried, essentially bargaining with god to not let something terrible happen. I know it will sound strange, but I recall one time putting my hand down my pants as part of one of the ritual. I woke up with my hand still in my pants lol. I remember being around age of 6 or so and beginning to self pleasure. I have read that some kids can do this on Google but I don’t know. I had a life sized Barbie doll that I recall re-enacting sex acts with. It was essentially missionary position with the doll. I was probably around age of 6. When playing with regular Barbies I often sexualized it. The barbies having sex or even instances of rape. I was very aware to keep these sexual tendencies away from my family. I am pretty sure I knew that sex involved some form of penetration. I remember being 6-7 and asking a boy, in the middle of school to touch me in a sexual manner. And I was desperate for him to do so. I wanted him to fondle/finger me, but nothing happened because well, it was literally in the middle of class. I remember being 5-6 and I have this distinct memory of crying hysterically, feeling maybe dirty or wrong. I was wearing a princess dress that I felt awful in so I had my father remove it. 

I know this will sound, sick. But as a child I always gravitated towards topics of SA. When playing make believe with my sister I would often include storylines that contained SA or other sexual things. When I got older and began to be more exposed to SA in movies/shows, it would unfortunately arouse me and I knew I should feel ashamed by that, so I never told anyone. I have deeply suppressed that shit. 

I know there is no way to definitively say anything occurred. I’m just wondering other people’s opinions on this. I spoken with someone that finds these behaviors to be quite abnormal. ","Did I exhibit signs of CSA? Throwaway account.

18042,1i5rqaz,post,I am not sure whether to press charges against my rapist ,"
I have a big dilemma regarding pressing charges against my rapist. 
I have to leave out a few certain details in the story, in fear that it might be recognized. 

Long story short this December I was raped by someone I know. He refused to put on a condom, which resulted in me afterwards getting a really painful herpes infection, getting a yeast/infection and anal fissure from this (I was not raped in the anus) also, I got a first degree tear in my perinuem from
The rape. 
All this psychical problems have of course been really painful especially coming from a rape. 
I can not understand he could do this to me, also all the std tests I had to take, and he came inside me also without my consent, and this is a country where there is not free abortion. I just don’t understand it.. 

The thing is, now I have filed it to the police but for now I decided not to press charges against him. This is mostly due to I am in a foreign country where the prisons can be quite harsh. I feel like I am standing with a man’s life in my hands and I don’t want to ruin another man’s life. 
But I am also afraid I will regret if I didn’t press charges against him. And then I get so confused, if it was even rape, cause even though it was not consent and I did not understand what happened because it went so fast, I did not verbally say no or use force with my body to get him away. 
Maybe it’s all a big misunderstanding, it all spins around in my head, I don’t know. 

I think the consequences of this event that happened so fast in such a short time a so unfair both for me and for him if he has to sentence years for that..

He is also a human being trying to do the best he can everyday. 
Is it normal also to sympathize a lot with your rapist?
My friends and relatives are more angry with him and so binary in that he should just go to jail 



Edit: a lot of the argumentation for charges goes to that he will only pay for his actions this way and it can happen again too. But this is difficult for me, cause I am not sure I agree that rehabilitation in prison is the best way. In prison there is also a lot of rape culture, unfortunately. 
I feel like I am sending more bad things into the world by doing something bad to someone who has done someone bad to me. We already have so much violence in the world and I think he needs help..","I am not sure whether to press charges against my rapist  
I have a big dilemma regarding pressing charges against my rapist. 
I have to leave out a few certain details in the story, in fear that it might be recognized. 

Long story short this December I was raped by someone I know. He refused to put on a condom, which resulted in me afterwards getting a really painful herpes infection, getting a yeast/infection and anal fissure from this (I was not raped in the anus) also, I got a first degree tear in my perinuem from
The rape. 
All this psychical problems have of course been really painful especially coming from a rape. 
I can not understand he could do this to me, also all the std tests I had to take, and he came inside me also without my consent, and this is a country where there is not free abortion. I just don’t understand it.. 

The thing is, now I have filed it to the police but for now I decided not to press charges against him. This is mostly due to I am in a foreign country where the prisons can be quite harsh. I feel like I am standing with a man’s life in my hands and I don’t want to ruin another man’s life. 
But I am also afraid I will regret if I didn’t press charges against him. And then I get so confused, if it was even rape, cause even though it was not consent and I did not understand what happened because it went so fast, I did not verbally say no or use force with my body to get him away. 
Maybe it’s all a big misunderstanding, it all spins around in my head, I don’t know. 

I think the consequences of this event that happened so fast in such a short time a so unfair both for me and for him if he has to sentence years for that.. 

I really don’t know what to do. Everyone says I should keep pressing charges but I feel so bad putting another person into jail with these conditions. 
He is also a human being trying to do the best he can everyday.

But in my opinion if I said I wasn’t ready and lost my virginity to rape, that boundary can’t ever be taken back. Like I can’t really stand up for myself after that.

Can it still be sexual assault if I start it? I’ve started to think I might’ve been groomed by him even though we had a similar age gap

my mom went away one night and i had the house to myself. so i invited my ex over to sleep over. i found a bottle of champagne, and i basically drank the whole thing by myself. i got really drunk- almost blacked out. my memory of the whole night is really foggy but here is what i know happened: 

we had sex. it was bad for me and i didnt enjoy it. maybe because i was so drunk? i few times i pushed him away and he immediately put it back inside of me, even though i clearly didnt want to

the next day he told me to share the drinks because he barely drank any. so im assuming he was almost completely sober while i was extremely fucked up, and he knew that

was this rape? i don’t remember if i ever verbally said no but im sure my body language was screaming no, so i dont know how i think about it ","did my ex rape me  tw- involves a minor

18074,1i5wzz7,post,my father SA'd me,"
I'm 16F, and my father SA'd me in various ways between the ages of 6 - 14. When I was younger, the abuse was a lot more violent. He did a lot of sadistic things; it's part of the reason why I'm hesitant to tell anybody. For those reasons, it makes me feel like I won't be believed.

The last time he raped me was 12. From the ages of 12 - 14, there was a period in life where he'd SA me daily. I was being bullied in school, and I came home to him. I only realised it wasn't normal when I was 13. It was all I knew.

Thankfully, he hasn't done anything that bad recently. I'd consider myself safe, although he does purposely trigger me (in arguments so he'll 'win', when I make him angry, or just for his own satisfaction). 

The reason I'm posting this is because of how badly my complex PTSD is getting. I see a therapist, she knows about the CSA. But I'll not stop shaking for weeks, have constant nightmares, ect. I hope when I move out there will be less triggers, and it will begin to get better.

18092,1i5ypal,post,Idk if I was abused or not and I don’t know if it was my fault ,"
Since I was as young as 5 I was sa by two family members, one was a boy and one a girl. When I was 16 years old I got into my first abusive relationship. I was abused physically, mentally, and probably even sexually but I’m honestly not even sure. Last year I’m not sure if I was assaulted my my sisters bf’s cousin. I went over to her house and we all decided to drink and play games, but I noticed her bfs cousin kept trying to pressure me to drink. I told my sister but she just shrugged it off. Eventually all of us did get drunk but when I got to that point , I went to the guest room and closed the door and went to sleep. He came a little afterwards uninvited and I instantly went into a flight response. I don’t fully remember because I was drunk and I believe he was standing over me asking if he could lay with me until I gave in and told him he could sleep at the end of the bed only. He did and I remember being really uncomfortable but I was scared to say something so i guess I played it off like I was fine. Also I was a little drunk as well. When he finally left I called my ex and asked him to sleep otp with me because I was really scared . Fast forward to right now I just got out of a relationship and I’m not sure if it was abuse or not. We were together for a year. But before we got together, he would always try to have sex with me. Even when I would tell him numerous times I didn’t want to , he still did it anyway. It made me feel defeated and I started to think to myself maybe I do like it or want it, or maybe I’m not being as vocal and I’m giving him the wrong impression this happened a lot of times to the point I just gave up. We finally got into a relationship after all our flings so they made me feel like he was obligated to my body now. We broke up two months ago, but last night I got a little drunk and I called him and asked him if he could stay otp with me while I was driving until I made it safely home, he did. I thanked him and got off the phone once I made it home. But he then text me to ask if he could come over because he was horny. He knows that I love him and still have feelings for him so i think he plays on that. So I did tell him he could come over but I stated we could only sleep together for the night with no sex , he agreed. He comes over and he proceeds to immediately kiss all over me and while I was drunk I was still aware enough to tell him
To stop and I didn’t want to do anything. He proceeds to keep going anyway and proceeds to give me oral sex. I felt confused because I did enjoy it . But I also told him to stop before it got that far. After he gave my oral , he proceeded to take his pants off and penetrate me. I remember telling him to stop over and over because i would regret it so he didn’t penetrate me, he just proceeded to rub himself on me until he climaxed. Honestly at this point I felt like it was my fault. And it’s confusing because I do love him but I don’t know why I love him if I feel lol he doesn’t respect how I feel. I even told my family and they told me it was my fault and I need to take accountability. I just don’t even know what to feel at this point. Maybe it is my fault.

I also have a bit of trauma even though I'm not gonna talk about it here cuz this is about her. We are in an online relationship as of now and have plans to meet soon and we instantly connected and understood each other. I know it was not her fault. It cannot be her fault in such kind of a setting. I obviously feel kinda jealous about her engaging in sexual activities before me but I don't mind it that much cuz sex is not of THAT much importance to me. But the thing is I don't know what to do to help her now that she does not probably want to go thru therapy.

18097,1i5zahh,post,It all started in 7th grade and I need advice and opinions. Am I crazy?? ,"This is going back to when it all started I was in 7th grade I guess… it might be a little jumbled up so I apologize in advance.  This is going to be long bc I’m trying my best to give details and explain my very confusing experience. 

I went to school with this kid 1# (male) and we became friends, turns out he lives in my neighborhood. I think this was around 3rd grade ??? Anyways we start to hangout around the neighborhood etc. I moved schools but kept the friendship due to him being in the hood. At the new school I make friends with this other male kid 2#, he also ends up living in my neighborhood. So all three of us become close friends and it was innocent at the time. 


Fast forwards to 7th grade one day we are hanging out and kid #1 says “we should make a pact and name it, it will only include the 3 of us and no one else yada yada…” so me and kid 2# agree and kid 1# calls it the “wolf pack” so we are like bet whatever. (I ended up developing a crush with kid 1#) and I think the two of them knew it. So one day we are doing truth or dare and kid 1# dares kids 2# to flash his penis at us… so he does and I’m like covering my eyes bc I don’t wanna see that. And the kid 2# dares kid 1# to kiss me. Kid 1# does end up kissing me and I accepted it bc I liked him . I am shy, nervous but ofc excited bc my crush is “into me” so we leave it at that. We come back together the following day and kid #1 gets a little physical with the touching. He puts his hands on my chest and tries to feel me up, I go to grab his hand to stop him bc I’m nervous and shy abt my body. (I’m a preteen just starting to develop so I was very insecure) but he persists and I let it happen bc I was too nervous to say no. I leave and don’t really say much abt the experience. We meet up again a few days later (mind you kid 2# is here for all this but is kinda just in the background …just there) same thing happens between kid 1# and I but I don’t say much bc again I do like the guy but I definitely was not comfortable with all this fast moving stuff … again I’m young so idk what the hell was really happening. It starts to escalate with his forcefulness… he would come up behind me and hold my arms down so I clouldnt move or get away and he just grabs my chest and squeezes my breasts really hard. So since it was painful I start crying and trying to push him off of me. We were all in the garage when this was happening. Kid 2# just standing there like always. I go to walk away and both boys just say ” well everybody is doing this “ and I’m thinking in my head “well if everybody is doing this, then why pick me?? Why not be with a girl who finds joy in this bc I certainly was not” …. (Ill be honest some times I was ok with the touching but I think I was just getting use to the touching at that point bc it was kinda getting repetitive at this point like it would happen pretty much everytime I was with them.) anyways I started getting upset with them and they said they wouldn’t do anything to upset me, we should just hangout as friends…. Well that was a lie. Kid 1# as I am walking home decides to come up from behind me and shoves his hand down my pants to feel down there… obviously I’m super uncomfortable so I try to get him to stop bc 1. We are walking in the neighborhood where people can see this… and 2. Again not really being receptive to this what so ever. So he takes his hand out my pants and he asks to kiss me .. so I say sure but nnoo tongue … and what does he do.. shoves his whole tongue into my mouth.  Another time kid 1# put my hand on his penis and tried to make me give him a HJ while me and kid 2# were sitting on his couch. I didn’t know what to do…. I froze up and just tried to give him one but I just couldn’t bring myself to finish it.  So he stomps off into the bathroom and finishes himself. Me and kid 2# are standing there and he says “let’s make him jealous and he tells me to sit on the couch and to spread my legs open and he was holding them up int he air (basically pretending to have s%x but in a joking way) I went along with it bc I knew it would piss kid 1# off. (  we were both clothed and such) I was basically getting sexually harassed or abused for about a year. Happened on and off these type of things.

After I graduated middle school I started cutting off contact with the two of them. They one day messaged me and I was like “I don’t wanna talk o you guys do you understand what you guys had put me through” and they said “ well we were kids back then we didn’t understand what we were doing” so I responded “well then what made you stop” and they said “well you went right and started to like girls”. After that I never spoke to them again. 

But here is what they left me with after going through that traumatizing experience.  I still to this day think about what I endured, I have trouble sleeping because all I think about is these events that took place, I delt with my pain and confusion with selfharming. I became severely depressed, suicidal and had very extreme panic attacks when I was in high school bc I would get triggered. I think I ended up developing ptsd or some sort of trauma associated with what I have gone through. I hate myself for letting this happen to me, I feel disconnected with my body, I hate my body, I’m insecure, I don’t trust people due to trusting who I though were my closet friends and they wrecked me. I feel like this changed me forever. I just need advice, I feel like a fraud bc I should be able to get over this but I just can’t seem too and I’m 26 years old at this point. I’ve never really spoken about this to anyone before, when I have tried too in the past I either get dismissed abt it and told to get over it or I start to panic when I talk abt it and I shut down. I just feel crazy for feeling as badly as I do about what I went through.  If you guys need more context I’ll try explaining in responses. I really do appreciate you taking the time to read bc I just need someone to know. ","It all started in 7th grade and I need advice and opinions. Am I crazy??

18100,1i5zal9,post,Mom's boyfriend,"Hi all

I need some advice on my situation. My mom and dad are divorced. They never had a good marriage and there was always fighting. I am currently living with my mom. My mom has moved on and started dating again. She has a boyfriend that occasionally stays over for a few days of the week. Sometimes he waits for her at home while she is out running errands. 

On fridays I usually have movie nights with my friends at my house or sometimes alone. My mom's boyfriend has been very touchy with me. I dont know if its intentional. Sometimes he will put his hand around my shoulder but then squeeze my boob or move his fingers over my n-pples. The way he does it makes me question whether its accidental or intentional. He also touches my waist a lot. Sometimes he will hold my hand for a few minutes but then slowly move it over his pants. And I must admit that I dont know what to do about that, so I just keep my hand there but I can feel his p-nis underneath his jeans. 

The reason I am writing this is because this time, when I fell asleep on the couch I caught him rubbing my crotch through my pajama dress. I was too scared to move or make a scene because it was very embarrassing. So he just continued and going faster. I think I had an orgasm. I also think that he knows. He just smiled at me afterwards. So now everything is weird. Ive been avoiding him because I dont want to send the message that I want anything. I usually stay in my room now whenever he comes over. 

I also dont want to tell my mom because its the first time that she has been happy in a long time and I dont want to be the one to ruin it. I am just afraid that he is going to do more to me and I dont know how to say no to him. It feels too embarrassing. I am generally a shy person.

I also dont know how to feel because this is the first (orgasm - i think) that I have had. So I do feel guilty because why didnt I tell him no. ","Mom's boyfriend Hi all

She was a PhD candidate years ago working in a lab and her principal investigator assaulted her repeatedly.  Kissing and groping, and it was made abundantly clear on her part that it was unwelcome.

My friend does not feel comfortable taking either of these steps herself — her field is a small circle of people and the fear of reprisal is significant — and all I’m working on is her first hand account (which I trust completely) but I don’t know how much weight an outsider sending a message would hold.

18111,1i60mib,post,Was I SA’D??,"This event takes place when i was I think around ten or below ten years old. That’s why I’m so confused on whether or not I was sexually assaulted. Especially since it was my cousin who was my age. I can’t really remember everything but it’s always stuck with me. It’s probably the one thing I remeber from my childhood. He used to live with me and my family and naturally, we got close bc of the amount of time we spent together. And at some point, he introduced me to inappropriate sites. And we all know what it is. He would show me videos behind my parents back. And I don’t remember what I would think but it felt weird to watch it. Anyways, one day we are laying next to each other watching a movie and then i feel his hand under my pants. He touched my butt but I let it happen. I didn’t understand what was going on. I don’t know if I was assaulted bc one I let it happen and two he was my age. And another memory I have was when we shared a room together. It was late and he was sleeping in his bed and I was in mine. He called me over and asked me to sit on his lap. I didn’t know what was happening until he asked me to do it like in the videos. I was unsure of what he was talking about but i remember he took off his pants and was rubbing against me. Sorry if this is a weird story but I just need to know if it is sa. Is it Sa if I let it happen?  And also I think this is something he always does bc he doesn’t live with me anymore but he has brothers. His brothers live with my family and I and one day when his brothers came from his house. They were doing poses together as if they were fucking. Which was really disturbing. Watching them do that made me remember what used to happen to me. ","Was I SA’D?? This event takes place when i was I think around ten or below ten years old.

18113,1i60u2i,post,I just regained some memory of my SA @5y/o,"TW: CSA, Abortion, SW and Self-harm

I’m 31 now and just had a pregnancy scare it would’ve been partially unplanned. 
The thought of an imminent pregnancy triggered a lot of memories of when I started to play pregnant as a 5y/o and felt consciously ashamed of it. I’ve been obsessed with sex and the idea of a risky pregnancy since then and it’s definitely harmed my romantic relationships (and a few close friendships). 
When I was 18 I lied about being on BC so my fuck buddy would get me pregnant just so I could gain catharsis through the abortion (I had wished I was never born since I was very young because of abuse from other family members as well). Then when I was 19 I risked pregnancy again because my then-bf (19) insisted he was sterile from an injury. He wasn’t. I had a second abortion almost exactly a year after the first. 
I started doing SW shortly after that breakup and abortion period. SW weirdly saved me by making me get serious about using protection but there were a few times that the condom didn’t work and I prayed for the mistake to turn into pregnancy. It didnt. 

Now back to the present, after 8 months of not fkn each other, my most recent ex and I had a hookup on NYE. I’m not on the pill and he insisted we use condoms because he knew that and still I went behind his back and tried to inseminate myself with the used condom the morning after. I had early pregnancy symptoms for 10 days afterwards and felt so nervous but excited but aware that I’m fkn crazy and my body has tricked me with phantom pregnancies before. 

I spent some time meditating and review my earliest memories and I realized that my dad molested me in our first apartment in Canada (we moved away from all our family when I was 4 about to turn 5) during our first winter here….when I was completely isolated in my (and my sisters’) bedroom while the rest of the family watched a movie. 

For context on my dad: in February 2021 he confessed over a FaceTime call to my sisters and BILs and I that he had been cheating on and off on my mom (they married at 20y/o) and she had been aware of it since the same month that I was conceived (Feb ‘93). But the most recent affair had been with a young Venezuelan escort who reminded him of me 💀

I have never felt comfortable being touched by my dad and I never understood why. He smells disgusting to me and I’m repulsed by him. 
Recently I cut my hair and bangs and unintentionally I ended up looking like my 5y/o self and my dad, who recently told me how ugly my hair was (because it had colored streaks and no bangs), told me how beautiful it was. 🤮

Apart from the obsession with pregnancy, I’ve also had chronic stress symptoms like: trouble sleeping since 6y/o, nail biting, dermatillomania, TMJ, and it triggered my latent genetic PCOS. 

Idk what to do now that I have an almost complete grasp on the extent of his sexual abuse. 
I feel frozen and hopeless. I’m broken and will never achieve my dream of having a wholesome functional family. Because which guy would put up with my pathology and trauma?
I am also avoiding my mom because she chose to stay with him and because she didn’t notice the signs. 

Idk what to do. I can’t live with this. ","I just regained some memory of my SA @5y/o TW: CSA, Abortion, SW and Self-harm

I’m 31 now and just had a pregnancy scare it would’ve been partially unplanned. 
The thought of an imminent pregnancy triggered a lot of memories of when I started to play pregnant as a 5y/o and felt consciously ashamed of it. I’ve been obsessed with sex and the idea of a risky pregnancy since then and it’s definitely harmed my romantic relationships (and a few close friendships). 
When I was 18 I lied about being on BC so my fuck buddy would get me pregnant just so I could gain catharsis through the abortion (I had wished I was never born since I was very young because of abuse from other family members as well). Then when I was 19 I risked pregnancy again because my then-bf (19) insisted he was sterile from an injury. He wasn’t. I had a second abortion almost exactly a year after the first. 
I started doing SW shortly after that breakup and abortion period. SW weirdly saved me by making me get serious about using protection but there were a few times that the condom didn’t work and I prayed for the mistake to turn into pregnancy. It didnt. 

Now back to the present, after 8 months of not fkn each other, my most recent ex and I had a hookup on NYE. I’m not on the pill and he insisted we use condoms because he knew that and still I went behind his back and tried to inseminate myself with the used condom the morning after. I had early pregnancy symptoms for 10 days afterwards and felt so nervous but excited but aware that I’m fkn crazy and my body has tricked me with phantom pregnancies before.

i just moved half way across the world a month ago to live with my boyfriend. we have met in person 6 times prior, and had video called every single day since we met in january 2022.

i’m a very cuddly person and love cuddling my boyfriend. he doesn’t enjoy it as much, but puts up with it for me. cuddling often turns into sex, then he often rolls over and watches youtube after sex, and i cuddle him from behind. other times he goes from his computer, cuddles for 5 mins, initiates sex, then goes back to gaming. it did upset me a bit and i’ve talked to him about it. it fixes it for a few days, then he’s back to it. 

last night i was tired. i’ve had a lot going on since i moved here and was just wanting to lay down and relax. he was on his computer, so i knew i’d have a lot of time. he comes over to cuddle and i know it’ll mean sex soon, so i tell him that i’m really tired. he says that just cuddling is fine. 

i gave him a few pecks, and he tried to make out. he had previously told me that he can tell that i don’t know what i’m doing when we make out (he is my first everything). because of this, i tell him that i don’t want to make out as i’m tired. he keeps asking and i say “i don’t want to disappoint you”. he thought i meant that i didn’t want to disappoint him by making out badly, but i meant that i didn’t want to, but i also didn’t want to say no and upset him. i didn’t correct him as i wanted to keep cuddling

he starts caressing my bum, telling me how soft it is. i try to take the topic away from where he’s going and tell him it’s because it has very fine, fluffy hairs. he asked about where hair isn’t soft (i think he was hinting at pubic hair?) and i tell him my lower leg is prickly. he agrees, then caresses higher up my thigh. this is where he asks for sex. i say that i’m tired, but maybe later. he’s fine with this (though sounds upset) and goes back to caressing my bum. 

i roll onto my back so that he’ll stop and hopefully he will get that i don’t want sex. instead, he starts rubbing my upper thigh. i love being touched, but i know that this means he still wants sex. i repeat how tired i am. he asks “does that mean you’re too tired for sex?” i say yes, but i’ll see how i feel later. we cuddle a little longer, with his leg over mine. i can feel his hard on but i ignore it as i know that he can’t just turn it off because i said no. 

“if you’re too tired, i can do all the work. we can do doggy. i know you’ve been wanting to try that.” i give in. i had said no and avoided sex talk so many times and i knew he would not stop. we have sex, he cleans himself, i’m on my stomach with cum dripping out. we cuddle for 5 mins and then he wants to go back on his computer.

18137,1i666a8,post,I think I was assaulted but I have no one to talk to ,"I (23F) think I was assaulted last night and have no one to talk or even how to process what happened to me. I just need to open somewhere so I felt reddit might be able to help me. Last night, I went over this guy’s (23M) house. This was our third date but the second time meeting at his house. Up to this point he was very respectful. He opened doors, complimented me, etc. This past night was the same except half way through he became very sexual. First, it was making out and then he tried to progress further. I told him no and what my boundaries were and it was fine for a bit. He kept trying no matter how many times I said no. Eventually, he got me into a position where my arms were pinned back and he fingered me. At this point, I didn’t say anything or even react because I just wanted it to be over and for him to stop trying. It felt like it went on forever and I just kinda laid there after words and tired to sleep.

","I think I was assaulted but I have no one to talk to  I (23F) think I was assaulted last night and have no one to talk or even how to process what happened to me. I just need to open somewhere so I felt reddit might be able to help me. Last night, I went over this guy’s (23M) house. This was our third date but the second time meeting at his house. Up to this point he was very respectful. He opened doors, complimented me, etc. This past night was the same except half way through he became very sexual. First, it was making out and then he tried to progress further. I told him no and what my boundaries were and it was fine for a bit. He kept trying no matter how many times I said no. Eventually, he got me into a position where my arms were pinned back and he fingered me. At this point, I didn’t say anything or even react because I just wanted it to be over and for him to stop trying. It felt like it went on forever and I just kinda laid there after words and tired to sleep.

My initial comment: LGBTQ aren’t the enemy, I’d probably trust them more initially than a christian. 


His comment: i can't wait to see you get groomed by one of these guys, then drugged and raped over and over, then have an abortion because you are so irresponsible and sensitive that a belief system hurts you. 

My Response: it seems you fail to see that religion also exploits and abuses children. I am a person who has
experienced abuse from both religion and
LGBTQ but I stand by my statement. As for you ""Max"" you disgust me. Not only as a man but as a human being. the fact that you would wish Sexual Assault/Rape on someone shows me that you are part of the problem.

18165,1i68j2z,post,my moms bf is creepy towards me and I get blamed - am I being too sensitive? ,"I've been sexually harassed and assaulted on multiple occasions by classmates, cousins, and adult men when I was a minor. Instances that stick with me, for obvious reasons, are my moms boyfriend. I'm 24 and he's 53. They got together when I was 14 and I remember so clearly sitting at the park when one of his adult friends asked if I was legal. Instead of saying anything, he laughed alongside him. That was the first time I realized he saw me not as a daughter-figure, but something more mature and available. He brings up my chest and my butt whenever he wants/can. He mistakes me for my mom (even though I'm 6 inches shorter) and will slap my butt. He's made jokes about his sons having crushes on me and how it's funny. I've brought this up to my mom, but she just tells me I'm being sensitive or dramatic and that she's spoken to him about how inappropriate it all is. It doesn't stop him. He bringss these things up so casually, it makes me feel crazy for being bothered. 

Am I being too sensitive? Am I being dramatic? I'm living with them temporarily and I've had to move to my brothers old room because mine has too many bad memories attached. I burst into tears thinking about all this given all the other instances of harassment/assault. I blame myself for wearing that shirt when I was 14 and inviting that kind of attention towards my body. I think I've moved on and that it won't happen again and then as soon as I get comfortable, another joke or comment or touch happens and I'm sucked back into the cycle of self-blame. I self harm because of it and I'm getting tired of punishing myself when my mom/family has normalized his behavior. 

I've brought up those instances and others from classmates, but my family just laughs it off as nothing. I feel crazy for getting upset and uncomfortable. My (brothers) bedroom door doesn't shut properly or have a lock and the only way I can sleep properly is if it's barricaded. I don't feel comfortable in his presence, but my mom is all I have. 

It makes me feel sick and hate myself because of the way my body developed. It makes me feel like no matter what, no matter the relationship, any and every man will look at me the way he (and others) have

Edit: He was molested as a child and brings it up often. I thought I was exaggerating or making it all up because why would someone who was molested say those things about a young teenager? I know it really hurt him by the way he speaks about it, but I also know it doesn't give him the right to talk about me the way he does.

Am I being too sensitive? Am I being dramatic? I'm living with them temporarily and I've had to move to my brothers old room because mine has too many bad memories attached. I burst into tears thinking about all this given all the other instances of harassment/assault. I blame myself for wearing that shirt when I was 14 and inviting that kind of attention towards my body. I think I've moved on and that it won't happen again and then as soon as I get comfortable, another joke or comment or touch happens and I'm sucked back into the cycle of self-blame. I self harm because of it and I'm getting tired of punishing myself when my mom/family has normalized his behavior. 

I've brought up those instances and others from classmates, but my family just laughs it off as nothing. I feel crazy for getting upset and uncomfortable. My (brothers) bedroom door doesn't shut properly or have a lock and the only way I can sleep properly is if it's barricaded. I don't feel comfortable in his presence, but my mom is all I have. 

It makes me feel sick and hate myself because of the way my body developed. It makes me feel like no matter what, no matter the relationship, any and every man will look at me the way he (and others) have

Edit: He was molested as a child and brings it up often. I thought I was exaggerating or making it all up because why would someone who was molested say those things about a young teenager? I know it really hurt him by the way he speaks about it, but I also know it doesn't give him the right to talk about me the way he does.

18182,1i6a4xr,post,Was this rape or just sexual assault? or nothing? sorry if this is a stupid question. (TW: i describe what happened),"My bf (15) and i (16) were dating for around a year, never had sex. 

one day, we met up. he was drunk, i was sober. i told him i wanted to go home many times. he tripped me and i fell onto the ground. he held me down and i tried to push him off of me, he wasn’t budging. he put his fingers down my pants and up my v.

he asked me if it felt good. i felt like crying. i told him it felt great and i don’t know why. 

i was kicking him and trying to get him off of me. he still wasn’t budging. he asked me if i was ok.  said, word for word, “im better than ok” WHY DID I SAY THAT

anyways i just realized he was 16 at the time and reddit isn’t allowing me to edit :( 

anyway he kept fingering me and i was trying to move his arm and he just kept going!!!

he eventually stopped and i ran home

the next day i talked to him about it and he said it was partially my fault for hanging out with him when he was drunk and that i never said the word “stop” so he didn’t realize

im not sure if this even classifies as sexual assault. i’m 17 now and i still think about this night more often than id like and it always ends in me feeling super anxious!! also i’m dislyesic please i can’t spell it for the life of me so sorry if they’re mistakes. thank you! 

also i don’t even know if this makes sense this is so hard to type out","Was this rape or just sexual assault? or nothing? sorry if this is a stupid question. (TW: i describe what happened) My bf (15) and i (16) were dating for around a year, never had sex.

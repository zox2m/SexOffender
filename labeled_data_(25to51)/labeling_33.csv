19306,1i6wdgo,post,Afraid of binge eating,"I think I am in the early stages of beginning to have a binge eating disorder or compulsive eating disorder. 

I am not overweight, my BMI is healthy. I am certainly not in the shape I want to be in. 8 months ago I was in the best shape of my life, watching my macros and weight training. I was so impressed with myself. 

A cross country move totally derailed me and I have lacked motivation since. 

I now work from home and find myself snacking and eating and seemingly feeling hungry all day long. It's led to about 8-10lbs of weight gain which is upsetting. 

I can't find good online support because I've been scoffed at by others when I share that I am not overweight (YET!) but I do know enough to know I have an unhealthy relationship with food. 

  
I am not sure what I am looking for here but it felt good to get that off my chest. I am hoping I can work on replacing my need to constantly eat with something else like a walk around the block or something. I also feel guilty because I am worried about this solely due to weight gain...I am so afraid of gaining too much weight and I am bothered that it is such a priority for me. I would love to be free of the vanity that it seems I have when it comes to this.

19307,1i6wfju,post,I’m done with being nice.,"Not anymore. 2024 was the last year for that shit. The only person I care to be kind to at this point is me. I advocated kindness and equality and empathy for years and was treated like shit. I advocated for truth and justice and accountability, I’ve fought hard for educating yourself using credible sources, doing your own research, using critical thinking skills, etc. I fought so hard to educate people about what they’re voting for.

 I’ve been called dumb, useless, stupid wh***, I’ve been told I would amount to nothing all my life. I’ve been kicked while I’m down, then kicked harder. Was born and raised in poverty and abuse. I’ve been abused all my life by my parents, family, long term boyfriend… lost my job of 10 years to covid. Lost my entire industry to Covid. Had to restart my life multiple times, was homeless and lived in my car, had to care for my alcoholic mom who was diagnosed with cirrhosis around the clock for months. Had to clean up her piss and wonder what life must be like for a fucking normal person. Now I’m wondering when my 78 year old father will need me around the clock. I’m 33 unemployed and depressed and watching Elon Musk salute at the US presidential inauguration of convicted felon, nah. I’m no longer gonna be fucking nice. Haha. I am kind, that I cannot change about myself. I am kind at my core. But FUCK being nice.","I’m done with being nice. Not anymore. 2024 was the last year for that shit.

19309,m8fu4q7,comment,,"Are you joking? Where do you live?  I have the exact same weight and height but my boobs are 34/36C...dont consider them that small at all, never had one guy complaining..i must say i have very small waist so i tend to wear clothes that flatter my body and if i need extra voom i use some extras in my bra..this is extremely rare and only in specific dresses where i think i need the perfect sweetheart cleavage..

I have friends with big and mean big bust and dont envy them at all..may sound harsh for other girls but i see them as matronly, sort of as the  untie's with dozen of kids kinda body, the one that makes most amazing food..massive boobs dont look like implants, they sag and you cannot go anywhere without a bra..me on other hand can choose to show them off or not..when you have big boobs they are 1st thing people see and even guys that dont like you will date/sleep with someone with major tatas because of fetish, furthermore my friends complain and complain of back problems due to them..

I think you need to work on yourself esteem, stop listening to others, get rid of toxic people, get yourself nice lingerie..get different sets and some chick fillets to use in bra when you want more vavavoom..get some push ups in your life - especially ones the close at front and criss cross at back!
 
Tip: Get a superfoam push up 1 size bigger and put ""chicken fillets"" you will surprise how big they will look but by end of day you will be happy/relieved of having smaller/less heavy cleavage when you take the bra off..

There is more to life than boobs, dont fall for trap of implants - you will have to have surgery after surgery to maintain them..any more tips ask away! Wishing you the best of luck!

19312,1i6wj34,post,I was touched inapproprately and people are telling me that I overreacting to normal drunken behaviour of men,"Last Friday, I went to the English pub in Aarhus, Denmark where me and a friend usually go to and I was touched inappropriately by a Danish man as soon as I walked inside the pub. I am not doing this as to fabricate any story to generalise men or to harm men, I just want to tell my experience and what happened. There are CCTV at the pub so all of those who are going to say that it was my fault, you can stay out of this.

There was an event for internationals who live in Aarhus that night as I wanted to join as I sometimes join the pub quiz on Friday evenings at the same pub with my friend. Usually we are two girls arrive together but I had my personal things last night so I skipped the quiz and just went there to see my friends. As soon as I walked in, a Danish guy wore a grayish brown jacket sat on the second table from the entrance with his group of friends (both men and women) pulled me in and put his hand almost where my bum was and tried to put his head onto me. I was too stunt to speak and react while the friends all looked shocked and confused. When I tried to leave to find my friends, he grabbed my right hand and kissed where it was close to my wrist. 

Let me be clear, I never consented to any of this. And to those who say that why didn't I say no, I am 155cm tall (5ft1) while the average height of Danish men is 181cm tall (5ft11). I do not posses the physical strength to try to leave and when I did speak up, I was pulled back. It was out of nowhere and I was just trying to leave and find my friend. I am traumatised by  the whole interaction. It made me cry even now when I typed this out. It made me scratched my skin to the point that I almost want to bleed myself so I have new skin layer. This experience made me feel violated and disgusted with myself for something I did not consent to. I feel like my hand became contaminated or tainted in due to my light form of OCD. 

I talked to my therapist and she agreed that I can share this on Reddit so I posted about this first in the Aarhus subreddit as I feel like I need to speak up for myself and expose that specifc guy. However, the people over there told me that I overreact to drunken people behaviour which only makes it worse for me. I really need to share this experience here as I feel like I will hurt myself even more if I don't speak up and as per my agreement with my bf or he would try to hunt down the man who did this and beat him up. My bf is currently trying his best to help me in this situation to cope with this trauma. He assured me that I washed my hand enough, well he did say that was too much and it would hurt me but he tries. He also assured me that he does not see me as tainted or disgusting by that incident but it is just me feeling like I was violated. I am not saying that all Danish men or men in general are like this, my bf is Danish and most of my friends are men but there are a few terrible men out here and this is one of them.

I really need to get this off my chest because no matter how much I tried to move on, I feel like I was violated and I was told that it was my fault. When I was 6, I experienced the same thing but by two older men and after I told the elders in my family, my own grandmother looked me in the eye and said it was my fault that I was treated like that. I felt terrible back then and I'm going through the same emotions now.

To the Danish guy who grabbed me inappropriately when I just walked into the Golden Lion pub at 23:12, I don't know if you are on here but you know what you did and you knew it was wrong. Because you have the audacity to say to Sam, the bartender who I reported you, that you didn't know that ""touching a womam inappropriately who you don't know, who just walked into a pub to find her friends and not letting her leave your area"" was wrong. Do you think that I am that stupid to just accept that you ""don't know that those actions were wrong""? I am traumatised by what happened so I actually hurt myself and feel like I cannot leave my place or function normally today. All the people who saw what he did and did not say anything to your friends, your mothers must be so proud of you all.","I was touched inapproprately and people are telling me that I overreacting to normal drunken behaviour of men Last Friday, I went to the English pub in Aarhus, Denmark where me and a friend usually go to and I was touched inappropriately by a Danish man as soon as I walked inside the pub.

19316,1i6wo75,post,My boyfriend said I cheated but I don't agree,"So me and my boyfriend had issues and decided to take a break. During the break, I went on a double date with a guy I had met recently. We ended up having sex that night but his phone kept going off and he admitted it was his girlfriend. We finished and I left.

He messaged me the next day but I told him I didn't want to see him again because I didn't want to get caught up in drama. About 2 weeks later, we ran into eachother at a bar/lounge. He kept trying to talk to me and we ended up sitting in his truck while I waited for my friend to come out. I was a bit tipsy and we ended up having sex in the parking lot before my friend came out and we left.

Apparently he and the guy i hooked up with have a mutual friend who was there and saw what went on. I told him it doesn't matter because we were on a break but he says I cheated and that I'm wrong and all this stuff. 

I didn't agree and told him that what happens during a break isn't his business. I don't know, maybe I'm wrong but I've always felt a break means if you want to get back together then that door is still open. But otherwise, you are single until then.

It is something that has recently happened to me. I'm not sure what caused it, but about a year ago I surged with desire for literally anyone. I would walk down the street and look at men and wonder what they look like under their clothes, even men I don't find attractive. 

I would watch porn and it's gotten so bad that I'm bored with just normal porn now. I started looking for hardcore stuff like misogyny porn, rape kink porn, extreme BDSM. I had spent entire days just masturbating and not doing anything else that day. 

It's taking over my life, my relationships, my view of myself. 

I feel ashamed and guilty, especially because I have a partner but my partner can't keep up so I fantasize about other men. I fantasize about being assaulted so that I wouldn't feel the guilt of another man touching me but I'd get to be touched. 

I feel sick, but I don't know what to do about it. Nothing satiates me. ","I, 25f, am a nymphomanic I, 25f, am a nymphomanic and I'm ashamed.

My friend who hosts most of our get togethers says it's more fun when I show up and they're disappointed when I leave (he's a really nice guy and I sometimes think he's flattering me).

Well, one of my friends started dating a new guy. He came with us and sat there, occasionally added a few words to the conversation and sat around grinning all night. His partner (my friend) laughed at a few of my retorts. She was listening to me and another friend riff on each other, and she bent over laughing and wheezing and her boyfriend just stared straight at me, spoke up loudly and said ""you just ALWAYS have some shit to say, huh? Why do you need so much attention?""'

The party got very quiet and awkward after that, and me and the guy hosting the event went to his basement to play some video games because I felt really self conscious. He tried to make me feel better by saying that some people just don't get certain senses of humor, but my night was just ruined and I'm wary of going over there again. I left out the basement door and didn't say goodbye to anyone so I'm not sure what happened afterward, but I felt like something really changed among the group. Only the host friend has reached out to me and we've hung out a few times but both skirted the subject of what happened for the most part.

I'm scared to go to that group again and I'm miserable. I feel like I alienated myself from everyone by coming out of my shell and talking too much.

In x time we will talk again. "" But I honestly don't understand why it matters. Is it over? You won't change his mind anyway.

I dated a guy once while working at camp, but he didn't want to he exclusive, I asked, and he said he wanted to see other people too. So I went out with someone else. He then decided he wanted to be exclusive, but I didn't say yes. He gave me the ick when he wanted to be exclusive just because he didn't want me to see anyone else and that he also got very upset when i didn't want to sleep with him that night. I was pretty much over him. Don't even think we even spoke after that. He found out I hooked up with someone else that weekend and accused me of cheating. Told everyone at camp that I was a cheater, called me names, and all that. I probably should have told him to go fuck himself when he got upset with me for not wanting to sleep with him (it's 18-19 years and I still remember his face when I refused).

I should have been more honest that I didn't want to see him anymore but he made it clear that we didn't have a relationship so why would I need to break up with him? Anyway. I'm convinced I didn't cheat on him, we weren't in a committed relationship just because he told me that's what he wanted. He is probably, to this day, convinced that I did cheat on him. In the end, it doesn't matter. We are not together. I'm with someone else. My only regret is not telling him to fuck himself and leave when he tried to preassure me for sex. I wish I spoken up then but i was young and got scared when he got upset.

So who cares if you were on a break and what that ment. You are over? You don't even seem to care either way, so why care about what he thinks?

Well my thoughts are stay away from online forums —for advice that is.

Many haven’t been in your situation. 

Others hate the opposite sex which will skew their opinion. 

The past few days I’ve caroused some subs and comments sections—Reddit—fb—ig—Youtube—and in each one —they’re all full of hate and horrible advice.

If we’re in anything it’s definitely a gender war. 

This in and of itself is making everyone’s answer bias which brings me back to my point— stop asking advice in these forums.

I used to think these forums would lead to healthy conversations— nope. Just one sided answers which further exacerbate the problems men and women are having with one another.

I come from a divorced family. Happened years ago .

it shattered me and my siblings world. 

No one thinks about the kids when they go through with it. 

Just ‘I’m not happy and okay—lawyer, draw up the paperwork’ 

But from a man who was once a kid who can speak from the perspective of the child— it can take a very long time to work through.

This is what these relationships are about though—the hard work unfortunately too many are just saying bail out your happiness above everything. Well yea , if kids weren’t involved, unfortunately there are kids involved so it’s worth really considering how to go about it.

The only good thing I see is your kids are still very young so they’re not old enough to understand the implications and be affected emotionally so if you’re going to do it get off these forums, speak to your guy, tell him you’re leaving and leave 

Or.. put your big girl clothes on and stand up to the challenge. 

Don’t cheat, don’t argue, just tell him I can’t anymore like this and it’s better now while the kids are small versus when they’re in their teens and reck their life. 

And also if you do decide to leave please by all means do not keep that man’s kids from him trust me. Your problems are your problems between the two of you but neither parent should ever deprive the other of seeing their child"," Got you.

19369,1fr9w09,post,Just a small portion of my trauma filled childhood. I probably need therapy,"I 28f am a people pleasing person. I unfortunately was grapped/ s/a as a young child by a cousin.
I was singled out by him I didn't know why he always wanted to be around I was like 4 and he was like 18. I wish I could say that it was a 1 time thing but it wasn't first time was the first part and the rest was the s/a. I tried to stay away from him but you know how weirdos are they make situations to where there alone with you or in charge of you. It's hazy from the first to the second. But my dad worked to proved for my me and my 3 older siblings I have 2 older brothers and 1 older sister. Me and my oldest brother are like 5 years apart so you u understand the age gap in us. And my mom was off living her life l've never lived with her. She came in and out of my life but when I became a pre teen she was more in are lives to stay.
We use to stay at cousin moms house my dads sister (Tina) house while he worked. Tina had a husband that wasn't the dad to her kids (but there grown the cousin that s/a me let's call him jack and his sister we will call Jill) let call her husband Adam ( his real name is the name of a gun and he's Israeli) I hated Adam as well he's the type to flirt and say sexual stuff in front of a 2 year old. I was tolerating by them.
They loved my older brother poor him his mommy left and had more kids (we all have the same mom total 6 but 4 of us raised together the last 2 after me is 6 and 12 years apart) and like we all didn't have are
"" mommy "" why baby him ? Idk he's kinda mentally slow no offense he is you can tell by talking to him there screws missing. And they loved my second brother cause he was half Palestine (yes my mom cheated) and my sister cause she was the niece and then me I could never understand why they treated me the way they did. So growing up I had it rough.
I was still elm school age when one day after school I had to go to aunt Tina house everyday after school with my little cousin (Jill's son call him Tom )
Tom and me were playing running around the house and were in jacks room when Tom jumped up and ran out the room and nothing but fear came over me. I could feel the evil vibes and something told me GET OUT OF THE ROOM I saw the door closing cause Tom swung in while running out knowing l'd chase him. Well jack grabbed me and was holding me trying to move to pin me down and take my clothing off I fought trying my hardest to get out of the door and I was able to and ran so fast and stay in sight in the living room with Tom. I guess he felt so bad he told his gf about what he tried to do to me and she called me into her room a few days later to talk. Telling me he confessed and she won't tell anyone and for me to please not tell cause she had an
"" infection down south "" and couldn't fulfill his needs and he must have gotta frustrated. I was so embarrassed and believed I'd get in trouble due to many times of him threading me I said I wouldn't say nothing and she said it shouldn't happen again cause he said it wouldn’t. I can't image being in my twenties telling a literal child all this. Also they had a baby GIRL together. Well the touching continued. I was young so I'm not sure if this was before or after but he also lived at my grandmothers house were l'd often go as well and would always have me siting with him or next to him not by my choice. Even 1 time he calls me over to lay with him and her but in front of her and when I tell you he reached over her and was trying to couch me and I kept moving and she finally said what's going on?
What are you doing? And I jumped up and left cause I saw my chance too. Another time there in bed together and he calls me over and say come lay with them in bed but next to him ( and pats the bed) I'm like ummm no it's okay Brittney (that's what we will call her)is laying there and ran out of that room. Later while playing she pulls me into the bathroom and says "" I'm so proud of you for saying no maybe you should be rewarded with money or something "" like excuse me ?! Time goes on and Adam Tina's husband unfortunately to starts to also touch me and I don't think they know about each other doing it. Side note my mom took me and left me with some "" cousin"" ( older definitely in her 20s F we call Z cause she is only in this part and I don't even remember her name ) from her side of the family idk what she had to go do that she left me with her but I remember she had a friend with her another girl and both unfortunately used there tongue on me. Idk why it was only me like got damn. So 1 thanks giving we lived not far from auntie Tina house and my grandma comes to my house to visit and says she going to auntie Tina's house and asks if I wanna go l'm like no it's okay ( I developed young and was wearing a cheetah dress that I loved) and my dad is like it's okay go with her.
And cause it's my grandma I'm like okay. We get there and jack is looking at me like an obese kid who Haden had a donut in a week.
I can feel him looking at me. He says oh you wanna come wait outside with me Brittney and are daughter will be pulling up soon. Im like no I'm okay and my grandma is like it's okay go. And with the light fading out my face I get up and go outside. We are in a front yard and how NO BODY notices this man is posing me taking pics on cars and tell me to "" open my legs more "" for the pics IDK but eventually Brittney and there daughter and Brittney mom and grandma arrive (Britney doesn't drive ) and she immediately can tell he's up to know good so he tell me in my ear
""when we go inside go to the far bathroom"" I didn't want to and I still have no clue how I ended up back there with him he locks the door and start touching me and taking pics I don't have to tell the kind cause you can guess and after like what felt like forever but must have been only a few minutes Britney is banging on the door telling him to open up and that there daughter needed to pee ( she knew I was in there that's why she wanted him to open the door) the bathroom has a door that leads to the pool so he opened it pushed me out and again no one noticed cause the sliding door can see the bathroom door I walk over and knock for someone to let me in cause it's locked. They let me in and I just sadly walk over to my grandma and sit down and Brittney left her there daughter with him and came running out to the living room made eye contact with me and then turned around and went back to the bathroom. Another time auntie Tina brings me into her bed room with Adam and leans down toward me looking directly into my eyes saying "" Britney is making up lies what she saying is not true and far from the true it's a lie and that's all it will be "" I'm scared and she says "" Britney came to us and said jack is s/a you and that is not true what so ever”. I was scared and with her insisting that could never be true I just stayed quiet and said okay. Later Brittney brings me to there room (they move there again) and says that her and jack got into and argument and he grabbed her (he had a long pinky nail and it cut her )so she ran out into the living room and blurted out
""JACK IS MOLESTING OP AND TRIED TO GRAPE HER LAST YEAR"" and tells me she sure since it was a year ago it's should be no big deal now and that she shouldn't have done that out of anger. I went home that night by mom was over visiting and I was in my dads room I forgot how everything was brought up I remember thinking maybe this is my chance to tell him so when he said what are they going on about now I said Brittney said jack touches me and I don't think my dad ment anything by it and I was a kid so when he said "" oh yeah then who tf she got raising her daughter "" idk why l felt like he wouldn't believe me and him saying that I feared he wouldn't so I was like "" | know right "" and went to my room my mom kinda said the same thing. So I spent more years of being touched by both. Adam owned his own business and we were at a job site (got touch at a lot of them too) not far cause we took a golf cart there and at the job site he began to touch me and SOMEONE SAW he was homeless and it was an abandon apartment or motel building . He could tell I was very young and told Adam he was going to call the cops. Driving back Adam was like we never did anything I never touched you if you say I did I will lie and nobody will believe you and everyone will hate you. No cops ever showed up that I know of. Adam and Tina also got kicks out of making stuff up. My dad didn't let us girls go places often cause he didn't want anything to happen to us (how ironic) so 1 time he was going to let me go to a friends pool party and Adam found out I'm assuming from one of my brothers and came to my house to tell me dad I went around telling the whole school we were broke and couldn't afford a party for my sister and that one of the teacher came up to him and informed him (straight lies ) we were broke but I never went off and told anyone and definitely no teachers would approach him we walked or aunt Tina picked us up. So my dad screamed at me and I wasn't allowed to go no were. Also I would go to aunt Tina's house us 4 normally did just to get out of the house cause I for got to mention my dad other sister auntie may lived with us and would beat the living brakes off of us for any reason or if we woke her up ( she slept on a recliner in the living room and would be asleep on the afternoon she also was so wide she had to go threw doors sideways ) so we liked to be away from her. My dad worked a lot to support us and dealt with a lot cause my mom so l don't blame him for not seeing he was/is an amazing dad. But one day we were out at Sam's club and I was walking a head by a little (he was super strict but I just looking around) and he noticed people looking at me then looked at me up and down and him actually seeing me head to toe and investigating what people where looking at and said "" WTF IS THAT ON YOUR LEG? "" I look and the massive bruses and scratches and like it was nothing I said "" oh auntie may beat me with the metal side of the belt cause I woke her up from her nap when I went to use the bathroom"" and my sister pulls her pant legs up to show him she also to got beat. And he's like WTF WHY and we explain it's normal and he went home and I think we were at aunt Tina's house he told aunt may she needed to pack her shit and gtfo asap. She also was a gabbler (bingo) and would take some of his money he told her to get for milk and stuff and go use it at bingo.
Another time we are all at aunt Tina's house and idk how the conversation started but Adam's says ima be just like my mother probably have 5 baby daddy's before 18 I'll be nothing but a ""Ora"" and aunt Tina Jill my sister were all chiming in saying yeah you just going to be off having baby's with everyone I will never amount to anything other then have 5+ baby daddy's and kids all over the state. I'm still a child I'm fighting tears I'm texting my dad saying "" can you please come get me and explaining "" he comes and gets me l ball out in tears telling him what they said totally inconsolable I go to my room and I guess my dad cussed then tf out but they said I was
""being dramatic"" they were "" only joking "" and I'm being a "" baby "" about it. It sad that it sticks in my head still to this day. My sister and i also too had horrible relationship. She always wanted to compete with me and I don't even know why. She was playing that game by herself even tho I am a year and a few months younger I acted like her older sister teacher how to use a pad, how to do make up giving advice. if I had guy friends or crushes she would go and sleep with them. Very annoying. I was told she was jealous of me I don't see why cause I never tried to compete with her or flaunt any thing.
Also when I  was 12 after my sister birthday party my cousin asked if I can stay the night over there house my dad said ask my mom ( cause it was her side ) and my mom said yes and my dad turned to my mom and said "" okay her name I don't wanna hear no shit "" with a serous face I had no clue what had been brewing with the adults and behind closed doors. I went to there house we had fun and me and my younger cousin susie we alone sitting in a closet and she says "" hey can I tell you something "" I'm like sure and she like you remember joe tia Jess husband ? I'm like yeah she like well he's your real dad. I'm like excuse me what?! She like yeah your mom came over here like a week ago crying and blurted out JOES OP REAL DAD and I'm like oh okay l'm thinking she's lying but you know who came over like 30 mins later TIA JESS AND HER HUSBAND JOE. There so happy to see my he's smiling l'm kinda away from him cause when I was younger my mother told me to stay away from him never be near him and I thought cause he was a sex offender or something. So they get my number leave and later text me confessing he is my real dad and it broke me. I cried and cried for days and days I came clean to my second oldest brother cause me and him were close and he told aunt Tina. She then called me into her room and asked me if I had anything I wanted to tell her ? Cause I said no she then says my brother told her I knew and then came clean and all she said was "" well didn't you ever wonder why there was no dad on your birth certificate?? like no I never noticed ( asked my dad that night if I can see my birth certificate cause he was in his gin safe and I seen only my mothers name and I gave it back to him and just was sad and went on your birth certificate?? like no l never noticed (asked my dad that night if I can see my birth certificate cause he was in his gin safe and I seen only my mothers name and I gave it back to him and just was sad and went to cry) my brother could no longer see me like that and went to my dad while he was watching tv and looked at him and goes "" she knows "" and my dad was like who knows what ? And goes OP knows ... OP knows who her real dad is they told her. ALL HELL BROKE LOOSE MY DAD CALLED DMY MOM CUSSED HER OUT PICKED HER UP AND DROVE STRAIGHT TO TIA JESS N JOES HOUSE WITH A PEW PEW AND told him "" if you ever again come near my daughter I'll end you"" and left. I have my dad's last name I should add. I was also raised by him he knew I wasn't his when my mom got pregnant but told her he didn't care I was his. My uncle his brother even named me. I have a holiday birthday so my name is matched with that also my mom thought l'd be a boy she's bad at gender guessing.

19370,dc5ugg,post,Was a Klepto as a Kid,"Backstory: grew up poor asf. We relied on public assitance, churches for Christmas gifts/food, food banks, clothing drives, etc. Single parent household. Moved a lot, always living with relatives or weird people.

So I basically had raging Robin Hood morals as a kid, which was funny because I didn't know who the fuck that even was until a couple years ago. Anybody more wealthy than me was obviously fine losing a couple things. My best friend and I would sneak into a rich family's backyard at night and fill our backpacks with baseballs, footballs, mitts, and anything else we could find. We'd take them home, clean them up, and keep them or sell them to our friends for a dollar each. No guilt whatsoever.

Then in 6th grade I got really bad. Ma and I lived in a motel near my school and we grocery shopped at a gas station across the street. I mostly ate Ramen Noodles and cheerios out of a giant bag that we, I shit you not, got for free from a registered sex offender. My keyboarding class had a table for all our books and at the end of class, I'd stack my books onto someone's planner and take it with me. I found $30 one day and got Wendy's walking home from school and the thrill of the whole thing was amazing. I felt like a king. A sneak. Nobody could prove anything.

A year later I stole a purse during a field trip and some girl had a Kodak camera in there. 2009 was weird. My friend hid the purse in her own bag when they did locker checks and nobody ever found us. I still remember the yellow purse with white polka dots.

I slowed once I moved into dad's and he got onto me. I stole money from boyfriends, sodas from church, and mtg cards from friends, but never as bad as before. I haven't stolen anything since I needed toilet paper two years ago and grabbed it from work. I feel so bad now. Mostly, I hate that I didn't care back then. And I can never pay them back or tell them because I don't remember anyone's names from all 12 schools.

Tldr; as a kid, I thought stealing was okay because my family was poor and others had more than me. Feel horrible now.","Was a Klepto as a Kid Backstory: grew up poor asf. We relied on public assitance, churches for Christmas gifts/food, food banks, clothing drives, etc. Single parent household. Moved a lot, always living with relatives or weird people.

So I basically had raging Robin Hood morals as a kid, which was funny because I didn't know who the fuck that even was until a couple years ago. Anybody more wealthy than me was obviously fine losing a couple things. My best friend and I would sneak into a rich family's backyard at night and fill our backpacks with baseballs, footballs, mitts, and anything else we could find. We'd take them home, clean them up, and keep them or sell them to our friends for a dollar each. No guilt whatsoever.

Then in 6th grade I got really bad. Ma and I lived in a motel near my school and we grocery shopped at a gas station across the street. I mostly ate Ramen Noodles and cheerios out of a giant bag that we, I shit you not, got for free from a registered sex offender.

19372,a61eey,post,I ended a complete strangers marriage.,"This might drag on a bit and be long, i’m just bored and wanted to share. also i’m on mobile so sorry for format.  But some background info as to when this took place~ 

TL;DR at bottom

I was 16 at the time [M], I had just gotten my license the week prior and a beater car. The friend i’ll be talking about is the same age, female, and gay. I’ll be calling her G. 

So on a saturday morning I go to G’s house because we had planned to hangout and smoke weed. I pull up to her house and we end up just chilling in my car in the drive way. She lived with her grandparents and they were very lenient and didn’t care about this. We were just scrolling through facebook talking about bullshit. Suddenly behind me I heard a car pull up and the neighbor had just been dropped off by a taxi cab, she was wearing an all white scrub-like outfit and was barefoot. (I’ll be calling her S) 


After S had paid the taxi (with what seemed to be the only thing in her possession besides a key) she immediately noticed G sitting in my car with me. S comes over and starts to chat. She mentions she just got out of rehab because she had a meltdown due to her alcoholic side and She didn’t finish it or anything she just ran away. She invites us over to come hangout instead of sitting in my car so we agree and go with to do whatever she had in store. (S seemed stupid hyper and like she was on medicine) We go in through the back door and walk into the kitchen, S quickly ran to the freezer and opened it to grab a bottle of vodka with maybe a shot in it left and drinks it straight from the bottle. 

She started talking about her marriage and how she has been going through therapy because of her addiction to alcohol. S throws the empty bottle away she says “Stay here!” and runs off into her room, comes back 5 minutes later with $40 cash and asks if i could take her to the drive thru up the street. I comply because she’s mildly attractive and 16 year old me liked drinking. We go to the drive thru and she buys a fuck ass bottle of vodka and we go straight back to her house. Fast forward and we’re all sitting in her living room drinking mixed vodka/mountain dew watching a movie and talking. I was sitting on a couch right next to S and G was on the couch perpendicular to ours. G and S had been talking about makeup because something wasntpayingattention something and I hear S say “Oh wow!! how old are you now??” to G and she says “16” and then G asks her back “what about you?”   S says”im 48!”.  S asks me and I say 16. S acts shocked for some reason like she didn’t know we were just teenagers and just blurts our “Oh wow!! I thought you were wayyy older... You look like Bradly Cooper do you know that?” ((looking at me))  S then puts her hand on my leg non nonchalantly and looks at G.  “And i thought you were older because your breasts are so HUGE!” G wasn’t even offended by it and said “Ya i fuckin hate them they’re too big and ugly.” the following;

S: No! don’t say that they aren’t ugly!! 
/she set her drink down/ 

S: /takes her shirt and bra off/ these are ugly! i fucking hate them!
((nice looking))

G: /takes her shirt and bra off/ no my boobs are LITERALLY hideous!! ((they were)) 

S: Hey [my name]! what do you think? do you like them? 

she grabbed my hand and put it on her boob and moved my hand up and down. 

me: i mean ya they’re ok ((sweating))

S reaches to the left of her off the couch where a journal was open and a pen was sitting on a page, she scribbled something and ripped it off and shoved it in her pocket. 

S ended the convo and put her shirt back on and suggested we both leave. so we get up without question and start walking out through the back door. i’m walking behind G about 10 feet back and S creeped behind me and whispered “Look at this when you get rid of G” and stuck a paper into my back pocket. fast forward to me getting in my car after walking G back to her house. The note said “please come back, the backdoor is unlocked.” 

So i fucking book it back in that house fast as fuck boi and she’s sittin at the table in the kitchen. She get sup and locks the door behind me and this is what followed 

S: yknow i really shouldn’t be doing this but I cannot resist you and i really want to... My husband isn’t going to be back for a few hours..

Me: what do you plan on doing exactly?? you’re married¿

S: it’s ok i don’t fucking care



She grabbed my arm and we walked fast back to her bedroom. This fucking room made me feel some type of way because the floor was littered with her husbands clothes i mean this really be that dudes wife. my minds going fucking insane at this moment, the constant horny as fuck 16 year old me was about to pass out from anxiety i mean i’m literally about to i think have sex with this 48 year old married woman that’s drunk as shit in her bed that her husband woke up that morning in.  She pushes me onto the bed and hops on me like i was going to run away and we start making out, get naked and do the diddly do. 

I have to say this lady was the most experienced person i’ve ever been with and had to be the highlight of my life being 16. fuckin dank.

Afterwards as i’m getting dressed she’s looking out the window and the exact moment she did her husband pulled into the driveway. Like literally she opened it and by chance had seen him pull in. She yells at me telling me to hurry the fuck up and pushes me to the back door, i get through the back door the moment he opens the front and I fucking run, i did a hurdle over her fence and booked it to my car. This dude was looking outside trying to see who i was and i just drove off fast as shit.

that monday at school G and I were talking and she asked if I had went back over to S’s house after I left. I say “ya” and she said “Oh my god did you really do stuff with her??” 

Me: what? what are you talking about?? ((pretending to not have been there)) 

G: S and her husband were in their front yard screaming at the top of their lungs and S was arrested for threatening to stab him with a kitchen knife...... - I was talking to him [husband] and he said that he came home to see that his wife ran away from rehab and had another man over. he said “I know they had sex, our lube was out and the sheets had wet spots..” 

Me: oh.... ya i mean i may have went back-    -ya i really don’t know what to think about it i was just horny

S: well they were already having issues he said and that was the last time he let her over. He’s making her go stay with her mom. 




I really don’t think I should feel bad about it too much because she really pushed it on me wanting it to happen.. I’m just not sure how to feel about it but it’s far behind now so i dont care anymore. I haven’t heard about them or anything else about what happened. 

TL;DR Horny 16 year old me had sex with a alcoholic 48 year old woman in a failing marriage and her husband had seen me leave the house afterwards. They got a divorce and the lady is hopefully in a better place now.","I ended a complete strangers marriage.

I grew up with this guy... one night when I was 16, upset at being dumped by first boyfriend, he spiked my cup of tea and had sex with me.

I remember very little of what happened... fragments of me crying with him on top of me. I try and not think of it, at the time I don’t think I truly even grasped what he’d done. I just locked it away, considering how fuxked up I am now, I’m not sure that was the wisest move.

Reading that, what that other girl went through. The sheer brutality! If I had of reported him all those years ago would the same events play out? Where I live it’s almost impossible to get a rape conviction, so nobody reports any kind of assault. Seems pointless, get victimised in court, called a liar all over social media... go through all that for nothing .

Yet I can’t stop thinking about it, the remnants of the tea mug would’ve held traces of the drug still in my system... maybe that would’ve been enough? Maybe it would’ve scared him straight being sent to adult prison (he’d already done young offenders), maybe it would’ve been enough to save other women. 

Somehow I know this poor girl in the article isn’t his only victim, like I said, we don’t report over here... can’t stop thinking about how many he’s really hurt, and was I even the first? 

Never told anyone about this, too ashamed. Seeing that article... I just had to get some guilt off my chest.

19374,9pgijg,post,My life is a complete facade and nobody has a clue,"\**Throwaway account\**

So here's the deal - my life is a complete mess but no one really knows it. Here's outer vs inner me:

**Outer me:** I'm young (26), I'm a good looking guy (I get hit on and honked at when I jog and coworkers have crushes on me and other bs), I'm well-educated (graduated top in my class with distinction), have a killer job (make more than my dad did when he retired), and am charming and personable. A lot of people think the world of me and see me going far in life.

**Inner me:** I'm depressed out of my mind and suicidal, I've got cuts that I hide under my clothes on my legs / stomach / arms / waist, I don't have a single friend and spend every night and weekend alone, and I have come to despise people and what used to be my faith.

**But wait! There's more!** I was in jail for a couple days and then was on pre-trial for 2 years wondering if I'd go to jail for the remainder of my 20s. I'm now on probation as a registered sex offender and have to go to court-mandated therapy every week and have a curfew and so forth. I had an ankle bracelet on hidden underneath my dress pants at work for the first YEAR of my job and had an unbelievable amount of anxiety about it going off (it can beep and alarm). Most of my family I've kept in the dark about all of this.

**Oh!** And when my mom tells me how I'm such a handsome smart boy and that I should find a wife, surprise - I'm gay too. :D Haven't come out about that one yet either....

19375,9l1uwv,post,"[Tough Love]I was falsely accused of assault and every aspect of my life is tainted and hurts, please help me","[Tough Love] Remorse

This is a story that's affected me for 7-8 years. I'm an anxious failure and a complete mess. I'm scared to get a job, leave my house, go to school or function.

So about 7 or 8 years ago my dad received a phone call, a former friend and girl friend told the school counselor that I had ""rubbed against her"". We had a sleepover that night and I tried to hold her, we frequently cuddled so it wasn't out of the ordinary, and I went to sleep. I was 15-16. The school called the police and they called, my dad picked up and the detective informed him of what had been said. I was instructed to call the cops, when I did the cop said to me ""if I find anything I'll give you a call back"".

I never heard anything else. Not another call or word for all of these years. This call happened when I was 19.

But the fear is still there. I fear every day a warrant is out for my arrest, that I'll be driving one day, get pulled over and arrested and forced to register as a sex offender for the rest of my life. I've checked databases for my county and I don't appear as a case or have a warrant out, but my mind tells me ""it's a computer error, only when you get pulled over will you know"".

I've since considered purposely speeding or doing something to get pulled over to end this nagging fear. If I call the police station and ask if I have a warrant out they will arrest me and my whole life will end. How do I make a phone call like that? And who would believe I didn't rub against her?

I know it sounds irrational, but I'm so scared. I don't know what to do, how to feel. This anxiety has consumed and tainted so much of my life. I just want to be happy. Have a nice job, college, friends, and here I am scared to leave the house. 

I don't want to live like this anymore.","[Tough Love]I was falsely accused of assault and every aspect of my life is tainted and hurts, please help me [Tough Love] Remorse

Anyways I have recently started a new job and my first day I was instantly attracted to my coworker but I found out that he was 11 years older then me and married. So I just kind of let go of that actually happening and just admired him from affair. We working together the other day and we were not busy so we got to talking and he brought up that he and his wife are polygamous. After that I started picking up on small little advances towards me. And obviously I enjoyed it. 
Later that night after everyone had left we were talking and he said ""can I ask you a serious question? And if your answer to the question is no I will not be offended."" And I said of course. Then he asked if we could be friends with benefits, no feelings attached.
I said yes because I am lonely and sex is always nice. 
So later he asked for my phone number, did not give me his (red flag #1), told me he would call me wednesday morning and we would set something up. 
Wednesday morning, he calls me and asks to come over and I say yes. He comes over and we sit outside for a bit and he says that he is nervous because it has been a while since he has been in two relationships at the same time and I tried to ask him about it but got sidetracked. Later in our time of hanging out he says he wishes he was younger and not married so we could be together (BIG red flag #2, remember ""no feelings attached""). Once he is about to leave he says that he needs to get a burner phone so we can talk more. RED FLAG #3. 
So what I have concluded in my head is this, he and his wife are not polygamous and that he is cheating on her with me but not telling me the whole truth.

She eventually left me because she said I had become ‘emotionally abusive’ (lets ignore her physical abuse that I couldn’t do anything about) but I blame the demise of our marriage on this man.

Now the evidence didn’t add up. No sane jury would convict this man (in fact his wife seemed to have coached her daughter based on what I could see). Nevertheless I decided to make this man pay for ruining my marriage. I convinced the jury to find him guilty. The entire jury originally wanted to find him not guilty but I was relentless. I downplayed evidence that should have vindicated him, I stonewalled, I gaslit these people, etc. Until I was able to at the end convince this relatively ameteur jury to vote guilty. The man went to jail and won’t be elligible for parole until 2028 and he will have to register as a sex offender (which he kind of is-cheaters are sex offenders in my book). I feel no remorse.

19378,90veaj,post,"As a young teenager, I went beyond horny into almost sex offender.","I’ve never told a single person about who I was when I was about 13-14.  Truth is, I was almost a sex offender.  I’m not talking normal horny teenager, this went to all sorts of levels beyond that.

A bit of backstory.  At this age, I had an incredibly toxic friend group that encouraged this behavior, not to say it was their fault.  I took it upon myself to act this way even without them there.  It would have been lessened without their involvement, but I still probably would have done what I did.  This does matter, as they encouraged me to the degree I went to, and frankly without them I probably wouldn’t have changed.  Once I left this group, I looked back at everything I was and realized how fucked up my actions were.  I wouldn’t be myself without them.

With this in mind, I need to get what I did off my chest.  I essentially assaulted a close friend, and was a creep for over a year in ways I can’t truly ever forgive myself for.  I was the type who’d brush a hand on a girl’s butt by mistake, I’d look up a dress stealthily if I could, etc.  general creep behavior nobody should excuse.  It was disgusting.  However, one incident stands out above the rest.  I was playing some truth or dare game involving a close friend of mine.  She was dared to strip down for a bit.  Being my creepy self, I pushed to a new limit.  I “sneakily” took pictures.  She noticed and didn’t say a word.  I had betrayed a close friend though.  Everyone else may think she cut me off for no reason, but I know why.  I know that I did this.  I deleted the pictures within a few hours, as I came to my senses for a brief moment and realized how wrong that truly was.  I can’t forgive myself for this.  That’s a fucking sex offense right there.  We were both underage, and nobody ever received a single picture (it was not encouraged, this was of my on volition), it still hurts me to this day.  I should not forgive myself, I don’t deserve to.  I was an absolutely horrible person, so much so that I can only admit this through the anonymity of an alt account.  I’m terrified that my friends would hate me if they knew, that everyone I cared about would be disgusted by me for being this type of person.  Being like that never truly fades, even if you change.  It’s a black mark on you for anyone who knows, for good reason.  I deserve no forgiveness, but I need to come clean about the horrific person I was for an extended period of time.","As a young teenager, I went beyond horny into almost sex offender.

19379,8zjlho,post,"I went too far to prove a point, but I don’t feel bad about it.","At the age of 10, my dad had a friend at work that had a son about my age. I was starting to get into art, so the dads thought it a good idea to put us both into an art class together. We became friends, but when we hit our teenage years is when this guy got really into himself. (I am going to call him Martin just to make this easier.)
Martin would constantly talk about how bright he was, and how much better off he was because his parents were together and mine divorced when I was 8. As a perfect example: him and I were in separate karate dojos, I achieved my black belt at 11, and he would only talk about how he could kick my ass, as a brown belt, because he won about ten tournaments for kata, and I only won three for weapons. (God he lorded that over me till the last time we spoke.) 
About the age of 16, he constantly talked about how he was so smart and nobody could ever out wit him. 
Don’t get me wrong here, he was a good friend, but his ego always annoyed me.

Anyway, I had a divorce with my first wife, and I came to him for a place to stay. Martin asked his parents if I could stay a bit, knowing that his fiancé, him, and me would have to share the basement together. They were perfectly fine with it, so I stayed there for a month.
While Martin was at work, his fiancé would talk about my feelings of the recent divorce with me, and eventually we grew close, so close that she talked about his undersized man hood. (That still makes me laugh.) 
As if that didn’t explain his reasoning for being an egotistical ass at times, it turned out that his dad was a registered sex offender, and the police raided the house for a laptop filled with child pornography. (His dad was found guilt a week or two before Christmas.

Keep in mind that this kid thought himself so smart, and I was looking for a rebound for self confidence. So one Christmas Eve, I slept with his fiancé, on his bed, during a Christmas party his mom was throwing.
(Yeah, I am an asshole.)

Martin, his fiancé, and I, shortly after, got an apartment together once I got a new job. Things were fun, and his fiancé didn’t tell him a word of what happened.

In the following months, I became a big man whore. (I mean almost every day I slept with a new girl. Not bragging, just saying I probably imposed on their living space because of my insecurities.)

Martin’s fiancé broke off the engagement after the 5th month of this, and she left the apartment to him and me. 

On the seventh month, Martin finally found someone to rebound on, and made a deep connection with the first girl that would even talk to him. 
She moved in two weeks later. (This includes her dog that I was allergic to, and on top of it all, two kids from her own divorce.)

I stayed in my room and didn’t bring any women home, but after two weeks, I had enough. I put the rent check on the wall and took my name off the lease. 

Martin called me two days later to ask me what it was all about, I told him the situation, and he got angry.
At the end of the argument it resulted in me telling him “You think you’re so smart huh? Tell me, did you know I slept with your fiancé on your bed on Christmas eve?”
He hung up the phone, and that’s the last I have heard from him.

Despite the fact that he took me in when I needed help, I still felt that I had to prove to a childhood friend that he 
wasn’t as smart as he thought, and in a way, that he wasn’t better than me. (Considering all of this time he would still speak about how amazing he was.) My point to him was that we are all human, and no one should think themselves as an omnipotent being. 

Did I go too far? I think so. Was it worth it? Hell yes. Am I a monster because of my actions? This is what I am asking.

(Know that this was 10 years ago, I have already made my peace with it, and learned that I am a bipolar because of it.)

19380,8yixj9,post,I think I let a sex offender get away.,"I worked as a night manager in a hotel once.
One friday night at around 3 am I'm walking past a room when a guy opens the door, He's drunk and just wearing a towel. He says ""Hey have you seen a girl around? I need to find her."" 
""No"" I said ""What's happened?"" 
""She just left, but she left her things. She's blonde""
""Okay, I'll have a look around."" I tell him


So I do a couple of sweeps around the venue, it's important that I know who is on site, and after checkimg the guest list it turns out she's not meant to be there, so it's also my job to get her off the premises. But I can't find her.
I go back to this guys room to tell him she's not there. This time he's completely naked. And despite my efforts, he wont put on his towel.
He's completely inebriated and insists that I take all of her stuff. 
Then he starts going on about ""Hey man you gotta understand the blood wasn't my fault. You have to understand.""

""What.""
""The blood on the sheets man. It wasn't my fault.""
At this point he's being really loud and standing naked in the corridor, completely fucked so i ask him if there is anyone else with him. There isn't. Then I tell him to go to bed and we'll sort it out in the morning. 
At this stage I'm curious as to what's going on so I go to check the cctv.

Like 5 minutes before I'm doing my rounds, this chick comes bursting out of this dudes room, obviously hysterical. She runs down the corridor and tries to hide in a cleaning closet, failing that she runs upstairs probably making a lot of noise, some other woman comes out her room, and the chick basically dives into her arms. She's sobbing for about 5 minutes, before the lady walks her out of the venue, only seconds before I come around the corner.


The next day this girl comes back with her 2 friends after my shift has ended. Apparently she doesn't say a word and her 2 friends do the talking, furious they want their friends stuff back.

I confronted my boss about this, told him the full story, but he doesn't want to watch the footage. He tells me that it is none of our concern what happens within the rooms, and we cant make any assumptions, especially when his thoughts were that the girl just panicked about getting blood on the sheets, maybe she was on her period. He went on to say that at that stage the only problem was that the girl was in the venue without checking in as a guest, so legally she wasn't supposed to be there.

From a management point of view I see where he's coming from, but he never met the guy, and just his presence made me feel uneasy.
I didn't know what to do in that situation, I still dont know what I should have done, bit I feel like it shouldn't have been nothing.


TL;DR I suspect I witnessed the aftermath of a rape, but I had no proof, an subsequently did nothing.

19381,8wnp8w,post,My experience with massage parlors,"Starting with some small background, at the time I was a college student working in a part time job. I had broken up with my girlfriend recently and it had been a couple of months since I had sex. I was starting to feel super horny and I didn’t want to just masturbate again. For a college student, surprisingly I didn’t drink that much, so going to the bar scene wouldn’t really work out for me. 

I then started playing with the idea of hiring an escort or a prostitute. My broke ass couldn’t afford it, but I wanted to “browse the menu” anyway. I found myself on the Personals sections of Craigslist and saw a massage service advertisement. It said “private and sexy” so I figured it was the right one. I call the number, she quotes me for $100 for a half hour session. I ask what kind of services are provided,she says, “I do an intimate massage and if anything pops out, I’ll take care of it. I also do it while topless.”

I schedule an appointment for the following day at 2pm and I restlessly go to bed, looking forward for what’s to come. Before I start falling to sleep, then it hits me. That was too easy. Was it always this easy? I did a google maps search and looked at the street view. The place was in a corner street interserction, bright green color house, but the doors and windows were boarded up with this corrugated metal sheet. The front door had a camera pointed at the entrance and there was a metal sign that said “Upholstery Fabric Store” 

My first thoughts were, “Police sting, entrapment, jail time, sex offender list.” I also searched the local news and it said that the area had a record-breaking number of arrests from prostitution police sting operations. I immediately blocked the number and deleted the texts. I was freaking out over what I almost walked into. Even with all that, my lustful self wasn’t about to give up. 

The next question was: where can I find a genuine, decent, yet discreet establishment? It’s not like they advertise “get your sex here. Open 24/7. Walk-ins welcome.” I was on the search again when I stumbled upon Asian massage parlors. It seemed stereotypicial, but I figured I gave it a shot anyway. How did I find it? Through google searches.  

It seems laughable, but one of the way I found them was by checking their store hours. If it closes at 11pm or midnight, it’s probably a happy end parlor. Who the hell gets a massage that late? The other way is by looking at their internet reviews. All the bad reviews were made by women, while the good reviews were left by men. Coincidense? I think not. The final one was through the street view of google maps. The place I looked at wasn’t very “welcoming.” As in like, it had an open sign, yes, but it had shady curtains. Like they didn’t want people peeking in. Normal places have the lobby in full view. 

I drive up to the place and when I walk in I see an old man with a cane. The pimp perhaps? I ask for the $60 1-hour session and a lady escorts me to the room. She tells me to take off my clothes and to put a towel on. Seemed like the signs were there that I was at the right place. I put my clothes on a chair at the corner of the room. I turn on my camera and prop it against my stuff so I could record the event. Unfortunately, the lady saw the camera and used my shirt to cover it up. I ended up with one hour of pitch-black video. 

The massaging starts. It wasn’t bad, but it wasn’t that good either.  As I’m facing up sometime during the 40 minute- mark, she begins tickling me lightly. I give the biggest erection I had, but that’s all she did. I asked her if she did happy endings, but acted like she didn’t understand. This happened for about 5 more minutes and she starts shrugging her shoulders. I ask her if she was going to do anything, but doesn’t respond. I held her hand softly, but still nothing. I ended up going over the 1 hour time frame and she walks away. I end up putting on my clothes and I tip her $20. 

I go back to car and I try to process what just had happened. Looking back at that moment, she was waiting for me to start something so she could continue. Me, on the other hand was waiting for her to give the okay to start the action. I paid $80 for an okay massage. I facepalmed my sexually-fustrated self and I drive off to an ATM to get more cash. I then find another place not too far off. 

This place had the same parameters as the previous one: open late, good guy-reviews/bad women-reviews, shady looking and with closed blinds. Here I get greeted by two beautiful, young looking women and one older lady. I ask for the $60 1-hour session. Do they all have the same price, I wonder? With my luck, I end up with the older lady. She wasn’t too bad looking, but she was pushing late 40s for sure. 

The massage starts and it was pretty decent, but then she got a little rough. I’m talking about knee on the back, and bones popping everywhere. I begin to lose hope, thinking I ended up on a real massage place after all. Near the end, she kind of looks at me and nods up, like “well?” She brings one of the younger girls into the room, all while they’re talking in their language. The young lady starts lightly pushing my stomach and then raises her hand like “what are you doing?”

It finally clicked in my head that I was at the right place after all. Now I start working on my erection and I stroke my dick to get it going. It seems silly, but it’s kind of hard to get a boner quickly after being bummed out for 30 minutes. The young lady walks away and the older one begins to jerk me off. I ask her if she could use her mouth, but just shakes her head. I end up ejaculating. 

Clothes are back on and I head to the front desk for the tip. I give the older lady $20. I was at least expecting head, but whatever. I hand the money to the lady and she just looks astonished. She slowly puts the money on top of the desk and signals “4”with her fingers, all why shaking her head, going “tsk tsk”. I’m thinking either she wanted $40 or 4x that amount, $80. Now, I’m not savy with the standard, sexual service prices, but all that for a handjob? Heck no. I play dumb that I don’t have any more money and I take a peppermint from the candy tray as I’m walking out. I say thanks and head home. 

Long-ass story short: At this point I basically spent $160 and half of my day during this venture. All for a 45 second handjob and a messed up back for a week. That’s it. That’s my story. Was it a cautinary tale? Maybe. Will I do it again? Nope. Did I deserve it? Most definitely. It’s what I got for going the easy way. In the end, it’s not worth the trouble. Plus, there’s always a chance that it might be a police sting.","My experience with massage parlors Starting with some small background, at the time I was a college student working in a part time job. I had broken up with my girlfriend recently and it had been a couple of months since I had sex. I was starting to feel super horny and I didn’t want to just masturbate again. For a college student, surprisingly I didn’t drink that much, so going to the bar scene wouldn’t really work out for me. 

I then started playing with the idea of hiring an escort or a prostitute. My broke ass couldn’t afford it, but I wanted to “browse the menu” anyway. I found myself on the Personals sections of Craigslist and saw a massage service advertisement. It said “private and sexy” so I figured it was the right one. I call the number, she quotes me for $100 for a half hour session. I ask what kind of services are provided,she says, “I do an intimate massage and if anything pops out, I’ll take care of it. I also do it while topless.”

I schedule an appointment for the following day at 2pm and I restlessly go to bed, looking forward for what’s to come. Before I start falling to sleep, then it hits me. That was too easy. Was it always this easy? I did a google maps search and looked at the street view. The place was in a corner street interserction, bright green color house, but the doors and windows were boarded up with this corrugated metal sheet. The front door had a camera pointed at the entrance and there was a metal sign that said “Upholstery Fabric Store” 

My first thoughts were, “Police sting, entrapment, jail time, sex offender list.” I also searched the local news and it said that the area had a record-breaking number of arrests from prostitution police sting operations. I immediately blocked the number and deleted the texts. I was freaking out over what I almost walked into. Even with all that, my lustful self wasn’t about to give up. 

The next question was: where can I find a genuine, decent, yet discreet establishment? It’s not like they advertise “get your sex here. Open 24/7. Walk-ins welcome.” I was on the search again when I stumbled upon Asian massage parlors. It seemed stereotypicial, but I figured I gave it a shot anyway. How did I find it? Through google searches.  

It seems laughable, but one of the way I found them was by checking their store hours. If it closes at 11pm or midnight, it’s probably a happy end parlor. Who the hell gets a massage that late? The other way is by looking at their internet reviews. All the bad reviews were made by women, while the good reviews were left by men. Coincidense? I think not. The final one was through the street view of google maps. The place I looked at wasn’t very “welcoming.” As in like, it had an open sign, yes, but it had shady curtains. Like they didn’t want people peeking in. Normal places have the lobby in full view. 

I drive up to the place and when I walk in I see an old man with a cane. The pimp perhaps? I ask for the $60 1-hour session and a lady escorts me to the room. She tells me to take off my clothes and to put a towel on. Seemed like the signs were there that I was at the right place. I put my clothes on a chair at the corner of the room. I turn on my camera and prop it against my stuff so I could record the event. Unfortunately, the lady saw the camera and used my shirt to cover it up. I ended up with one hour of pitch-black video. 

The massaging starts. It wasn’t bad, but it wasn’t that good either.  As I’m facing up sometime during the 40 minute- mark, she begins tickling me lightly. I give the biggest erection I had, but that’s all she did. I asked her if she did happy endings, but acted like she didn’t understand. This happened for about 5 more minutes and she starts shrugging her shoulders. I ask her if she was going to do anything, but doesn’t respond. I held her hand softly, but still nothing. I ended up going over the 1 hour time frame and she walks away. I end up putting on my clothes and I tip her $20. 

I go back to car and I try to process what just had happened. Looking back at that moment, she was waiting for me to start something so she could continue. Me, on the other hand was waiting for her to give the okay to start the action. I paid $80 for an okay massage. I facepalmed my sexually-fustrated self and I drive off to an ATM to get more cash.

19382,8lhmsv,post,Today I just realised I abused my ex boyfriend.And that's a new low for me.,"I expect to get a lot of flak for this, but as a woman I have one incredible advantage over men that men don’t have: while it’s considered absolutely reprehensible for men to hit women, there’s no such judgment reserved for women who hit men.And I took advantage of this.

If a man slaps the shit out of his girlfriend, he’s an animal \(and I disagree with that, because it’s offensive to animals\). Just like sex offenders targeting children,**men who beat their women are disgusting human waste.** Walking garbage poisoning the gene pool. I think we can all agree on that.

But when I slapped my ex boyfriend around,it was laughable \- especially because he was two heads taller than me and close to twice as heavy.But because I was used familiar with violence it didn't fazed me.For me he was a pussy\-whipped weak coward getting his just dessert. A man getting beaten by a woman is not to be pitied. Just not man enough. A weakling. A pussy. A doormat.That's what I thought.I had no sympathy for him.

I noticed he was absolutely flabbergasted when I ran out of words during an argument and I decided to smack him in the face. What’s even worse,I glared at him defiantly, not even slightly worried about his possible response. But things didn’t go the way I thought they’d go.He glared back at me and said, *“What the fuck did you just do?”*

That wasn’t the typical scenario.He,generally  somehow accepted that I had the right to throw physical violence into a heated argument.He could see the realisation dawn in my eyes he that he wasn’t taking this lying down.

*“Who the fuck do you think you are,”* he screamed at me. *“I’m not your fucking punch bag.”*

My defence? *“You asked for it,”* I said.

*“Asked for it? Fuck you. I don’t have to take this shit.”*

What's even worse...

He walked out of my house. When he got to his home,he sent me a message telling me he was so\-so sorry and that he’d never ever scream at me again again and asked if he could please come back…

So he went back. And I told him to erase me from his memory like a bad dream.I couldn't promise him to never to hit him again ,but we had a great make\-up sex.

I have a hard time dealing with my temperament and he was a sadist \(I allowed him to choke me,slap and spank me and sometimes he took it too far\) and, so domestic life without arguments was a pipe dream.

He thought I learned my lesson... We made up again.

A month after I had slapped him, we had another heated argument.He saw the flash of calculating anger in my eyes just a moment before I tried to smack him. And almost broke my forearm when he blocked my slap with his elbow.

The silence was deafening as I realized he wasn’t going to roll over.He walked into the bedroom and packed his bag, while I glared at him silently from a corner of the room.

Without a word he walked out of the apartment, walking down the stairs while I hurled insults at his head.But he couldn’t give a fuck and called me a  *Psycho bitch.*

The story doesn’t end here \(he tried to come back **and**** apologis**e\) ,but I think I said enough.","Today I just realised I abused my ex boyfriend.And that's a new low for me.

19383,8kc8bb,post,"He spied on me, I'm depressed","So first thing is my second language is English. Sorry for the mistakes I hope everyone will understand me.



I recently broke up with my boyfriend. He have anger issues, and I had always depression since my childhood. What you need to know is I was always different from others, since it was a small town and only my mother was asian. Since I was half blood, people would always stare me, kids always treat me different from kindergarten. Even from other side of the road kids would shout to me racist things. Once I stepped on an old man's shoes accidentally when I was around 10 at a flower carnival, and he started to shout on me racist things. It's made me depressed, and my fear of people. About being depressed, my family helped to develop this by psychical and verbal abuse,  nevermind.
My boyfriend couldn't stay with me since my depression made me being addict to internet, by pc and phone. I was spending time with him less than with mobile games. Since he was my first boyfriend after 21 years, I didn't like sex so much... It was weird for me, but later I started to enjoy it. 
Which made him break up with me is I did masturbate when he was far away... I mean when he went for walk, I was bored of games so I started to watch +18 things which made me horny and he didn't come back until night so... That happened once. Other time it was he was about travel and I didn't want to have sex, I was sad and depressed of him going far away. It's made him upset. Later after he went sleep I was feeling guilty. Next day he was far away and I missed him...
These made him upset, and the fact I refused his help with my depression. First of all his help was like telling my problem to my face which made me more sad, and shouting to me when I wasn't showing him more love like he expected. I guess being asian, who have neutral face + depressed and lack of emotion because of childhood doesn't count. Well I tried my best to show my love. It didn't work out for him, saying ""You are always neutral to me, I feel always alone."". Staying on phone didn't help too... 
So we broke up. 
I was feeling heartbroken. I tried to contact him explaining everything, but it was only excuses. Depression, fear of people, abusive family. Just excuses.
 [ Instead going to get help I was always feeling like I deserve it. ]
When I was small my parents said they didn't want me. My mother was always speaking about how successful her siblings are. Head of a hospital, lawyer, etc. Then she was speaking about ""Look at my children! All my siblings are successful, doctors, lawyers, famous artists, musicians, but my children are can't even decide what they want to do in their life!? Her sister is an idiot, looks like she too"". My father didn't give s fck about everything. Brainless way agreed with everything my mom said even he one saw I asked about everything he later said to me he didn't paced attention, he don't know which lead to me to shout with my mom and I couldn't prove my right. So yeah...
My boyfriend then started writing to me horrible things after break up. 
He told me commit suicide, he wished me to be raped and never want to have sex, he wished me to be drug addict. He told me he lost time, and wants his money back.
I didn't write it, but half of the relationship he started counting money how much he spent on me with the reason ""I spent more on you. I have less money than before dating you.""
We had vacation before. I spent lot of money to get him accommodation, to see attractions in my capital, I wrote down in a list what to see, what time, where we can find it, everything,
I expected he would do the same for me. He didn't do this... Instead he wanted only show his hometown, then I should pay for everything when visiting his capital because I have DEBTS for him. That's made me sad and offended in a way, so I wasn't interested in his country anymore. I stayed in his room all day.
[Then after broke up he decided he will check my internet history.]  OH MY GOD NO.
I don't have to say I like searching for weird things. I don't have fetishes but I am a very curious person who likes to search for things someone mentioned on the internet... 
He started to question me and saying I am a freak and he is disgusted of me, and everything... Of course but he have weird fetish too, and probably his search history is worse.
Then he told me he would fuck me. I said I don't want to be his girlfriend. He said he don't want to be my boyfriend but he would use his anger on me and he would rape me...
He told me there are students outside of his window with similar features like me and he would go out to fuck them, then he would show video of fucking a girl. He would even send me a video fucking his new girlfriend when he get one.
The worse thing is I opened my heart for him, the first person I started trust enough sharing my past and I can still remember the good things he did to me, he cared about me when I was sick, he was cooking for me, and I fucked up. 
I didn't cut contact with him. He now writing to me he feel sorry for writing awful things to me, he was really angry, I should get help and after I stop using internet a lot and start healing myself, he would consider to come back to me.
I still love him. It was easier when he was cruel to me because this way I can start to hate him and move on. 
Now he writes to me like he cares about me and it's makes me feel heartbroken.

","He spied on me, I'm depressed So first thing is my second language is English. Sorry for the mistakes I hope everyone will understand me.

She told me it was to “pursue her dream job of teaching blind children to read,” and that it was also halfway between her mother’s home and one of her children’s homes (it was about five hours outside halfway from either — my first red flag, but I let it go).

Two months after she moved, she informed me she was seeing someone. I asked for more information — he lived in the town of her new home; she knew him from high school and had been chatting with him off and on over the past couple years; she really liked him and he was very nice. When I asked her what else she thought I should know of him, she changed the subject.

This wasn’t enough information for me, so I looked at her Facebook and quickly enough determined who he was. After glancing through his empty Facebook profile, I typed his name into Google — and up popped sex offender registry results. Sure enough, it was him. For child molestation. 

I confronted my family member, and she told me it was a “huge misunderstanding” and that “his daughter made it up for revenge about a cell phone” or something to that effect. Daughter had not been on my radar, which meant more digging had to be done. 

I retrieved the court records with this man’s confession (he totally did it), and gave them to my family member. I told her in no uncertain terms I didn’t like where this was going and what her relationship with this man could mean for her adult children and her possible future grandchildren. She got extremely angry, yelled at me for “invading his privacy,” and stormed off.  

Five months after that, she married him without telling anyone. Her adult children had a very similar experience (same lies, they know her new husband is a sex offender), and have cut her off almost completely, blocked her on social media, and one child has even prevented her from meeting their baby (her grandchild).

The last time I tried speaking to her about why her children don’t talk to her, she flat out denied any wrong-doing. She thinks they should love her and let her bring her new husband around them because she raised them. She literally has no concept (or won’t admit) that she was deceitful. She told me that “lies of omission”’don’t exist and that I was delusional. When I tried poking holes in her logic, she went off ad hominem and attacked me personally. I haven’t spoken to her as myself since. 

But I couldn’t stop thinking about her adult children and what they must be going through. So what did I do? I made a fake Instagram account, followed her, and made nice comments on her posts until she followed me back. I posted nice, nondescript things that I knew she would like, until she was liking every one of my posts.

Then, I started posting quotes to make her (hopefully) feel guilty. My personal favorite (so far):

“Just because something isn't a lie does not mean that it isn't deceptive. A liar knows that he is a liar, but one who speaks mere portions of truth in order to deceive is a craftsman of destruction.”

I know these probably won’t make any difference, because she seems to have made her choices and is sticking with them. But I get a lot of satisfaction knowing she (probably) reads them and that those things will remind her that she made stupid decisions and lost her entire family because of it. ","A family member unapologetically had an affair with and then married a child molester. I make fake social media accounts, “befriend her,” and then troll her with posts meant to induce guilt. A couple years back, a close family member surprised us by divorcing her spouse after 31 years of marriage and a large presence within their church (including her annual testimony about her “poor life choices previous to meeting her husband of 31 years”). As she put it, she was “just done” with the marriage.

19387,7pwn0m,post,[Remorse] When I was 13-14 I made a sexual mistake. Update of sorts...,"I'm extremely foggy on the details but I know for sure I was 13-14 years old.

If this sounds familiar, I have posted here before. Why am I posting again? I keep beating myself up, my mind keeps rehashing the details, endlessly.

I was abused a lot as kid. It's the only thing that explains why I may have did what I did, other than being stupid and young.

I am remorseful. I feel remorse constantly. Even though it was an isolated event and I never went any further I can't help but feel immeasurable amounts of guilt, and to be honest it makes me want to die.

When I was 13-14, a family member, 10-11 and I were very close. And then this stuff happened:

*She started sitting on my lap, I didn't think much of this, but she started sitting right in the center. If I moved her she would move back, it had to be right there. She would boldly do this in front of other family. Then she started this weird thing where she would grab my head and stuff my nose into her butt and tell me to sniff. I really thought these things were innocent until I started looking back, who shoves a face into private parts as a game? While we were all sleeping, I briefly went and used her hand to rub my genitals for a few. I stopped myself disgusted and never did this again. About a year later I think we were trying to sleep during a movie, and I felt my parts getting rubbed, I shifted slightly, but then she began aggressively trying to put her hands in my pants. I held them back but she kept persisting until she got in, and then I stopped her. A few visits later I vaguely remember waking up to her staring down my pants.*

Our families did find out. I was punished, her side never came out.

I just... can't stop thinking about it. So many years have passed, the two of us, even though we don't speak much can talk, we sat and talked in a room normally with our family two days ago.

These were isolated events. It wasn't a continuous thing that carried on for years, I am thankful for that.

I just keep falling back to suicide, and mourning over a life I took from myself. My friend has a cousin who's  about 27 who is a lifetime sex offender registry because he slept with a 13-16 year old at 23, I keep saying I'm just like him in my head... that I'm some sick abuser.

I hope this is my last time ever posting, I'm sorry if you're annoyed having to read my story again.","[Remorse] When I was 13-14 I made a sexual mistake. Update of sorts... I'm extremely foggy on the details but I know for sure I was 13-14 years old.

19389,7dwkpd,post,Pretty sure my father killed someone. [No regrets],"Sorry in advance since it's not my confession. Please direct me to where I should post if this is an issue. Thank you.

When I was young I remember very clearly, around the age of 8, being quickly shuffled into a bedroom along with my older sibling, by my mother who was clearly scared of whomever had just knocked at our front door. I remember being told to hide in the closet but before the door closed I saw my mother holding a gun while on the phone with my dad and I will never forget the look of fear in her eyes.

Over the next 20 or so years the incident was brought up a few times. As I got older I learned that it was a stalker who had followed my married mom from another state. To be clear: my mom never dated him, was never alone with him in any setting, and he first saw her at the office where my father worked and he was a client and it went from there. The police had gotten involved on two occasions. He was a convicted felon. This was before stalking laws, or even sex offender registries, and yes he was a convicted sexual predator. Yet nothing was done to protect my mom or her children by any authorities.

My dad died a few years ago and after some time had passed mom brought up what had happened when I was 8. She told me some background on it and then told me that some time after that she had learned that her stalker had been killed. She remembered then that my dad had been out of town and in the area of the city where her stalker was killed at the same time he was killed. She told me she never brought it up to my dad. I looked at her with a bewildered face and said directly “Are you trying to tell me that dad killed somebody?” and without hesitating she said “Yes”. 

After a few moments of shock and trying to wrap my head around it we talked about it some more. I was not 100% convinced but I was close. 

Fast forward about a year and I was hanging out with my dad’s childhood/lifetime friend who just passed recently and I brought it up. The look on his face told me everything. He said, “If your father did what you think he did I can tell you that he did it because he felt he was protecting his family. Your father’s entire life was about you, your mom, and your ____ (sibling won’t say brother or sister trying to not be too detailed). Do me a favor _____ (my name) and don’t be cavalier about discussing this. There could be people alive who might’ve played a role and this could hurt them.”

That was that. Not exactly beyond a shadow of a doubt but I believe it. 

Final context: My upbringing was as Ozzie and Harriet as you could get. It is exactly the childhood and privilege that all parents want for their kids. Middle class, safe neighborhood in the suburbs, and all the normalcy in the world. I have never seen my father be violent, he never spanked us, and he worshiped the ground my mother walked on. I’m very very proud of my father.","Pretty sure my father killed someone. [No regrets] Sorry in advance since it's not my confession. Please direct me to where I should post if this is an issue.

Way more shit than any sane person would have stuck around for. I gave him a second chance, he got his shit together, but I think by that point enough damage had been done that I was going to be able to recover. I think I kicked it all of by slowly withdrawing without even realizing it, but that definitely doesn't excuse any of his behavior over the past year.

He's a mess of a person. He forgets everything, makes poor choices, and I pretty much have to hold his hand through everything. I think I'm suffering from a massive of case of caregiver burnout. It's like I have three kids instead of two. 

We never have sex and I am more than fine with that. After I had our second child, I went had really bad PPD. I kept all the weight I'd gained while pregnant and gained some more. Since then, I've lost some of it. I used to be extremely skinny and I was, admittedly, very attractive. After my weight gain, he took to making really harsh comments about how I was(am) fat. He does it under the guise of joking, but he did it daily, several times a day. He himself is overweight. He's been overweight almost our entire relationship and I've never judged him for it and I'd always made sure to let him know I found him attractive. When I confronted him about how he was being mean, he said I'd done the same to him, but could actually come up with a time I'd ever said anything. I know I haven't because I never make fun of people for how much they weigh. SSeeing as my self-esteem was low to begin with due to depression and my own negative self-image, I don't want to fuck him. Why would I want to sleep with someone who calls me fat regularly? Also, he's the most vanilla person I know. It's PIV and that's it. I need more than that and always have.

He's also taking to asking me things like ""If I said I wanted to date some hot chick I met at the store, what would you say?"" He's been doing this for several months. I'm 100% sure he's trying to see if I'd be cool with him fucking someone else. Honestly, I wouldn't care and he gets offended if I don't immediately freak out and get angry. But if I do get angry (it's annoying how much he pulls this shit) then he yells at me for not being able to take a joke. 

He's irresponsible financially and because of this and my having had to walk him through everything, our lives have been nearly destroyed. Right now, we're fighting just to keep the kids on the right track. Once we've got that set and I can get a job with a decent enough wage to start setting some money aside for myself, I'm fucking out. He's always threatening he wants to take the kids, that I'm a terrible mother, and he's started telling the kids I'm worthless. I'd leave now, but I'm legitimately stuck. I don't have anywhere I can really go.

19393,65s1oy,post,I'm Living A Lie,"[Conflicted]
When I was younger I was a very emotional child. I often felt sadness and remorse at the drop of a hat; for example I had a difficult time doing volunteer work because it would emotionally devastate me to the point of exhaustion and I refused to watch Disney movies because the sad part in the beginning would make my chest ache so much that it just wasn't worth waiting for things to get better. I cried myself to sleep almost every night from ages 8-12 out of fear of dying, specifically from ""global warming""; I was afraid I would be the only person left alive on earth because global warming killed everyone else. I was never an angry kid, I can only recall throwing a temper tantrum once around age 5 or 6 although I cannot remember the reason, just that I cried until I exhausted myself. As a kid, interacting with other kids was really hard for me. I was very anxious and talking to others worsened this so I tried to avoid it as much as possible. I was always quiet, and in elementary school I always assumed my ""friends"" were only friends with me because they wanted something from me. I never invited kids over to play because I preferred to be alone. I would also refuse gifts from others for years and hated that my parents spent money on me to feed me and as a result, was constantly nagged by guilt. This was unnecessary, as I have always been comfortably middle class, even upper middle class in the more recent years. 

I had a hard time in middle school trying to cope with what would later be diagnosed as depression and borderline personality disorder. It got to the point where I decided it was better not to feel anything at all than to feel the pain I felt everyday just by existing. So I started just repressing it. I desperately wanted to die, was constantly self harming one way or another (starving myself as punishment for what I thought were ""bad"" grades, cutting myself open during a psychotic episode, drinking myself into a stupor, etc) and became very disconnected with my body. There is still rarely a day in which I look in the mirror and recognize the person looking back at me. The only way I could cope with this in middle school was to ""mentally check out"" which I would later be told was dissociation. 

By the end of high school things had gotten much better. I was medicated for a short while, but things were improving quickly on their own so my doctors found it unnecessary. I was finally feeling things again for the first time in years; save when I felt ""happy"" during manic episodes, I didn't feel like I really experienced emotions throughout middle school and early high school. But in late high school my passions returned and I was motivated. 

Now I am in college and although my depression and bpd is virtually nonexistent at this point I noticed recently that in the past year or so I have gradually stopped feeling again. Besides some basic desires (hunger, drugs (not as in addiction though, some weekends I want to smoke a bowl, and at this point wanting anything is a surprise)) I have a hard time feeling things. I don't have a sex drive unless I'm alone, and I never fantasize about actual people. I don't think I can love. It's not that I completely don't care about the people in my life; I would certainly miss my friends and my father if they were to die, however I cannot see myself being all that broken up about it. The way I see it, people die, there's nothing we can do about it, and there are thousands of other people in the world to become friends with. I've never been able to maintain a relationship more than 3 weeks, I am a serial cheater (something no one in my life knows about) and I am by far the most secretive person I know. I often live double-lives, keeping the different ""parts"" of my life very separated. I steal from friends and family without remorse, however I only allow myself to steal from the people who I believe deserve it. The only thing that guides my life is a moral compass I have ""taught"" myself: I only steal from people who I think ""deserve"" it, I am almost never rude to others, I smile when it's appropriate, I have manners, etc. 

Something inside me feels like I did this to myself. I couldn't cope with things as a kid and so I just decided not to feel instead. Now I can't feel even when I want to. I feel like I'm lying to everyone in my life because on the outside, I'm a functioning adult. I go to college and always makes the deans list, have a summer job working with kids at an educational camp, I look happy most of the time and come off as extremely charming to others; my friends constantly praise my ability to get along with people, even people who otherwise hate ""people like me"" (I'm transgender yet I have many ""friends"" who love spending time with me even though they hate my identity and would normally refuse to be friends with lgbt people).

When I was younger I was a very emotional child. I often felt sadness and remorse at the drop of a hat; for example I had a difficult time doing volunteer work because it would emotionally devastate me to the point of exhaustion and I refused to watch Disney movies because the sad part in the beginning would make my chest ache so much that it just wasn't worth waiting for things to get better. I cried myself to sleep almost every night from ages 8-12 out of fear of dying, specifically from ""global warming""; I was afraid I would be the only person left alive on earth because global warming killed everyone else. I was never an angry kid, I can only recall throwing a temper tantrum once around age 5 or 6 although I cannot remember the reason, just that I cried until I exhausted myself. As a kid, interacting with other kids was really hard for me. I was very anxious and talking to others worsened this so I tried to avoid it as much as possible. I was always quiet, and in elementary school I always assumed my ""friends"" were only friends with me because they wanted something from me. I never invited kids over to play because I preferred to be alone. I would also refuse gifts from others for years and hated that my parents spent money on me to feed me and as a result, was constantly nagged by guilt. This was unnecessary, as I have always been comfortably middle class, even upper middle class in the more recent years. 

I had a hard time in middle school trying to cope with what would later be diagnosed as depression and borderline personality disorder. It got to the point where I decided it was better not to feel anything at all than to feel the pain I felt everyday just by existing. So I started just repressing it. I desperately wanted to die, was constantly self harming one way or another (starving myself as punishment for what I thought were ""bad"" grades, cutting myself open during a psychotic episode, drinking myself into a stupor, etc) and became very disconnected with my body. There is still rarely a day in which I look in the mirror and recognize the person looking back at me. The only way I could cope with this in middle school was to ""mentally check out"" which I would later be told was dissociation. 

By the end of high school things had gotten much better. I was medicated for a short while, but things were improving quickly on their own so my doctors found it unnecessary. I was finally feeling things again for the first time in years; save when I felt ""happy"" during manic episodes, I didn't feel like I really experienced emotions throughout middle school and early high school. But in late high school my passions returned and I was motivated. 

Now I am in college and although my depression and bpd is virtually nonexistent at this point I noticed recently that in the past year or so I have gradually stopped feeling again. Besides some basic desires (hunger, drugs (not as in addiction though, some weekends I want to smoke a bowl, and at this point wanting anything is a surprise)) I have a hard time feeling things. I don't have a sex drive unless I'm alone, and I never fantasize about actual people. I don't think I can love. It's not that I completely don't care about the people in my life; I would certainly miss my friends and my father if they were to die, however I cannot see myself being all that broken up about it. The way I see it, people die, there's nothing we can do about it, and there are thousands of other people in the world to become friends with. I've never been able to maintain a relationship more than 3 weeks, I am a serial cheater (something no one in my life knows about) and I am by far the most secretive person I know. I often live double-lives, keeping the different ""parts"" of my life very separated. I steal from friends and family without remorse, however I only allow myself to steal from the people who I believe deserve it. The only thing that guides my life is a moral compass I have ""taught"" myself: I only steal from people who I think ""deserve"" it, I am almost never rude to others, I smile when it's appropriate, I have manners, etc. 

Something inside me feels like I did this to myself. I couldn't cope with things as a kid and so I just decided not to feel instead. Now I can't feel even when I want to. I feel like I'm lying to everyone in my life because on the outside, I'm a functioning adult. I go to college and always makes the deans list, have a summer job working with kids at an educational camp, I look happy most of the time and come off as extremely charming to others; my friends constantly praise my ability to get along with people, even people who otherwise hate ""people like me"" (I'm transgender yet I have many ""friends"" who love spending time with me even though they hate my identity and would normally refuse to be friends with lgbt people). I've never considered telling the people in my life about this because I know they would be offended and I feel like once I reveal this part of my life there is no going back. I plan on continuing to live this lie until I die even though I know that being a liar is not ""good"". However, I do not feel guilty.

19397,5uebrr,post,"[Remorse] I need help re: sexual abuse, assault, and rape.","[Support only] [Remorse] [Heavy] [Graphic] 
I'm new to Reddit so I'm sorry if I seem like a noob. I'm only posting this here because I'm not sure where else to turn. Basically I am going to write out are a few incidents from my life, and you will probably see why they are conflicting and I feel confused. I know the best option would be to tell my therapist but I am afraid that I will lose my job... Again you'll see what I'm talking about soon. You should know that I am female and in my twenties, and that these stories are in chronological-ish order. 

Okay. So my first memory of sexual assault/molestation was not really anything direct but I had this friend all through grade school who was always really weird and ended up being suicidal in middle school, etc. (I'm not trying to downplay that because I am and I get mental health struggles but that's just a huge side note). Not your run of the mill person. Anyways, I remember on a couple occasions we would play in the snow outside as kids (I don't have a concept of how old I was but I was definitely less than 8 or 9) and she would have my lay down in the snow and she would pile snow on my chest area and my private area and then pat it down which really made me uncomfortable. She would always say something like she was making me into a mermaid but now when I think of it I remember how uncomfortable I was. That's kind of a short story and because it's so far back in my memories I can't really remember all the details or come up with any concrete evidence. 

Story number two: just a detail, NOT non-consensual anything. My best friend and I used to make out all the time in grade 4, and I distinctly remember it was because we wanted to practice kissing and were curious. Both of us were very okay with it and we got touchy feely with each other but it would always stop and then we'd just go to sleep. Everything seemed normal.

Story number three: another detail. At some point when I was around 10 - 12 (!?) I somehow discovered pornography on the internet and I knowingly became addicted to it for a while before I realized what was happening and then tried to stop (after a while I was successful). This was very unusual for me--I was really the model responsible older sibling, girl-next-door type. 

Story number four... I have a kid brother and we used to like to have sleep overs with each other which was never anything sexual. My family is just generally touchy and we like to snuggle. This was around the time I discovered the pornography. On one specific night sometime when he must have been around 2 years old or so, my sexual curiosity (or whatever the fuck was/is/was (????) wrong with me) led me to mess around with him by touching his penis and beginning to engage in oral but then I remember thinking ""what the fuck am I doing???"" and then I stopped. I felt icky and gross and when I think about it now I feel icky and gross. He was so little I honestly don't know or don't think he remembers this at all. I wasn't thinking at all when I was doing it and I was somehow dissociating. I'm really afraid that one day he will remember and he will hate me for it (he and I are very close to this day) or that it will have longterm effects on his quality of life and mental health. The other issue with this situation is that currently my career revolves around working with children. I am scared that if I tell my therapist about this, she will have to tell someone and I won't get approved for my mandatory police checks. To make it ABSOLUTELY CLEAR, I do NOT have sexual thoughts or desires or ANYTHING for children or minors or anything. This incident with my brother happened ONCE and I believe it was due to his innocence and my curiosity, NOT because he was underage or anything like that. I KNOW it was wrong. I knew that right after I did it. I feel horrible about it and I can't erase it from my memory. I don't know what got into me or what was wrong with me as a child that led to this happening, but something was and there's no taking back what happened. 

Story number five... I had a friend in middle school who I would have sleep overs with and we did some kissing on our sleepovers but nothing like the friend in grade 4. It quickly ended. One night I recall wanting to make out with her but I was afraid to express my feelings so I tried to cuddle up to her once we had turned out the lights, etc. and put my hand on her hip and tried to kiss her but then nothing happened so I just rolled back over and tried to go to sleep. I am fairly certain she was in shock and just pretended to be asleep and I have reason to believe that she remembers that to this day. She told everyone at school that I was a lesbian and I was bullied for that (fair enough). Again, I feel very remorseful about this now. I wish I could take that back, I don't know what was wrong with me, I don't know what I was thinking in that moment. As with most instances like these, I am almost certain that she remembers. It is killing me to know that I potentially have had a longterm effect on someone's self confidence and mental health and future sexual experiences. We haven't really talked since that day. 

Interjection - over time I forgot about these instances, pushing them to the very back of my brain because, despite being the violator (in the case of my stories 4/5), it did cause me some sort of irreparable trauma. I did not start to remember them until about a year ago. 

Story number six... I was victim to statutory rape when I was 14 or 15. Basically I was very naive and allowed someone who had just turned 18 to seduce me and convince me to meet up with him in dark school hallways after hours to make out, etc. Up until this point any male attention I had received was from guys telling me that I was fat or stupid or gross. Then, having this older and very attractive person show his attraction and compliment me in these ways was a novelty. I couldn't believe that someone would ever think of me in that way. The first time we met (before we had actually been introduced) he came up behind me and wrapped his hands around my waist. Now I recognize that his actions were completely abnormal. The first time we kissed (also my first kiss), he brought me into a dark hallway telling me he'd buy me a can of pop, which he did but then he set it down and I asked him what he was doing, and he pinned me to the wall and started to make out with me and feel me up. I should clarify that this man was very very strong as he was a gymnast and I certainly was not. He was able to hold both my arms down with one hand. On one hand in my head this was logically what any girl could dream of, on the other my gut feeling was telling me to run. I was in shock and did nothing. I stupidly agreed to meet with him again and again wherein similar things would happen until one day he forced me give him oral and then proceeded to have sex with me but I froze up because it was my first time and I didn't know what to do. I feel like part of this whole thing was my fault for never saying ""stop"" or ""no"" but also because he had no reason to believe that I wasn't into it... Also the icing on the cake was that I found out the day he met me was the day after his girlfriend had dumped him and she went to the same school so basically I was unknowingly his rebound and arm candy. 

Story number seven... The last story basically led to a downwards spiral in me believing that (1) sexual favours and acts were the only way to ever achieve any level of intimacy with someone and that (2) my role as a sexual object was the only value that men would see in me. While I had a lot of ""consensual"" sex (I'll do it because I know you will like me if I do) throughout the remainder of high school and at the beginning of university, I was not 'actually' sexually assaulted until I was in my first long term relationship. Basically I started seeing this guy right after I started university and this led to us finally moving in together after only a few months of dating and then a common law marriage for several years. At first, I was really turned on by him and we had a lot of very good consensual sex. I'm not exactly sure where the turning point was, but about halfway through our relationship I stopped wanting to have sex with him all the time. Both he and I interpreted this as me being unfaithful or me being lazy or me not wanting to hold up ""my end"" of the relationship. Note: if you are with the right person or a respectful human being at all, sex doesn't need to be a tit for tat situation. Anyhow, no matter what the excuse, it had something to do with what was wrong with ME, and never anything about him or us. I realize now that it was probably because he was very manipulative and controlling and emotionally abusive, which caused me to fall out of love with him and thus no longer be sexually attracted to him simply as part of my innate reaction. Then there was a definite turning point. One morning he tried to wake me up with sex. I am very grumpy in the morning. I didn't want to do anything and he took great personal offence to it. We went on with our day but he brought it up later and we had a giant fight about it. Basically I finally gave in and said fine, have sex with me then, so he did but basically I just felt dead inside the whole time. From then on, whenever he wanted to have sex I would just go along with the motions and just feel dead inside. I would dissociate and think of anything besides what was happening to me physically and he would just get off and then I'd go on with my day as though nothing had happened. This happened for a long time before I realized the relationship wasn't healthy and I left. I hadn't left before because he was suicidal and every time our relationship grew thin he would threaten to kill himself or say he wouldn't survive without me. You can see why I couldn't just walk away.

Story number eight... After this relationship I had a lot of tinder sex with similar circumstances; I would use it as a way to get men to like me because I felt there was nothing else they could possibly want me for. Because of this a lot of the instances were barely consensual. However, there was one that was 100% not consensual and was most DEFINITELY rape. I met this guy, he was really really nice and normal and we were getting along really well. We went for coffee and even the barista said we were cute together. Then we went for dinner because we spent so long talking we skipped dinner... He was respectful of my eating habits and food choices and we talked more and more. Finally it came time to bid our goodbyes and he offered me a ride home. I took the ride and when he got to my place he parked and kind of made it clear that he wanted to come in. I'm a pushover so I didn't bat an eye despite knowing exactly where this was going. Now, you must know that this came at a time that I had started to be ok with being single and started to see my dating patterns and how it was harmful. I had decided that I didn't want any more hookups but that I wanted to keep dating people. I figured this would weed out the assholes from the good people based on who would or wouldn't wait for me. Anyways, he came into my place and we chatted for a while and started watching a movie (I can't even remember which one) and then we started kissing and I stopped and told him that I didn't want to go any further. I explained my situation fairly clearly. He kept saying things like ""oh come on, you know you want to,"" etc. I got up and went to the washroom because I was angry. I stood in there for a while with the door closed because I didn't know what to do. I was trying to decide if I'd just let him do it and get it over with (sad but true) or if I'd shut it down. I came back out and he was in my bedroom. He put his arms around me and I told him again what I had said before. When I looked up at him (he was quite tall) he grabbed my face and started making out with me. He forced his disgusting tongue in my mouth and then shoved me onto the bed and started to do everything else that I can barely bring myself to type let alone think. Anyways basically it was very very very rough. It was very painful. I froze up again and did nothing, I just let him flop me around like a rag doll. I had some cuts the next day from where he had pulled at my skin and it broke because of the pressure. I also had bruises. What hurt me the most was that it was the first time I had the bravery to say no and it didn't work. This was in September or October. It is now February. 
Something very similar happened again a few weeks later with a different guy but it wasn't as bad and he could tell something was wrong because it was the first time since that time (^) and I started shaking halfway through and going into shock. He didn't have bad intentions. He was just naive. When I started shaking he stopped. 



What kills me the most about all of this is that I know I have inflicted the feelings I had on many occasions upon two other human beings. Has anyone else out there been abused but also the abuser? How do I understand these things in my adult consciousness when I know they happened as a child? How do I tell my brother? Do I ever tell him? What if I lose my job? This is my entire career that I have worked very hard to build and love with all my heart. I would have to start from ground zero for something that happened when I was a child myself and which I have NO residual desires or ANYTHING of the sort from. Can anyone offer any advice? Do you know about any laws regarding being an underage offender and what your rights are as an adult? I do not pose any threat to a child. I know that for myself. :'( I feel like that was an entirely different person from who I am now. It is more of a vignette in my mind than a memory. I am in shock and disbelief about my own actions. 

Also how do you guys (rape/sexual abuse victims) deal with instances such as those where there was never any official saying ""no"" or ""stop""? Does this still count as rape? Sigh. :/// ","[Remorse] I need help re: sexual abuse, assault, and rape. [Support only] [Remorse] [Heavy] [Graphic]

I stupidly agreed to meet with him again and again wherein similar things would happen until one day he forced me give him oral and then proceeded to have sex with me but I froze up because it was my first time and I didn't know what to do. I feel like part of this whole thing was my fault for never saying ""stop"" or ""no"" but also because he had no reason to believe that I wasn't into it... Also the icing on the cake was that I found out the day he met me was the day after his girlfriend had dumped him and she went to the same school so basically I was unknowingly his rebound and arm candy. 

Story number seven... The last story basically led to a downwards spiral in me believing that (1) sexual favours and acts were the only way to ever achieve any level of intimacy with someone and that (2) my role as a sexual object was the only value that men would see in me. While I had a lot of ""consensual"" sex (I'll do it because I know you will like me if I do) throughout the remainder of high school and at the beginning of university, I was not 'actually' sexually assaulted until I was in my first long term relationship. Basically I started seeing this guy right after I started university and this led to us finally moving in together after only a few months of dating and then a common law marriage for several years. At first, I was really turned on by him and we had a lot of very good consensual sex. I'm not exactly sure where the turning point was, but about halfway through our relationship I stopped wanting to have sex with him all the time. Both he and I interpreted this as me being unfaithful or me being lazy or me not wanting to hold up ""my end"" of the relationship. Note: if you are with the right person or a respectful human being at all, sex doesn't need to be a tit for tat situation. Anyhow, no matter what the excuse, it had something to do with what was wrong with ME, and never anything about him or us. I realize now that it was probably because he was very manipulative and controlling and emotionally abusive, which caused me to fall out of love with him and thus no longer be sexually attracted to him simply as part of my innate reaction. Then there was a definite turning point. One morning he tried to wake me up with sex. I am very grumpy in the morning. I didn't want to do anything and he took great personal offence to it. We went on with our day but he brought it up later and we had a giant fight about it. Basically I finally gave in and said fine, have sex with me then, so he did but basically I just felt dead inside the whole time. From then on, whenever he wanted to have sex I would just go along with the motions and just feel dead inside. I would dissociate and think of anything besides what was happening to me physically and he would just get off and then I'd go on with my day as though nothing had happened. This happened for a long time before I realized the relationship wasn't healthy and I left. I hadn't left before because he was suicidal and every time our relationship grew thin he would threaten to kill himself or say he wouldn't survive without me. You can see why I couldn't just walk away.

Story number eight... After this relationship I had a lot of tinder sex with similar circumstances; I would use it as a way to get men to like me because I felt there was nothing else they could possibly want me for. Because of this a lot of the instances were barely consensual. However, there was one that was 100% not consensual and was most DEFINITELY rape. I met this guy, he was really really nice and normal and we were getting along really well. We went for coffee and even the barista said we were cute together. Then we went for dinner because we spent so long talking we skipped dinner... He was respectful of my eating habits and food choices and we talked more and more. Finally it came time to bid our goodbyes and he offered me a ride home. I took the ride and when he got to my place he parked and kind of made it clear that he wanted to come in. I'm a pushover so I didn't bat an eye despite knowing exactly where this was going. Now, you must know that this came at a time that I had started to be ok with being single and started to see my dating patterns and how it was harmful. I had decided that I didn't want any more hookups but that I wanted to keep dating people. I figured this would weed out the assholes from the good people based on who would or wouldn't wait for me. Anyways, he came into my place and we chatted for a while and started watching a movie (I can't even remember which one) and then we started kissing and I stopped and told him that I didn't want to go any further. I explained my situation fairly clearly. He kept saying things like ""oh come on, you know you want to,"" etc. I got up and went to the washroom because I was angry. I stood in there for a while with the door closed because I didn't know what to do. I was trying to decide if I'd just let him do it and get it over with (sad but true) or if I'd shut it down. I came back out and he was in my bedroom. He put his arms around me and I told him again what I had said before. When I looked up at him (he was quite tall) he grabbed my face and started making out with me. He forced his disgusting tongue in my mouth and then shoved me onto the bed and started to do everything else that I can barely bring myself to type let alone think. Anyways basically it was very very very rough. It was very painful. I froze up again and did nothing, I just let him flop me around like a rag doll. I had some cuts the next day from where he had pulled at my skin and it broke because of the pressure. I also had bruises. What hurt me the most was that it was the first time I had the bravery to say no and it didn't work. This was in September or October. It is now February. 
Something very similar happened again a few weeks later with a different guy but it wasn't as bad and he could tell something was wrong because it was the first time since that time (^) and I started shaking halfway through and going into shock. He didn't have bad intentions. He was just naive. When I started shaking he stopped. 



What kills me the most about all of this is that I know I have inflicted the feelings I had on many occasions upon two other human beings. Has anyone else out there been abused but also the abuser? How do I understand these things in my adult consciousness when I know they happened as a child? How do I tell my brother? Do I ever tell him? What if I lose my job? This is my entire career that I have worked very hard to build and love with all my heart. I would have to start from ground zero for something that happened when I was a child myself and which I have NO residual desires or ANYTHING of the sort from. Can anyone offer any advice? Do you know about any laws regarding being an underage offender and what your rights are as an adult? I do not pose any threat to a child. I know that for myself. :'( I feel like that was an entirely different person from who I am now. It is more of a vignette in my mind than a memory. I am in shock and disbelief about my own actions. 

Also how do you guys (rape/sexual abuse victims) deal with instances such as those where there was never any official saying ""no"" or ""stop""? Does this still count as rape? Sigh. :/// ",10,8.0,2017-02-16 11:39,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/5uebrr/remorse_i_need_help_re_sexual_abuse_assault_and/,Neutral

I thought he was very adorable and I never actually liked any of the guys that message me on kik but I just really liked him for some reason.

   After talking for a while, we decided to video chat on skype. Just as we were about to get to business, I realized what I was doing and ended the call. I thought he was such a nice guy and I realized what would happen to him if anyone found out about this and I felt extremely guilty.

   I explained this to him and told him we should keep chatting because he is nice, but appearantly I was thinking about his well being more than he was because he kept on. I just tried to explain to him that this could make him a registered sex offender and ruin his life and if not that, he would probably hate himself for it in the future but he wouldn't stop so I gave up

   He has been messaging me all day, sent me 5 pictures of his dick, one video of him masturbating while looking at my picture, went through all my social media accounts and left very creepy comments, and even got in contact with my friends somehow

19399,5o9y0c,post,[Tough Love] Is it wrong that I want to ruin his fucking life?,"[No Regrets]

Last year my SO was somewhat violently groped by a longtime friend of hers coming back from a mutual friends party. She called me in a state of distress I had never seen before, I convinced her to go to the police and had him arrested. He was drunk (He is a heavy alcoholic with a DUI record) and on anti-anxiety meds so he woke up in the holding cell with no idea what he had done. 

Over the next few months I saw her wake up to nightmares, shake in her sleep, cry sporadically, and generally have more emotional issues than I had noticed before. It's getting better though.

The legal process has been moving at a pathetic speed, the public prosecutor seems competent but detached from the situation. I'm not sure how the criminal case will end up and I know I don't have too much control over what happens other than telling the attorney we don't want to give him any slack as far as the criminal charges go. All I know is that I want him to suffer. I'm considering having us go after him in a civil suit, not because we want money (He doesn't have any and we're fine in that regard). I want to make sure the most rudimentary search of his name makes it known what he's done. He's going to school to work in a hospital, I want him on the sex-offender registry so that dream fucking dies. I want everybody in his life to know what he did.

Some people who were acquainted with him have suggested that I was going too far, putting a permanent record on his life for a mistake that he made while he was drunk, that he regretted horribly. If I'm being honest I don't even care what happens or if he's rehabilitated or not. He's been going to alcoholism meetings which the attorney said was likely a ploy to get a better plea but it makes no difference to me. I've always seen him as a scummy piece of shit who deliberately goes after woman who are drunk or insecure, the only thing that changed is that he got too drunk to realize that my SO wouldn't be an easy target. Putting effort towards prolonging his ordeal is the only thing I know how to do with the anger I'm holding legally. My SO is one of very few people I sincerely care about and seeing her emotionally scarred makes me want revenge. Am I a vindictive, petty piece of shit? I know I'm going after him for the wrong reasons entirely, but I also know that sex offenders are the lowest form of life and I sincerely don't think he has the capacity to ever do anything of value to anybody. A more mature person would say to focus on moving on, but this feels right in a very basic sense.

Side note: There should be a [Conflicted] tag. Not sure if I feel remorse or not. Trying to come to that conclusion myself I guess.","[Tough Love] Is it wrong that I want to ruin his fucking life? [No Regrets]

Two years ago, I got a new client named ""Sean."" He disclosed to me that he was had been informally accused of acting inappropriately with young boys. He was honest about his conduct, but held firm that he never crossed the line. The basis of our sessions were to help him understand why he, as a 40yo man, needed to be around young kids and break that habit. And then help him socialize around people his own age. He was one of the few patients that I had who changed his life around. 

Out of the blue, he tells me that he was recently arrested for child molestation. The accusation stemmed from an alleged incident that occurred before he started seeing me. He insisted that he did a lot of bad things, but was no abuser. A part of me felt that there was some truth to the allegation.

This set him into a downward spiral. I really believed that he would end up killing himself if he had to do time. Like I said, I am not used to dealing with such heavy issues, but he felt that we had a relationship established and I had helped with get through other troubled times.

He opted to take his case to trial because the only deals made to him involved becoming a sex offender and doing time. 

Out of the blue, he asks me to be a witness at his trial. He said that I could tell people that he is no predator and should not go to jail. Apparently, it looks really good to have a mental health professional who has a longstanding relationship with a defendant to take the stand on his behalf.

The problem?

I do think he is a pedophile and a predator. I do not judge him for it, but I do not feel right in becoming involved with a criminal court case where my reputation would be on the line if he walks and ends up molesting a child. 

I told him that I would not be comfortable being a witness and explained it was for his own good. He tells me that his life is on the line, literally. I apologize and decline again.

Out of the blue, I am served with a subpoena from his lawyer compelling me to be a witness in his trial. This puts me in a bad spot. If I am honest about my professional opinion about his being a pedophile and a predator, then it would ruin my career. No one will want to hire a psychologist who sells her clients out on the stand. Yet, personally I cannot go on the stand and be a witness to let him walk because no psychologist wants to be associated with a patient who ends up abusing children.

By throwing a subpoena at me, he cornered me. I decided that I will probably paint him as he wants me to. It's the only thing that makes sense. Whatever the outcome is, I will no longer have him as a patient. I also found out that he was advised by his lawyers to seek mental health help before being charged so the defense team can argue that he has already started on the path to redemption.

I'm a former addict. 12 months clean, last week. Again. I'm a fuck up. I think I was born a fuck up. I was finally on a good path with a wonderfully smart and caring woman. Most importantly she was so normal. She brought a light into my life that nobody has ever before. She'd only looked at me in disgust and horror once. When I vomited all over her during sex. 

I never deserved her time in the first place. I was a crappy boyfriend. I never had money to buy her gifts at Christmas. I forgot to Skype her when she went away on business trips (frequently) and I started using again behind her back around 2 years in. Just a little bit. One day. I have no excuses or reasons. I'm an indecent person. She knew instantly. I lied to her. I got offended, defensive and angry and shouted at her when she asked me if it was true. I got loaded that night and made the biggest mistake of my life. I slept with someone else. An ex girlfriend. Who is by no means a bad person like me but also has made mistakes. Everyone has I guess. To her this wasn't a mistake though. 

She fell pregnant and told me over 3 months in. Abortion is illegal in our country and she is a religious type and her life's goal was to be a mother, regardless. I did an incredibly dishonourable thing and moved away, only  telling my sweet girl that I no longer loved her and not to contact me. It makes me ill thinking about how I ended things with her and how I was not man enough to be honest. I thought the truth would be too hurtful but my lies were just as bad - if not worse. Every waking moment I have regretted my actions. There is not a single night I haven't dreamt of her face.

I thought I was at least doing right in one way. Providing a house for the mother of my child and my child. Trying to be a ""normal family"". Working a good job. I honestly thought we could make it work for the sake of the child.

My child was born and I felt only grief. Not much has changed. I was told the first year is the hardest. So I went to classes. I'm still going to classes. I feel like scum for feeling empty inside. I look after my child, I provide for my child, I clothe, feed, wash, comfort and try to be loving. But I know it's not real. I almost lost her due to to illness and I felt empty. I would never ever harm or neglect her but I worry I am not a good person for her to be around.

I stayed clean. I got a better job. I tried to be normal. I thought maybe I was just scared of the tiny screaming thing. But she's growing and I can tell she doesn't look at me the same way she looks at her mother. I broke down one night to a friend and I could tell they thought I was broken and vile. I went to a dad group. I felt like an imposter. I still feel like an imposter. I feel like I am damaging this life that could be so much better off without me.

I have tried to kill myself routinely since she started breathing. I cannot even do that properly. Since my last attempt I have realised how selfish and cowardly I am and I am now trying to make it up to everyone I have hurt.

I realize that there are no words that can make everything okay. But I will keep trying to mend bridges until the day I die.

The girl I treated so badly is doing well. As she should be. She's everything she deserves to be, successful, surrounded by people that look at her lovingly and doing everything she ever dreamed of doing.

She is better off without me in her life. I know it. I wasn't trying to be selfish but I messaged her trying to mend that bridge but made it clear I did not deserve forgiveness. She didn't reply. I messaged again a week later wishing her all the best and that if she ever felt like she could talk to me again to please do so.

She replied some time later, I was having a bad day. She said anything she did have to say would not be over social media and she thought I was disgusting and she did not need anything I had to say and for me to stop trying to ease my guilt.

I must have made her upset though because she called me cruel and told me she had never felt so worthless and how she was actually very ill for a long time because of the stress I put her through.

--

It made me feel even more ashamed. I could only reply: ""I'm so sorry, I hate myself for what I have caused and I hope you are well now"".

--

I'm sure she wishes she'd never opened it. And I only feel worse for sending it. I never thought I would ever get the opportunity to speak with her again and yet somehow I got it and even with honest intentions, I managed to be a prick and make it all about me. 

--

I spoke to my doctor today who suggested some time away from home. Perhaps moving back in with my parents. It feels so unkind but I feel like moving back in with my parents and not having daily contact with my child is better for her. I am not the parent she deserves. Her mother has no words for me except to tell me to do chores/parental duties. I don't deserve anything else but there are days when I don't speak a word out loud. It's not right. She is a good mother, I would have disdain for me too if I had to live with me. I'm just a negative energy. They would be better off without me. My own mother is furious at me. I've done nothing but cause her pain and now I can't even find it in me to be a man and a decent father.

My company is i trouble and giving everyone the run around too so it's likely soon I won't even be able provide financially for my child. I just fuck up everything I touch. I don't want this child to hate me and every day I am thankful she doesn't look like me and hopeful she inherits none of my qualities.

--

I feel like I need time by myself to come to terms with everything. That probably is very selfish but it's driving me insane. I know bad things are happening to me because I did bad things to other people. There are so many other things I've done that are irrelevant to this that are still horrible. I've been a terrible son, a terrible friend, a terrible marine, a terrible father, a terrible partner to so many people, a terrible student, a terrible human.

--

How can I be so horrible at being a human? I've been on anti-depressants as far back as I can remember and yet I feel like I'm only really feeling what it's truly like to be depressed now. It's all my fault. If I could do anything to take back that night I would. I would give anything to see my love again. Anything to not be responsible for fucking up 3 more lives. 

--


I have tried so hard to focus on my child being a new chapter and a new page and finally the chance to do something right and good but it isn't working out like that and every night she cries that I can't comfort her is another night I am reminded how useless I am. Who can't comfort their own child? I can feel her mother growing understandably weary at my shortcomings. She also deserves better. 

--

I know this kind of thing is not meant to be easy. I know this reads like some fucking stupid TV show storyline. All my friends are dead from drug abuse and war, 90% of people who truly know me are repulsed by me and I'm trying to talk to Dads in coffee shops about sugar free snacks and the price of daycare. I'm not looking sympathy, I deserve none. But if anyone who has been as selfish and disgusting as I have has made it through to the other side, please give me some hope. I am drowning.

19409,4fwcvo,post,Bird Habit,"I used to masturbate onto birds at a local park. Not a thing that I'm particularly proud of but I became quite good at it. I was taking zinc supplements so I was shooting massive loads and it became something of a sport to me. For anyone interested here is your best strategy. first, you need to find an isolated spot so you don't become a sex offender. I found a short kind of channel area where I saw the pigeons would congregate. Next, you arouse yourself. I was usually content with envisioning the occasional jogging lady coming over and taking a shit on my chest and that was enough to fuel the fire but if you're not as sexually charged as me just take some porn on the go. After you're good an horny, you get some bread. My pigeons preferred white bread but healthier birds might have a taste for honey wheat or maybe even multigrain. Fat, unhealthy birds are slower and easier to hit so remember that. Once you are seated on the bench and ready to do the deed, whip your roosevelt out and scatter bread out within a few feet of you. use your judgement based on how far you know you can cum. I was a lonely and depraved soul who could hit targets the size of a thimble at distances up to 4 feet. You wait for the pigeons to begin eating and to get comfortable with your presence. At this point, you want to coo gently and talk sensually to them to gain their trust. Now you're finally ready to cum on your bird. This is a tough part because the rapid motion of masturbation is very frightening to the birds, so you have to be subtle. Once you master a technique, you simply wind it up and let it go, aiming depending on your past cumming experiences. I always came high so I would aim for the neck of the bird and catch it right in the face. It's an extremely satisfying and erotic feeling, seeing those birds reel around covered in cum and maybe even transporting it to other places in the city.","Bird Habit I used to masturbate onto birds at a local park.

19410,4bon4s,post,It took me 20 years but I finally got revenge on my old middle school teacher,"I was the product of a one-night stand and subsequently raised by a bipolar mother. When I started the 6th grade, I came home one day and found her dead from a suicide. My soul left my body that day. I ended up going to foster care and got to stay in the same school. No one bothered to get me counseling or ask how I was doing (this was circa 1993). I slacked off in school and started cutting. One day, my teacher got pissed off that half the class did not do their homework. She singled me out and said ""just because you are an orphan doesn't give you the right to be lazy"" in front of the whole class. I largely kept to myself and assumed that people didn't know about my family life, but they knew because of her. From that point on, kids treated me like a leper. Almost that if they spoke to me then their parents would die. I vowed that no matter how my life turned out, I would get revenge on that teacher. I even thought about doing a Coumbine and didn't because I did not want to hurt certain people.
I did get counseling and every time a counselor would urge me to let go of that comment, I became more determined to get revenge. 
I did group therapy and there was this guy who talk about how his middle school teacher molested him. In very graphic detail. I decided that I would accuse this teacher of raping me. I basically stole this dudes story and changed some parts to make it seem more realistic. Then I went to the cops. I told them how he put his hands down my pants and would bribe me with candy that be kept in the middle left drawer of his desk. Or how he would stick his tongue in my mouth and noticed that he has a slight stain on his canine. I remembered all those details because I would daydream about killing him in class. 
They ended up arresting him, ruined his career, and he was forced to take a plea deal where he got no jail time but is now a sex offender. The prosecution played up how I was a vulnerable child who had no parent looking after me. They subpoenaed his work records and made little discretions seem like red flags. They even talked about how he was very much into teen porn because he had a subscription to a legal porn site. 
Best of all, the school disrict gave me a 100k settlement to not sue them. I have zero remorse. If he had apologized to me or if someone had shown me compassion then I wouldn't have needed to get revenge.

I found out after trying to find out about this sport's club he used to captain. I was shocked because he didn't seem like the kind of guy you would think would get into that stuff. I understand why he didn't tell anyone and explains why he seemed off last year (he said his mom was dying but now I know the truth). We work for a large professional service company and there are no kids. I suspect no one knows. I thought about sending an anonymous letter to HR and his boss to inform them. But another side of me says that I should leave it alone. I don't think I can work with him and I am not going to quit or be stressed out at my job over him. I feel 80/20 that I want him to go.

19413,44kpkn,post,[No Regrets] I'm becoming a fucked up person,"I don't really know why this is, or really what this says about me, but with time, I'm becoming more, and more fucked up with my opinions, and views of specific things. Some people haven't noticed this, but a lot of Redditors have a tendency to defend, or have sympathy for pedophiles. That's not what necessary bugs me, what bugs me is that people will automatically say something along the lines of ""Falsely accused?"". One sex in particular says, or thinks things like that. 

When it comes to sex crimes, and sex offenders that were convicted, and not falsely accused, I'm just an unsympathetic, fucked up person. I have a cousin who was molested when she was younger. Her uncle did it, and he did it to three other young girls in the family. I asked her recently if she would feel that rapists/pedophiles deserve sexual assault in prison. She said no, because she wouldn't wish that on no one. I think they deserve everything they get in prison. I have a strong, deep pitted hatred for sex offenders. It's horrible, and I'm aware of it. 

I had two friends I was once close to. I let both of them get away with a lot of it, and I used to be a nicer person than I am now. The first one just became a royal douche bag after his dad got rich. He fell into a pyramid scheme called Vemma, because he's stupid, and really sheltered. It's absolutely ridiculous, because he's so trusting, and just has unrealistic views of the world/people. He was so condescending to me, and I'm sure other people. When it comes to ""hot"" girls, he's so much more nicer to, and he would probably do almost anything for. I stuck by him for a really long time, and we were really close friends for years until he turned into a kind of bad person. He has super fucked up views of sexual assault in general. I'm pretty sensitive to people trivializing/joking around about rape. I told him more than once that it upset me when he would just constantly fucking do it, but he kept doing it until I had to go into detail, and almost cry in front of him. He said he had more than one friend that was ""falsely"" accused of rape, then he said he has a friend that want's to rape a girl. Like, it's his fantasy, but he supposedly won't act on it. Yet, he's still friends with that person, and sympathizes with him. Maybe it's true, that friend hasn't actually acted on it, and is getting help, but maybe not. who knows. He's just the type of person who'll automatically defend any of his buddies who were ever ""falsely"" accused of it. He's a victim blamer, and he did something really fucked up to me once. I doubt he even remembers. He put me down a lot, and just made me feel like crap a lot.

I used to be the type of person who just wouldn't really say anything to someone if it bothered me, and just avoided conflict at all costs. Now, I will confront someone if I needed to, because I don't let people step all over me anymore. 

Friend 2 was a dick. We had a mutual friend who we'll call Dom. I really didn't know the true reason why they weren't friends anymore. Friend 2 just said Dom replaced us with some stoner friends for who knows what reason. No no, friend 2 was just a mega dick to Dom, which after a couple years of being a good friend to me, he turned into a dick to me as well. Confronting him never accomplished anything. He's very manipulative, and always justified his actions by saying he was depressed. Both Dom, and I have dealt with depression, and we weren't ever like that to anyone. Friend 2 started slowly. He once texting me ""Stop"", then I said ""Stop what?"", he said ""Being fat"". Then just more stuff like that. Then when I stopped talking to him or whatever he made a giant joke about it, and texted me randomly just making fun of the whole thing. He's really manipulative, and three times I talked to him again. It's totally my fault that I let him in my life after the first time. He got kicked out of his parent's house at 22, because for one, he didn't get a job until he was 19, and two, he just wouldn't get a job. He pretty much either played video games all day, or watched anime, then expected his parents to pay for his vegan, organic, healthy food/tea. 

I hate people. I really fucking do. All people are shitty in some way. Myself included. I don't really trust people, because you just can't. If anyone in my life, friends, family, anyone were to ever be accused of sex crimes, or really anything, I wouldn't automatically defend them, or believe them, because people lie. Obviously, any rapist would say some girl false accused them, to ""ruin"" their life/reputation.

19414,3yzi7w,post,Suppressed Emotions,"[Light]: Casual confessions

I wasn't sure if this is the right subreddit to post this or if I even wanted to post this.

I apologize ahead of time if I offended anyone with my comments in the beginning. I did not intend to cause offense.

**Lifestyle**

I came out two years ago to everyone aside from my parents. I never needed to come to terms with myself for being gay because I never question myself about my orientation. I was comfortable with myself. I was lying to myself. I do not know what is considered being comfortable with your orientation. Do I have to act a certain way or is it just a matter of being myself? The obvious answer that others would tell you is to be yourself, but what if I am not even comfortable with being myself. What am I supposed do then? I do not know because life does not have a handbook for me.

When I came out, I thought it was going to lift all my problems away. It did until a few months ago. It was not a sudden change but a gradual one. When I started college I slowly exposed myself to gay culture (sort of). I think the biggest thing I did was download Tinder. Prior to college, the last thing I cared about was being in a relationship, so I thought why not give it a shot, throw myself out there. I knew finding the right person was going to be difficult, but it was beyond impossible. I was pretty much doing checklist dating. I had to factor too much stuff in coupled with my shallow standard they can’t be feminine and must act normal. Right now I realised how much I hated being gay. I say to myself I wish I was not gay, but at the same time I do not care to be straight either. I spent a night with a guy, but the morning after. I felt so empty. He wanted a relationship, but I did not feel anything for him because once I got to my dorm room I began to question to myself whether or not I was gay. I feel like I do not fit in anywhere. I dislike feminine and extreme flamboyant guys, and I try extremely hard to make sure I’m nothing like those qualities either. Except how do you even find other masculine guys that have similar interests if the gay culture is predominantly fem/flamboyant? Aside from the fem/flamboyant gays I also get grossed out by the people who take the words “express yourself” too far in my opinion. A month ago I checked out a gathering for lgbtq individuals who wanted to study together for finals. I asked a friend to come with me because I was afraid to go alone. In all honesty, I was hoping to meet someone, but the second I got there I noped out. It just confirmed my belief that there aren’t any “normal” gay people out in the open. Plus, I feel as if all gay people want to do is have sex. I think about having sex a lot too, but I just want that same person to be able to talk about intellectual stuff or play video games with me, but that seems to be an impossible criteria to add with all my other standards.

**Emotional**

I thought I was the most emotional person ever, and I was not afraid to express it, but I realised I’m not. When I was at my grandma’s funeral a few days ago. I didn’t shed a single tear nor did I have any feelings of sadness. I thought something was wrong with me. She’s my grandma why don’t I feel sad. I rationalized that it’s because I’ve only met her twice in my lifetime but come on she’s dead. Never will I be able to talk to her if I ever wanted to. I just kept thinking to myself, am I dead inside? I thought back to all the other moments when I was suppose to show emotion, but I realised I showed little emotion. A majority of it was faked, to show empathy. A friend needed to talk to me, and when it was my turn to reciprocate, I knew what was needed to be said, I knew how they were feeling, but I couldn’t show the genuine feelings, so I faked it. I did the same exact thing when this guy that was interested in me called me today, but I faked the emotions because I didn’t know how to actually show the feelings.

**Family**

I hate my parents, especially my dad. I understand that because they raised me I should be grateful, but they make it feel like I have obligations sometimes. They are too traditional. In their culture, they believe that the just because someone is older they have authority. Fuck that ideal. I’ll follow whoever is truly more experienced and more knowledgeable. I’m not going to blindly follow some idiot because they are older than me. They also believe family is important, but there is too much emphasis on it. Because I have not told them that I was gay, I asked a different question, “would you hate me if I did not get married?” They answered with, “what do you mean not get married,” “don’t say that,” and “you have to get married otherwise dad will be upset because you need to pass on the family name.” To me why does it matter? A family name is just a family name. It also upset me that they don’t understand. My personal life is out of their sphere of control. Why does it matter whether or not I pass on the family name. If they want grandchildren I can adopt. Times have changed, and we don’t live in China anymore either. This is one of the reason I realised I can’t tell them that I’m gay. I already understand their stance on the situation. My brother tells me whether or not they accept it they will love me unconditionally. I doubt that’s true. I have the worst relationship with my dad, with the exception of a few bliss moments, and when I asked my mom about her stance when Illinois legalized gay marriage, she stood her ground on the opposition of that topic. I don’t understand myself why it even matters if I tell my parents, but for some reason it upsets me that I can’t.

I'm not sure what I'm expecting by posting this, but I needed somewhere to vent because I don't have anyone I can trust to say this to. Perhaps I hope someone can relate in some way or tell me something.","Suppressed Emotions [Light]: Casual confessions

I feel guilty that I have been an alcoholic for 12 years. I went to rehab in 2014 and tell people I'm sober, even though I started drinking again shortly after. I went on a 14-day binge 8 days ago.

I feel guilty that my mom is sickly and homeless. I wish she would just pass away already, so she doesn't have to suffer anymore. I've given her 20k over the years to help her with this and with that, but she will never be normal, responsible, or get it together. I pretend to be interested in the things she says to me because I feel sorry for her, but I know she will never get it right. 

I feel guilty that I spend my money on stupid shit all the time and I'm always broke and in debt.

I feel guilty that I have lost MANY friends because of my behavior, the things I've said, the way I’ve acted, and the lies I’ve created over the years. I deactivated my Facebook account because I can't even trust myself to behave appropriately and I've offended too many friends.

I feel guilty for fondling an older woman sitting next to me on an airplane ride. She was obviously very uncomfortable.

I feel guilty for having sex with my friend's wife when he deployed to Iraq. He still doesn't know, although they divorced shortly afterwards. 

I feel guilty for staying at my brother’s house for 6 months while I ""got on my feet"". All I did was drink and play video games. He put his whole family in an uncomfortable position just to accommodate that.

I feel guilty for kissing my friend's wife on the cheek twice when I was drunk and being over friendly. She deleted me from Facebook shortly after and he hasn't talked to me since. Although neither of them have mentioned anything about it to me, that surely has to be the reason.

I feel guilty for being obscene and dramatic for shock value. 

I feel guilty for sticking my penis on my friend’s head when she was passed out drunk. Then telling her about it later while I was laughing. She wants nothing to do with me now.

19416,3vke7p,post,Men are the worst at sex,"[No Regrets]

I'm sorry guys, but you just are. I get that your penis is an incredibly big deal to you, and that it pretty much drives you during sex. But here's the thing: Your penis alone isn't enough to make a girl feel good. I don't care how big it is, or how powerful you think it is. Just sticking it in there and waggling it around like an epileptic chipmunk doesn't make me feel good. And telling me how you're going to ""pound [me] like a jackhammer for hours"" sounds less like seduction and more like a threat. 

Guys with big dicks are the worst for this. They think that they can just ram it in there dry and hump away. For a smaller woman like myself, that fucking hurts. How would you feel if I stuck your dick in a vice and flattened it? How about a little fucking empathy, or just fucking listening to your partner?

But the worst? When guys get offended that I can't get off from penetration alone, like when my ex complained that he wouldn't give me oral because it takes me like 20 minutes to come. I'm like ""Bitch! I just spent forty minutes giving you the best head of your life, AND I did it with a smile on my face, because I WANTED to make you feel good. And you piss and moan at the thought of returning the favor?"" Yeah, I dumped him shortly after.

With women, we actually enjoy our partner's enjoyment. There's this sense of... empathy?.. I guess, that I very rarely feel with male lovers. This sense of ""we're both humans and in this together, so let's do our best for each other."" There's only been one man I ever felt that with, but unfortunately we just had bad timing. In the very unlikely circumstance that I lose my girlfriend and meet a man with that some sort of heart again I'd consider dating him. But other than that, I'm sticking to my lady and enjoying the sweet, sweet orgasms.

19417,3uiz6e,post,Did something REALLY stupid while drunk. I don't know how to live with myself..,"[Remorse]: If you feel bad 

When I was a junior in college (almost 3 years ago), I had a roommate who was also one of my best friends. We would do things all the time, go out together, and it was awesome. When drunk, he would get super handsy with me. He would do things like show us (his friends) his balls sometimes, and it was all kind of a joke. 

At one point, he and I were joking around (sober) and he ended up carrying me up to my bed and pinning me down and laying on top of me. We just kind of looked at each other for a minute. I wasn't sure what was going to happen after that, so I got nervous and laughed it off. To clarify, I am gay, and he is allegedly straight. 

We would spend tons of time together hanging out and I was so happy to have made a new close friend who I also lived with. After winter break, when we came back to school for the spring semester, he had been there the night before and was drunk and sent me messages that said things like, ""I like you,"" ""I want it sooo bad.... From you... "" And ""cum to me tmrw."" I laughed these off, but also thought it was interesting that he was saying these things. 

So the next night when I got back to school, we went out, got very drunk, and when we came home, we fell asleep on his bed. He was cuddling / spooning me, and we fell asleep like that. Later, I must've woken up, and with him (asleep) still cuddling me, wanted to touch him back. 

Being a complete idiot, I acted on my urge to feel what his penis was like, and stroked it for a minute or two. I wanted to see what he would do, but was also nervous, so when he moved I stopped. But then like a complete fool, I kept stroking it lightly for another minute or two. Finally, I realized that this was very wrong and I shouldn't have done that. I went back to sleep and we woke up the next day. I felt like a disgusting person and a pervert, shocked at why the hell I would ever do such a thing. I was upset the entire day, and he could tell. He asked me if I was alright and told me to be happy. That told me that he either didn't know what happened, or maybe just wanted to move forward from it. 

Now, almost three years later, this is haunting me. I feel like I should turn myself into the police. I've been reading all of these stories about sexual assault and how terrible it is, and I feel like a monster. I can't believe I did this when I was drunk. I'm not sure how I can forgive myself. Thinking of going to jail and being labeled as a sex offender and having people know I did something so egregious makes me want to kill myself, and I've been thinking that that is the only alternative lately. I don't know how to tell my boyfriend about this, because I feel that he will for sure break up with me, and find out who ""the real me"" is, and I love him so deeply. I just want to move on and have a good life. I feel like a disgusting ""imposter"" of a good person, and feel like I don't deserve the things that I have. All I can do is read on the internet about similar situations, and think about how terrible my actions were. 

I don't know whether or not I should tell my friend what happened, and whether I should talk to my boyfriend about it, but this is killing me. My friend and I are still very close, and I've since slept in the same room multiple times with him with absolutely no issues, but that one event is making me sick.  

Clearly, I would NEVER do anything like this to anyone ever again, but I fear that I will have to live with this for the rest of my life and hate myself.

19418,3ufu9a,post,Had sex with an employer's employee at work on my last day on contract. Not sure what to make of it.,"[Remorse]: If you feel bad 

I do contract IT work so I'm generally in and out of places after a couple weeks.  People usually treat me like I'm invisible which I'm fine with.  No point getting attached to strays right.

Didn't even talk to her much.  Probably said hello and how are you a handful of times.  That's it.  Was outside waiting for someone to buzz me in to secondary building at end of day.  Just to collect things and leave.  She answered at door.  Opens door and I start to head in.  Says ""No"", pushes me back, not hard but I think I've violated some entry rule so I accept it.  Back against wall.  All of a sudden she is on her knees and pulling my jeans down (very casual workplace, got to wear jeans, running shoes and a tshirt every day).  She is insanely attractive.  Thigh high boots, very petite, skirt, slightly younger than me (so mid to late twenties), the whole deal.  So I don't even think about possible consequence.  Just holy shit I feel like I'm in a porn.  Can't believe this is happening.  So just go with it.

Am being pretty tame but once she gets me rock hard she makes eye contact, rubs my dick all over her face, and goes ""I knew you'd have a beautiful penis.""  I am like yeah okay there's no way she *knew* but I'm not arguing with her.  Grab her head and she drops her hands.  I am pretty much in control of it from then on.

So that is just oral.  All in all maybe three minutes.  I could've gone all day on that mouth but I could tell she wanted me to hurry up.  Just a quickie so no one gets suspicious.  She's probably done things like this before in her life because cleans up real well.  Absolutely no evidence anything happened.

Then we go in and as soon as we get in she laughs and goes ""Yeah, sometimes we forget to check these doors, sorry it took so long to get you.""  And I'm impressed, because she's effortlessly shifting into pretending we were having casual office banter.  What a pro.  Get to ""my"" desk and start packing my things up.  She's back to wherever she came from at this point.  Everyone else is leaving and ignoring me.  Head to bathroom to take a shit before I leave.  When I leave I start heading to front to sign out.  Place is basically deserted.  She appears ahead, rounded the corner.  I decide to pretend I don't see her because I am now invisible contractor leaving never to be seen again and the aggressive oral is history that didn't happen.  So casually walk by.  Heart racing though because fuck she is sexy and I'm still high off the fact that she let me use her face for a few minutes.

As we pass she doesn't say anything.  Just reaches over and gets a few fingers on my chest, hard at first but more gentle as she slides fingertips off the side of my body.  Maybe two seconds but remember it all.  Suddenly alert to her smell and her sex and my dick raging to fuck her because god damn I want more I don't want this to be over.

She acknowledges nothing.  But goes to women's bathroom.  This office.  There were three buildings.  This one was detached and not as nice as the main one (because that was where all visitor traffic was).  Bathrooms here were one person with locks.  And as she goes in I see her hand holding the door open.  Like when you're waiting for someone behind you.  My mind is being blown here.  So I start to head for it.  Then it closes when I get close.  No click of lock though.  Decide to knock.  Not sure what I'll say if she opens and acts professional but offended but fuck.  She just opens it.  So I go in.  Looks at me.  I mean she's tiny so she's looking *up* at me.  And goes ""Hi"".  Grab the back of her head and kiss her hard like when I was in high school.  Fuck her pretty hard.  Shove my tie in her mouth to shut her up.  She got dramatic and faked choking but you know.  Wasn't real.  Likely wanted me to genuinely gag her but I'm too old to fuck women that rough anymore.  Give some but no longer full throttle.  Too aware of risk.  Pulled on her tits pretty hard though.  That got some genuine squeals and those reactions are always a major turnon.  Don't know what was going on in her life or her day but she clearly wanted a bit of abuse.  Gave her some but know limits.  Not looking to hurt someone, only provide good service.

Had to fight to get my dick out of her.  She really wanted me to finish inside but I'm not dealing with that headache.  She started getting dressed after but I stopped her.  Wanted more.  Too good just to leave.  She knew and kind of laughed but I shut that up pretty quick.  Finished pretty quick and then left her there.  Was a mess but I knew she'd clean up ok.

Didn't say shit to each other.  Got in vehicle and went home.  Been a couple months and nothing happened.  With the rape accusations these days you can never be sure.  And I don't know what kind of person she is.  But had to tear that ass up.  Sex was a bit rough but god damn.  If I got put in the situation to redo it I'd do it the same way even knowing the anxiety of the ""what ifs"" after.  Obviously there's regret because sex is never without remorse.  Always run risk of something unforseen happening.  Would love to have her over for dinner then spend the whole night with her pussy in my face.  Too good.  But chasing would ruin it.  Just another one of those life scenarios where I have to accept something spontaneous happened and it was amazing, but that's it.  It's done.

Never able to accept it.  Obviously infuriating because back to life.  Hum drum, waiting for the next out of the blue event that may never come.  If I die and there is heaven then it's feeling my penis slide in and out of her for all eternity.  Perfect fit.  She probably feels the same way.  But that's it.  It was heaven and it's over.

And now I'm miserable.","Had sex with an employer's employee at work on my last day on contract. Not sure what to make of it. [Remorse]: If you feel bad

19419,3tze6f,post,I am a former school teacher-turned-sex offender/HR manager,"[Remorse]: If you feel bad 

This is going to be the most brutal confession. I am a 40 year-old sex offender. I was a 3rd grade teacher for about eight years and got along so well with the parents that it was not unusual for some of the boys to come over to my house to play or even sleepovers. I NEVER touched any child. It wasn't my style. I didn't even become a school teacher because of kids; it was more about finding a stable job and getting a lot of vacation time. 

I did have a drug problem that I used to cope with my depression. I was depressed because I was lonely, sexually confused (I know that I am gay) and had sexual feelings towards boys. I knew I would never act out on those feelings by touching a child. I did look and store child porn. 

I felt guilty and disgusted by it. I felt horrible that I had child porn on my laptop that I used for work, but I couldn't give it up. Eventually, I started to find other guys like me in hopes of finding some kind of support. One of the guys who reached out to be was a cop and I knew it because I googled his email address. The email address belong to some child porn trader who was in jail. I told the cop to fuck off and die. 

Over the summer, the cops raided my house. I destroyed most of my equipment but they found a few files on a flashdrive and that it what brought me down. Since it was the summer, I promptly quit my teacher job because I knew the cops would notify the school and everyone would find out. 

It took the cops almost two years to file charges because they wanted to see if they could recover data from my destroyed equipment. During that time, I started a new career in HR and under a new name. In HR, I control all the background checks, including mine. I got probation and had to register as a sex offender.

The hardest part was having to sever ties with the families with whom I was friends with. They never found out and were never contacted. It breaks my heart that I had something so good, but this illness inside me ruined my life. Everyday I worry about my employer finding out or running into one of the families that I was close with. 

I did get counseling and remember the psychiatrist telling me that if I had gone to him before I got busted, then he would have turned me in per state law. Yup, I couldn't even go to a doctor and tell them that I needed help. Would that be an issue if a doctor reported me for having sexual thoughts about boys? Well, I told a cop to fuck off via email and they were able to get a search warrant a month later. 

I thought about what would happen if I didn't get caught. I probably would not be much different in the sense that I would still be depressed, lonely, ashamed, and suicidal. So either way, my life was going down the drain. 

It could be worse. In some ways I got lucky. Sometimes I think about finding a gay guy and getting married and having kids but that would be wrong. I would never want to raise a child knowing that his dad is a sex offender. No good can come from that. Besides, who would want to marry a sex offender?

He is being sentenced for posscession of child porn. He has never molested a kid and never been in trouble with the law. He was molested and looked at the porn that resembled the abuse he went through. The DA and lawyer worked out a plea deal where he gets probation and has to be a registered sex offender for life.

19421,3padha,post,"I had a Tinder hookup, it was totally risky and stupid, but it was amazing!","[No Regrets]: If you don't feel bad


Early yesterday morning, Saturday, I got a message from a cute guy I liked on Tinder the day before.  I have never used online dating and just recently became separated from my husband. I created a profile on two different sites because I knew my husband was cheating on me and in typical fashion he was questioning/blaming me for using dating sites and he brought Tinder up a number of times.

 I ended up leaving the family home about two months ago because my now ex also has a drug addiction among other things. The deal was we were separated but  had committed to staying faithful to each other while he was seeking treatment. He confessed about three weeks later that he already had a girlfriend. I had already created the profiles to see if I could catch him so I decided to maybe check them out for their intended purpose.

I'm maybe a little heart broken but even more so it's  like a huge weight has been lifted off my chest. I know I did everything I possibly could to save our marriage, but in the end there was nothing left to save and his infidelity gave me the justification I felt I needed to walk away. We are getting a divorce and I'm relieved.

I really have no desire to jump back into a relationship. We have three kids that I have sole custodyof them at this point and I am returning to school to start a new career. I don't have the time and my children need all of me right now. 

I had no expectations of meeting anyone, I was just checking out the sites for shits and giggles.  It has been a long time since I dated and even though I am happy with who I am and I discovered I'm a little self-conscious about the way my body looks now after three kids and being almost 40 I have started to age.  I really didn't expect anyone to swipe me or message me, I was very wrong, and very flattered. The  One website that I was using ended up being a bit of a joke because almost every guy who messaged me was a total pig and wanted to send me pictures of their penises so I just deleted that one. Tinder  on the other hand is a lot of fun. I have messaged a couple people back-and-forth a little but for the most part I just like ego boost when I get a match. That was until yesterday morning that is.

 I was up early and heard the familiar ping. I checked my phone and saw the most amazingly sexy man had sent me a message.  We chatted back-and-forth all day. He was at work though,  so it was fairly limited no deep conversations or anything like that. Eventually he asked me if I would be interested in meeting him that night. It just so happened my kids were with their dad because his mother had rented some poolside hotel rooms so all of her grandkids could go water sliding and  spend the night with their respective parents. This also meant of course all of my in-laws were staying at a hotel. 

 As I'm talking to Mr. Tider I find out that he is in my city working for a few weeks and staying in a hotel, just so happens to be the same hotel my children are staying at with my ex-husband.  I was still on the fence as to whether I was going to accept his invitation, until he sent me another picture of himself. After I saw that picture I knew I would be doing myself a great injustice by not going to meet him at the very least.

I consider myself a very sex positive person,  before I was married I thoroughly enjoyed casual encounters but I had never done so with a complete stranger.   My husband and I have been together for 14 years and married for 10. I am not a cheater so he is the only man I have been with and our marriage has been on the rocks due to his addictions for at least four years.  The intimacy had been gone for a long time before we separated. 

I spare the details but I decided to go.  Not only did I decide to go but since it was so late we decided to skip meeting for drinks and I went straight to his hotel room. I still can't believe I took that risk. 

 I told both my brother and my mother where I was going, talk about awkward, and I also gave them his first and last name As well as the name of the company he works for and his phone number. I was fairly confident all of this information was correct because I went ahead and stalked him on Facebook first.  I know the entire Facebook profile could have been made up to but there were comments from family and the account was at least five years old.

You may be thinking, well that was stupid, but I wonder if it was worth it?  As I already said I will spare you the details, but it was more than worth the risk, it was probably some of, if not the best ""risk"" of my life! I'm actually going back tonight for more!

I I have been on cloud nine all day. Not only was it worth the risk but he is a super nice guy.  We have tons of stuff in common and I was very upfront with him about where I am at in life so he's not going to be offended that I do not want a relationship with him beyond friends, but when he is in my city I'll be happy to go visit him at his hotel.

 I haven't felt this beautiful and sexy in a very, very, very long time. 

No regrets is an understatement.

TL;DR: I hooked up with a guy from Tinder and even though I put myself into a risky situation I don't regret it at all and haven't felt this great in years!

EDIT: added TL;DR, tried to fix some typos and grammar but on mobile and too much of a pain in my butt. I'll fix it later when I'm home.

","I had a Tinder hookup, it was totally risky and stupid, but it was amazing! [No Regrets]: If you don't feel bad


Early yesterday morning, Saturday, I got a message from a cute guy I liked on Tinder the day before.  I have never used online dating and just recently became separated from my husband. I created a profile on two different sites because I knew my husband was cheating on me and in typical fashion he was questioning/blaming me for using dating sites and he brought Tinder up a number of times.

 I ended up leaving the family home about two months ago because my now ex also has a drug addiction among other things. The deal was we were separated but  had committed to staying faithful to each other while he was seeking treatment. He confessed about three weeks later that he already had a girlfriend. I had already created the profiles to see if I could catch him so I decided to maybe check them out for their intended purpose.

I'm maybe a little heart broken but even more so it's  like a huge weight has been lifted off my chest. I know I did everything I possibly could to save our marriage, but in the end there was nothing left to save and his infidelity gave me the justification I felt I needed to walk away. We are getting a divorce and I'm relieved.

I really have no desire to jump back into a relationship. We have three kids that I have sole custodyof them at this point and I am returning to school to start a new career. I don't have the time and my children need all of me right now. 

I had no expectations of meeting anyone, I was just checking out the sites for shits and giggles.  It has been a long time since I dated and even though I am happy with who I am and I discovered I'm a little self-conscious about the way my body looks now after three kids and being almost 40 I have started to age.  I really didn't expect anyone to swipe me or message me, I was very wrong, and very flattered. The  One website that I was using ended up being a bit of a joke because almost every guy who messaged me was a total pig and wanted to send me pictures of their penises so I just deleted that one. Tinder  on the other hand is a lot of fun. I have messaged a couple people back-and-forth a little but for the most part I just like ego boost when I get a match. That was until yesterday morning that is.

 I was up early and heard the familiar ping. I checked my phone and saw the most amazingly sexy man had sent me a message.  We chatted back-and-forth all day. He was at work though,  so it was fairly limited no deep conversations or anything like that. Eventually he asked me if I would be interested in meeting him that night. It just so happened my kids were with their dad because his mother had rented some poolside hotel rooms so all of her grandkids could go water sliding and  spend the night with their respective parents. This also meant of course all of my in-laws were staying at a hotel. 

 As I'm talking to Mr. Tider I find out that he is in my city working for a few weeks and staying in a hotel, just so happens to be the same hotel my children are staying at with my ex-husband.  I was still on the fence as to whether I was going to accept his invitation, until he sent me another picture of himself. After I saw that picture I knew I would be doing myself a great injustice by not going to meet him at the very least.

I consider myself a very sex positive person,  before I was married I thoroughly enjoyed casual encounters but I had never done so with a complete stranger.   My husband and I have been together for 14 years and married for 10. I am not a cheater so he is the only man I have been with and our marriage has been on the rocks due to his addictions for at least four years.  The intimacy had been gone for a long time before we separated. 

I spare the details but I decided to go.  Not only did I decide to go but since it was so late we decided to skip meeting for drinks and I went straight to his hotel room. I still can't believe I took that risk. 

 I told both my brother and my mother where I was going, talk about awkward, and I also gave them his first and last name As well as the name of the company he works for and his phone number. I was fairly confident all of this information was correct because I went ahead and stalked him on Facebook first.  I know the entire Facebook profile could have been made up to but there were comments from family and the account was at least five years old.

You may be thinking, well that was stupid, but I wonder if it was worth it?  As I already said I will spare you the details, but it was more than worth the risk, it was probably some of, if not the best ""risk"" of my life! I'm actually going back tonight for more!

19422,3m5g45,post,i am hiding my sex offender status from my employer,"

[Remorse]: If you feel bad 

Last year, I became a subject of a child porn investigation. I was being investigated for allegedly having it. At the time, I was a public employee. Since I was under investigation and charged, no one knew except me and my lawyer. I knew that when I was charged, that my employer would find out, fire me and cost me my career. I promptly quit my job and found an identical job in the private sector. The only way my new job would find out is if I were charged before the background check (public agencies are immediately notified of an employees arrest but not a private sector job). Six months into my new job, I was charged. I pled out and got probation and sex offender registration. My employer has no idea. I took several steps to ensure they would never find out from taking a low visible role to completely changing my back story. I took other steps that I will not disclose. Since then, I have come to terms with my crime and even turned on others who were doing worse despite the fact that I in no way benefitted from snitching on them. I just wanted to feel like I made some amends and did more than the average offender.

To those who wish me bad wishes- I do not care anymore. Had you been more accepting and sensitive to my mental illness then I could have sought help. Criminalizing mental illness is like criminalizing drug use. I couldn't have disclosed to my psychiatrist about my real problems without his reporting me to the police because the law threatens to put him in jail if he doesn't. That is like a drug addict going to rehab with the guarantee that he would be arrested for drugs because someone was hurt or killed in the process of their getting drugs. Makes no sense. I can tell you that the vast majority of us are not monsters. We are the people in your community. We are the teachers, police, leaders, parents, your family, etc. get real. We are not going anywhere. We are not all going to kill ourselves en masse. That's like saying that all the illegals should leave.

19424,3f0432,post,[Remorse] I caught a guy raping a woman at a party,"[Remorse]

Edit: Thanks you all for the comments, I'm feeling much better about the situation now.

When I was 15, I went to a house party with some friends. I have always been socially anxious, so I kept with them most of the night. I separated briefly in order to use the bathroom, and as I was heading back downstairs, I heard something from one of the rooms. Curious, I went to check it out. The door was open a crack, and when I looked in, this guy I had just met was taking some girl's clothes off. Realizing I just interupted something, I turned to leave, but then heard a soft whimper of ""Stop.""

I froze; it had clicked in what was happening but it was as if my mind was in disbelief. I stood there, listening again. She was saying ""No, I don't want to. Stop, please."" She was crying, almost in hysterics. The guy kept saying ""Trust me…shut the fuck up, or I'll knock you the fuck out."" But the next thing he said is what made me snap: ""When a girl says yes, it's yes; when she says maybe, it's yes; when a girl says no, it's still yes.""

I burst into the room and tore him off the bed, and just started throwing fists anywhere I could: his stomach, face, arms, I didn't care. I wanted to fucking hurt him so bad. Then, in the heat of everything, I wrapped my hands around his neck and started chocking him. I could tell he couldn't breath, I knew what I was doing was wrong, but I had lost control. By then, everyone from downstairs had heard what was going on and rushed it. My friend snapped me back to reality and I fell back, letting him go. He coughed and took several breaths as others held me back, and another girl led the victim away.

Police were called, and the guy was arrested. He shouted that I'd tried to kill him; he was raging. The police looked at him, unsympathetic, then asked if anyone else had seen me try to kill them. All of them had, but they took one look at the guy, and all said he was full of it. So, I got away.

Its been ten years since then, and I regret that last part. What he did was disgusting, but I shouldn't have lost control like that. If he'd had died, it would have prevented any sort of closure for anyone, and I would have been a worse person.

Flash forward: The guy spent 2 years in prison, is now a registered sex offender, and living out of province. I don't regret beating him up, but I regret chocking him, and I always will. I don't even know if they would have taken me in anyway, because they knew the guy was scum and a raper, but I don't know. I don't feel good about it.

TL;dr: Caught a guy raping a girl and almost strangled him. Everyone who witnessed it told police the guy was lying, so I got off.","[Remorse] I caught a guy raping a woman at a party [Remorse]

19425,3ee911,post,My low self control when I'm drunk caused me to make some very poor decisions [support only],"[Remorse]: If you feel bad 

Throughout the past few years, I have made very bad decisions when I was drunk.  My stupid drunken actions caused me anxiety and made me extremely self conscious around others.  I know that my state of intoxication does not excuse my behavior BUT I would surely not have done them sober.  Regardless, I have harbored a lot of guilt, shame and regret about it.  I lost some confidence in myself and I might have actually caused my subconscious to believe that I am sort of creep/monster.  So, yes, I did traumatize MYSELF over my actions and probably developed a mental disorder as a result.

- During a New Years Party with some friends, I jerked off inside the toilet, causing a huge line outside of the bathroom.  Everybody knew.  Then, I grabbed the vagina of a girl (no skin contact) right in the middle of the party.  The party immediately stopped and I was just standing there blacked out of my mind.  Next, I jerked off into a trashcan in my room and I sent a dick pic to this girl that I had a crush on in high school.  Me and her have never talked since.  The memory in my mind is hazy but I accept that I feel really embarrassed and ashamed and guilty.  I am going to try to forget about this night and just move on with my life.  I could have gone to jail but God didn't put me in jail that night. 

- It was a special night.  I was in a suit for a special crossing occasion.  I see this girl wearing a dress filling her cup with water.  I proceed to creep up behind and I start groping her tits underneath her dress.  I have been calling myself a monster or a creep from remembering this incident.  She had a shocked look on her face.  Thankfully, my friend intervened and stopped me before it got any worse.  I was somewhat barred out and drunk during the night.  Some girl asked if she should call the cops.  Another girl told me that I needed Jesus.  The girl replies that I'm cute and she will have to get over the incident.  My friend gave me a serious lecture about how I could be put on a sex offender's list.  My heart immediately sunk.  The thing is that I pretended to forget about the whole thing but I remember because it came back to me in the form of a nightmare.  It caused and is still causing me a great deal of stress.  The girl introduced herself to me when I was more sober and she even says hi to me when she sees me.  I AM SO FUCKING SORRY.  Geez, what is wrong with me sometimes?  It must be the cockiness that I had at the time.  Maybe it was sexual impurity and a mixture of stupidness.  I labeled myself a creep ever since I remembered that night (a year ago).  The word creep pops up in my mind and I start to make myself feel uncomfortable.

- I grabbed a lot of girls' boobs/tits and ass when I get really fucked up.

I know I did a lot of wrong.  I don't even know where to begin really.  The damage is already done.  My reputation is tarnished.  I am graduating from college soon.  I have been seeing therapy.  I have reaffirmed my faith in Christ.  Saying sorry isn't going to cut it.  I am going to learn from my drunken experiences.  I currently haven't drank alcohol or done xanax in a really long time.  When I did drink alcohol after those nights, I stopped groping/sexually assaulting girls.  I learned my lessons.  Not trying to go to prison yo.  It is better to ask a girl and get rejected then just do whatever the fuck you want and be a creep about it.  I am thankful that I didn't go to jail.  I know that I am a good person.  I told my sister about what happened and she thinks that I have a conscience.  That being said, none of this would've happened if I didn't get too recklessly blacked out drunk and stupidly horny.  It is all of my fault and now, I am picking up the pieces of my shattered self-identity.  

The fucked up thing is that I traumatized myself.  I was the perpetrator in all of the incidences.  I feel incredibly bad about it.  I have acted a little weird ever since.  What can I say?  I was selfish, wrong and a sexually impure 19-20 year old.

19426,3bhrgg,post,Bathing my 7 year old daughter.,"
[Remorse]: If you feel bad 

I'm a widowed single father aged 37 with a 7 year old daughter. My wife and her mother were killed in a car accident nearly 3 years ago, which was obviously devastating for both my little girl and me. I honestly believe that had it not been for my daughter, I would not still be here.

I had great support from family and friends in the first few months, in particular from my sister and my late wife's sister who both looked after my very young girl who was missing her Mummy and Grandma terribly. Things move on though, people have their own families, and in time it was down to me to look after her on my own apart from day care and then school.

It would not be too dramatic to say that we have always had a special relationship because of what we went through following the accident, and my little girl only wanted to be with me and became very ""clingy"" for want of another word. When I went into the garden she would follow, if I went into the bathroom she would follow, she even wanted to stay as I sat on the toilet - which I had to explain was not really the done thing! If I wasn't there for her 24-7 she would cry uncontrollably and then almost shut down emotionally till I returned - it really was quite distressing for me and I should have sought a bit of help back then, but I just pandered to her and hardly went anywhere without her; the odd trip to the supermarket while her auntie was here - I never went out with friends or women.

I HAD to bath her in those days, for safety and to help her clean herself - for any non-parents reading this, 3 year old kids are NOT very aware of their own personal hygeine needs! Something I remember my late wife saying when she bathed her was ""Let's clean your front bum and your back bum"" which she told me was what her own Mother used to say to her when she was little, so I said it;
A; So she knew we had to get those parts clean, and
B; To remind her a little of her Mum, and how she used to bath her.

Now clearly that had to be done at that time, due to her age, but as she got older, 4, 5 and 6 years old, she still wanted me to bath her, and specially to clean her private parts. Now she is just 7 (her birthday was in September) and still she wants me to bath her, and will now specifically ask ""Now do my back bum"", and ""Now do my front bum"". She really loves me to do it, and will say ""Just a bit more, a bit more, OK!""

I'm starting to feel very uncomfortable now, and I've told her that she should do it herself now, but she won't have it, and gets very withdrawn and sad when I have insisted that she does it. I don't want her upset, so I renaged and started to do it for her again. I do feel that, for her, it's a kind of connection to the past when her Mummy used to do it, which she must remember, and she thinks that Dad has to do it now, because Mum's gone. I'm not offended by it, and in all honesty, I would leave it till she didn't ask any more, but I'm a bit worried that, if she should innocently say something about it to a friend, or worse still, a teacher or one of her aunties, I could be burned at the stake for something which I started because I had to, and which I have tried to stop, but I can't for fear of her going into another withdrawal episode. It's as if I've said I don't love her any more - that's the kind of reaction I get1

I'm starting to want a woman's company too - just someone to take out and talk to - and yes, I do miss sex terribly, but I can't imagine what my daughter would say and do, and even if she was OK about it, which I doubt, what if she wanted me to bath her and ""do her bums - back and front"" while any new partner was down? Or even if she just mentioned it? 

There's another thing which has only recently started to happen. She came into the bathroom when I was in the bath. I usually bathe with the same bathwater as she's had, but with a bit more added. She got in and tried to touch my privates, to ""do yours"" as she put it, but I told her I had to do it. Again she reacted as if I'd said I was leaving home or something. She came in again 2 nights later, and tried again, and I told her No again, and then last night, when I allowed her wash it with soap and that was all there was to it.

","Bathing my 7 year old daughter. 
[Remorse]: If you feel bad 

I'm a widowed single father aged 37 with a 7 year old daughter. My wife and her mother were killed in a car accident nearly 3 years ago, which was obviously devastating for both my little girl and me. I honestly believe that had it not been for my daughter, I would not still be here.

I had great support from family and friends in the first few months, in particular from my sister and my late wife's sister who both looked after my very young girl who was missing her Mummy and Grandma terribly. Things move on though, people have their own families, and in time it was down to me to look after her on my own apart from day care and then school.

It would not be too dramatic to say that we have always had a special relationship because of what we went through following the accident, and my little girl only wanted to be with me and became very ""clingy"" for want of another word. When I went into the garden she would follow, if I went into the bathroom she would follow, she even wanted to stay as I sat on the toilet - which I had to explain was not really the done thing! If I wasn't there for her 24-7 she would cry uncontrollably and then almost shut down emotionally till I returned - it really was quite distressing for me and I should have sought a bit of help back then, but I just pandered to her and hardly went anywhere without her; the odd trip to the supermarket while her auntie was here - I never went out with friends or women.

I HAD to bath her in those days, for safety and to help her clean herself - for any non-parents reading this, 3 year old kids are NOT very aware of their own personal hygeine needs! Something I remember my late wife saying when she bathed her was ""Let's clean your front bum and your back bum"" which she told me was what her own Mother used to say to her when she was little, so I said it;
A; So she knew we had to get those parts clean, and
B; To remind her a little of her Mum, and how she used to bath her.

Now clearly that had to be done at that time, due to her age, but as she got older, 4, 5 and 6 years old, she still wanted me to bath her, and specially to clean her private parts. Now she is just 7 (her birthday was in September) and still she wants me to bath her, and will now specifically ask ""Now do my back bum"", and ""Now do my front bum"". She really loves me to do it, and will say ""Just a bit more, a bit more, OK!""

I'm starting to feel very uncomfortable now, and I've told her that she should do it herself now, but she won't have it, and gets very withdrawn and sad when I have insisted that she does it. I don't want her upset, so I renaged and started to do it for her again. I do feel that, for her, it's a kind of connection to the past when her Mummy used to do it, which she must remember, and she thinks that Dad has to do it now, because Mum's gone. I'm not offended by it, and in all honesty, I would leave it till she didn't ask any more, but I'm a bit worried that, if she should innocently say something about it to a friend, or worse still, a teacher or one of her aunties, I could be burned at the stake for something which I started because I had to, and which I have tried to stop, but I can't for fear of her going into another withdrawal episode. It's as if I've said I don't love her any more - that's the kind of reaction I get1

I'm starting to want a woman's company too - just someone to take out and talk to - and yes, I do miss sex terribly, but I can't imagine what my daughter would say and do, and even if she was OK about it, which I doubt, what if she wanted me to bath her and ""do her bums - back and front"" while any new partner was down? Or even if she just mentioned it? 

There's another thing which has only recently started to happen. She came into the bathroom when I was in the bath. I usually bathe with the same bathwater as she's had, but with a bit more added. She got in and tried to touch my privates, to ""do yours"" as she put it, but I told her I had to do it. Again she reacted as if I'd said I was leaving home or something. She came in again 2 nights later, and tried again, and I told her No again, and then last night, when I allowed her wash it with soap and that was all there was to it. She just dried herself again and smiled at me and went into her bedroom. Before I read her her bedtime story I told her that ""grown ups always clean themselves down there"" but she just said ""I like doing it for you"", and again looked really hurt that I didn't seem to want her to do it.

How the heck am I going to sort this out? If I let it continue, it's ""ICKY"" to quote from the Friends episode, and if I try to stop it, she goes into hibernate mode and won't talk to me.

19428,3657lr,post,No homophobes plz - I feel betrayed but its my fault,"
[Light]: Casual confessions

Right now he's on a date with someone else 5 years older than him. I have no idea what to feel.
I'm currently 17 years old, I'm a boy, and I'm gay. I'm a virgin, and I've never even been kissed. Here's what I have to say -
Until Grade 9, I repressed my feelings towards other boys because my parents are ignorant Catholics who told me since I was little that ""[being gay] is never how God would've wanted it."" (actual words that mother said to me when I was about 6 or 7 years old after seeing a Pride parade on the news.)
I even dated a girl in grade 8 for two days while assuming I was straight. That didn't go over well.
So, I held these beliefs until grade 9, when I finally listened to my common sense and realised that religion is just a giant heaping pile of bullshit (sorry to any religious people reading this, I don't mean to offend), and that being gay was, in fact, okay. This might sound pretty mundane but that was a huge epiphany for me at the time. Today, only my friends know I'm gay.
I had always found some other boys cute since elementary school, but the one that really made me realise I was queer was this boy I met in my grade 9 art class. We'll just call him Neil, he's the same age as me. He's feminine as all heck, he's into fashion, hair and makeup, he's kind of girly. We all knew he was gay, even if he really didn't start coming out until about grade 10. By the end of the year, I was head over heels for him: he was the kind of crush that you wake up thinking about him and you fall asleep thinking about him. Some days I was excited to go to school just to see him for a short while.
I go to a tiny catholic school on the outskirts of our city, and we were the only two gay boys. But, I didn't say anything to him. I was born with mild Asperger's Syndrome, which basically makes me a very awkward person to be around: I always say the wrong things at the wrong times, I'm extra clumsy, I talk either way too fast or I stutter. I can't dance or run if my life depended on it. Flashing lights, loud music, crowds, all terrify me. I don't go to school dances or to parties because, as my fellow Aspies (e.g.: people with Asperger's Syndrome) will know, loud music/noises, and extended socializing like that is the perfect storm. Because of my condition, I could never go up to his face and talk to him about my feelings. So, what was my solution, you ask? Why, like any rational human being, I kept my feelings for him bottled up inside me for 3 years. I only ever got the courage to tell my best friend about my crush about 8 months ago.
This is where it gets raunchy.
Me and Neil are friends, and we Snapchat each other sometimes. About 2 months ago, long story short, we started sending each other nudes. A lot of them. And, to tell the truth, it was amazing. I was on Cloud 9 the whole time. We did this on more than one occasion. Eventually, during one of our ''photography'' sessions, I asked him if he wanted to kiss me at school some time - neither of us had ever kissed anyone before. He said that ""it scares him"" because he ""isn't ready for a boyfriend'', he wants to ''wait until college''. I really didn't care, I was just thrilled I was doing this with him. He even asked me to be his friend with benefits!
Eventually, we became each other's gay best friend. He convinced me to download to Grindr (the gay hookup/chat app) on my iPod.
Because Grindr shows you guys based on how far away they are from you, only fat hairy guys in their 40's were available to me. Neil, who lives some 50 miles away, only got young hot guys in their 20's. I eventually deleted the app, as it served no purpose to me, while Neil chatted with infinite guys in his area. Then, one day, it all stopped. No more nudes, no more sex talk, no more of that stuff. Just a month into it, he had met a guy 5 years older than him on Grindr. Tonight, they went on their first date, and I bet they kissed if they didn't have sex.
Like I said before, I don't know what to feel.
I've had the biggest crush on him for 3 years, and this guy takes him after a few conversations. I feel like I'm constantly being used: the girl I ''dated'' in Grade 8 was just because she wanted to make another boy jealous. Neil used me for about a month because he wanted nudes and to talk about sex until he found someone hotter. Apparently this is all I'm good for - a relationship prop.
I feel like I might be jealous of Neil's perfect life: he has accepting parents who didn't give a flying fuck about his sexuality when he came out, his parents let him wear any outfit or have any hairdo he wants because they don't care if he looks ''gay"" as long as he is being himself, he found a hot boyfriend, he doesn't have Asperger's so he enjoys parties, dances, etc. On the contrary, I have ignorant parents who would make a big deal about me if I came out, my parents are never shy to advise me on how ''gay'' something looks before I buy it (including, but not limited to, buying tea with the tea bag string thing sticking out so people know I'm drinking tea, you know, a boy drinking tea, egad!), I've never even had a romantic conversation with another human being (it's ok, that's what Omegle's for), and my Asperger's prevents me for going to clubs, parties, school dances, school prom, etc.
Deep down, I still have an unstoppable crush on him, even if he's the source of my sadness. How can I forget him when he's the one who made me realise that I'm gay? Because are the only two gay guys in the school, I most likely will not meet another gay guy in 2 - 3 years when I go off to university. Am I that repulsive that Neil had to tell me he was waiting until college before getting a boyfriend instead of being honest with me?
I feel like I've been ready for a relationship for years now, but everything just pushes me back further and further the more I try to find someone to just cuddle me.
I'm scared that one day, when I'm older, I'll have to hire an escort if I want to have sex for the first time. I feel angry, upset, even betrayed. Yet I know it's all my fault because I technically never even asked him out. If I feel angry about someone else's happiness, what does that say of me?
Sorry for writing a book, but I had to get to get this out no matter how petty it is.

I was recently looking at a lot of different threads and sorting them by controversial. I usually found that when a guy takes advantage of a woman he is rightfully condemned. However, I always feel awful because I know I have pressured girls in the past (never anything close to rape.) and I feel guilty. A particular instance comes to mind was last year I was 17 hanging out with a girl in her basement. We are cuddling and I attempt to feel her breasts but she moved my hand back. This is the point where I fuck up. I reach again and she does nothing so I start to feel her breasts. At this point she positions herself closer to me and we kind of start to dry hump. After all this she tells a mutual friend that she did not want any of that to happen. I'm really confused as to why she positioned herself closer to me (ass to dick) when she says she did not want that to happen. I was not holding her down at all. Another time I feel guilty about is that I would basically beg this girl to sext me. The first few times she was enthusiastic then reluctant and it her attitude towards it had basically been switching like that. She later tells me she just wanted to make me happy (we both probably have low self-esteem). I feel bad towards pressuring these girls. I also guess they felt pressure to please me? I am very observant of body language now and I rightfully feel bad for what I've done. The exact posts that made me write this were in r/confessions. One posts details how a man with a fwb relationship pays a girls rent if she agrees to have anal sex with him. She does not enjoy it and people are telling him he raped her. Another posts detailed how some guy got off by explicitly looking for girls who needed money and paying them for various sexual acts (including ones that made them uncomfortable). No one said much bad about him even though the posts are identical. I don't want this post to be like that. I don't understand anymore. I just don't want anybody to have hurt feelings and I don't think I'm a sex offender.

edit:  I sexually assaulted that girl. The contact was unwanted and no consent was given. What this post is about is this: I see myself in those rapists and I'm disgusted. I have definitely changed my behavior so that nothing close to this happens, but I could have been one of them if I had not thought about what I did. This is not a rape apologists post. I realize that those guys had no consideration or thought about what the girl was feeling and just wanted pleasure. I understand that I've had those same thoughts.

19431,2zsu3t,post,"Probably Aspergers. Bullied, molested, and incredibly smart whilst being told daily I was dumb. [No Regrets]","[No Regrets]

I am probably Aspergers. Growing up, I started speaking at a very young age. I was very smart, but my social awkwardness led people to believe that I was dumb. 

At the age of eight, I was molested by a teenager much older than myself. Upon getting caught by his sister, he then convinced her to molest me so that she couldn't get him in trouble. 

Fast forward to junior high. Living in a highly religous area, being socially awkward, and having been molested, I didn't realize it wasn't appropriate to masturbate in the bathroom stalls at school. One day, someone looked under the stalls and caught me; brought in their friend and girlfriend to make fun of me while I was crying, not knowing what to do. This became gossip which spread like wildfire around the school, and the bullying became worse than ever. By day, I was being told constantly that I was retarded; that I was some idiot who couldn't comprehend anything, and a pervert. By night, I was teaching myself how to script maps in starcraft and created my own tower defense map complete with four spawn points, secrets, and over 20 waves of enemies. Dumb? I think not.

Fast forward. High school. It became quite clear that a few good friends of mine were only friends with me because they thought I was dumb. I had a tendency to believe anything anyone told me, not because I wasn't smart, but because the idea of lying about stupid random shit just to upset a ""friend"" seemed so pointless. I put up with it for a while, but eventually stopped hanging out with them altogether. 

This particular group of friends prided themselves on their ability to steal $50 worth of things here and their from local corporations, doing so by running after the beeper went off. After I ditched them, almost as if to prove to them and everyone around me that I wasn't stupid, I became a different sort of thief. Over the course of three months, I stole somewhere around five-thousand dollars worth of goods from corporate stores. These items would then be posted to ebay, whereupon I would reap the profits. 

I stole a playstation two, dozens of boxed-set dvd's, books, games, and even computer parts. The way I managed to get away with it, of course, was the exact opposite of my once-friends. I would consciously make conversation and eye contact with any employee who passed by me. The anti-theft cases were cracked open while sitting in one of the many comfortable reading chairs pretending to read a book under a camera blindspot. The leftover case and plastic wrap was then shoved under the cushion of the chair, and the now-freed item stuffed into a backpack or jacket. 

Eventually, I gave up this habit of mine which had grown into somewhat of an addiction. The last thing I stole was a moleskin journal, thinking ""This will be the last thing you ever steal,"" and so it was. I have no desire to steal things anymore. I think, really, all I wanted to do was to prove I was better than the so-called friends who made fun of me. They never knew about my deeds, of course, but I knew, and that's all that mattered. Out of curiosity, I looked two of them up the other day. One is now a drunk, and the other a sex offender. In hindsight, I am incredibly happy that they treated me so shitty, because I'd hate to be anywhere remotely similar to where they are now. Thank fuck North Carolina is now behind me.","Probably Aspergers. Bullied, molested, and incredibly smart whilst being told daily I was dumb. [No Regrets] [No Regrets]

I am probably Aspergers. Growing up, I started speaking at a very young age. I was very smart, but my social awkwardness led people to believe that I was dumb. 

At the age of eight, I was molested by a teenager much older than myself. Upon getting caught by his sister, he then convinced her to molest me so that she couldn't get him in trouble. 

Fast forward to junior high. Living in a highly religous area, being socially awkward, and having been molested, I didn't realize it wasn't appropriate to masturbate in the bathroom stalls at school. One day, someone looked under the stalls and caught me; brought in their friend and girlfriend to make fun of me while I was crying, not knowing what to do. This became gossip which spread like wildfire around the school, and the bullying became worse than ever. By day, I was being told constantly that I was retarded; that I was some idiot who couldn't comprehend anything, and a pervert. By night, I was teaching myself how to script maps in starcraft and created my own tower defense map complete with four spawn points, secrets, and over 20 waves of enemies. Dumb? I think not.

Fast forward. High school. It became quite clear that a few good friends of mine were only friends with me because they thought I was dumb. I had a tendency to believe anything anyone told me, not because I wasn't smart, but because the idea of lying about stupid random shit just to upset a ""friend"" seemed so pointless. I put up with it for a while, but eventually stopped hanging out with them altogether. 

This particular group of friends prided themselves on their ability to steal $50 worth of things here and their from local corporations, doing so by running after the beeper went off. After I ditched them, almost as if to prove to them and everyone around me that I wasn't stupid, I became a different sort of thief. Over the course of three months, I stole somewhere around five-thousand dollars worth of goods from corporate stores. These items would then be posted to ebay, whereupon I would reap the profits. 

I stole a playstation two, dozens of boxed-set dvd's, books, games, and even computer parts. The way I managed to get away with it, of course, was the exact opposite of my once-friends. I would consciously make conversation and eye contact with any employee who passed by me. The anti-theft cases were cracked open while sitting in one of the many comfortable reading chairs pretending to read a book under a camera blindspot. The leftover case and plastic wrap was then shoved under the cushion of the chair, and the now-freed item stuffed into a backpack or jacket. 

Eventually, I gave up this habit of mine which had grown into somewhat of an addiction. The last thing I stole was a moleskin journal, thinking ""This will be the last thing you ever steal,"" and so it was. I have no desire to steal things anymore. I think, really, all I wanted to do was to prove I was better than the so-called friends who made fun of me. They never knew about my deeds, of course, but I knew, and that's all that mattered. Out of curiosity, I looked two of them up the other day. One is now a drunk, and the other a sex offender. In hindsight, I am incredibly happy that they treated me so shitty, because I'd hate to be anywhere remotely similar to where they are now.

19432,2yv7mg,post,I'm HIV positive (likely) and ashamed.[Tough Love],"[Remorse]: If you feel bad 

I first became aware of my condition after the signs began to manifest following an exposure to blood of an unknown origin in a public restroom. Following my accidental contact, I ended up touching my genitals and other mucous membranes without noticing that I'd had contact with the blood spill - this would be the first of many mistakes. Within mere weeks from doing this, I'd begin to suffer flu-like symptoms (cold chills, fever, rash, and constipation), but I'd notice that my malaise was of an especially heightened level not common for a simple viral infection. Googling my symptoms revealed that my bizarre outburst of medical problems might have a more insidious origin - every detail about my symptoms fits within the framework of this diagnosis (i.e. the location of the rash, intensity of symptoms, and time period of infection). (If you are wondering ""how did you decide to fixate on HIV as the cause?,"" PM me for the specific details of this circumstance. For the purpose of this case, let's just say that I know of an HIV-positive individual in my general vicinity who used the restroom right before I did and might be responsible for leaving the blood.) Oh, and finally, sexual transmission *is not* an option in my case - I'm a virgin, and I haven't ever had a romantic partner before.

I feel like such an idiot for landing myself in this situation, and if I'm correct, then I've ended up with one of the world's deadliest STDs without even participating in sexual acts. Whenever someone attempts to hug me or give me a handshake, I try my hardest to find a way of escaping the situation without touching them - I realize that I cannot transmit the virus via casual contact, but I still don't want to take any risks. I feel as if I'm putting others at risk by merely being around them (even though I'm obviously not having sex with anyone), and I am worried to death about this situation. My family and friends aren't aware of what I am, but I cannot imagine they'd react well to knowing. If I am truly HIV+, then my life will be miserable from this point on: I'll never be able to date, marry, or have children at any point. My entire life will be dedicated to the reproduction cycle of a retrovirus, and the virus will be present in every tear I shed and every drop of blood I release. Many Middle-Eastern countries just deal with the problem of HIV by quarantining HIV+ individuals for life, and although we do not practice that sort of behavior in this country, I cannot argue with the core methodology. At the moment, I feel guilty every time I laugh, spend time with family, or enjoy life - what right do I have to do any of those things? I'm a danger to everyone around me, and if I survive this whole thing, no one will ever believe my story.

19433,2wjvie,post,[Remorse] I was raped and it hasn't really affected me,"[Remorse]: If you feel bad

Well, when I was a young teen I met an older guy and we got along really well. At the time I didn't know enough to think it was strange for a 20-something year old man to be friends or even flirt with me; I thought it meant I was really mature or something. I know now of course that he was sick for preying on a young girl but for some reason I'm not filled with rage or anything. I literally feel nothing when I think about what happened, as if I can acknowledge that it was wrong but still not care... 

He had sex with me when I said no, but when I imagine that he could have infected me with something, gotten me pregnant, or murdered me, I just think that I'm lucky. I hear horrible stories from or about other rape victims and feel very sorry for them in a way I don't feel sorry for myself. I feel guilty that I get to go on living a normal life while they are scarred for the rest of theirs. 

When it happened I didn't tell anyone and by time I did, it was too late to prove anything. I even tried and it just didn't hold up, which I know is because I didn't speak up. I was just like, ""wow. That was a close one."" I feel as if I got off easily because he didn't try to hurt me; he just didn't stop. 

I'm 18 now and very, very normal. I mean, I'm a very sexual person and maybe this has had something to do with it (I have had rape role play fantasies in the past) but I was sexual before it happened, too. I feel like it hasn't changed me very much at all and while I'm glad it hasn't, I feel guilty. I feel awful for rape victims no matter what their story is but for ME, I don't feel bad. I wish that I could take away their pain and suffering and I feel slightly ashamed that I can have a normal life while some victims contemplate suicide.

[No Regrets]: If you don't feel bad 



Ok so i'm just going to bitch for my own closure and sorting out what just happened and you guys can just read, If i say anything to offend anyone i apologize in advance.

Ok so for a few years now i've been curious about sleeping with a guy. I watched the porn and questioned my sexuality about my thoughts and fantasies, and thought to myself one day it'll happen and then we'll know. Well it happened, and i wasn't a fan.

So it started off last night i was in a really horny mood grabbed my ... and double clicked for all the porn i could find and then the adventurous side of my brain woke up and pointed me to craigs list and next thing i knew i was emailing this guy in the same situation as me, curious and wanting to experiment.

So the next day happens and we're still emailing and we arrange to meet at stupid oclock in the morning and see what happens. luckily he was a really nice guy shy and kind hearted. Any guy would be lucky to have him as a partner. Anyway many things happened and we end up there lying on the bed, a touch bemused with what just went down.

It was at this moment I realized that I'm really not gay. Ok so it took sex with a stranger to help me realize and i'd be lying if some bits werent interesting but those questions have been put to rest. Personally sex with guys is crap and there's no beauty in it for me. Ok so inexperience will have played a part but at the base of it, it didn't feel right for me, and was actually kinda dull compared to sex with women. Regardless i've got to be thankful for the experience otherwise i would have spent forever wondering what it might be like.

So yea there's my confession.

I guess you could use this as proof against all those people that say being gay is a choice. It's really not.

19435,2vh2er,post,I never took care of it. (trigger warning),"[Remorse]: If you feel bad 

When I was younger, I was stupid and into hard drugs. One day, I was hanging out with my best friend at the time, her boyfriend, and his drug dealer friend. We all were hanging out and having a good time doing drugs. Eventually, my friend and her boyfriend went to the other room.


While we were alone, he offered me an ounce to have sex with him, but I said no. I didn't trust him and I had a bad feeling about him. I didn't want to be alone with him.. He took off his shirt and moved to sit by me, trapping me against the wall. He had a swastika tattooed on his chest. He told me I was pretty and said I'd like it. He forced my pants off and tried to lick me, but I wriggled back so he just used his hands instead. I started hyperventilating and crying, but I couldn't scream. I couldn't kick. It literally just wasn't happening. I was a teenage girl and this was a 6'2 skin head drug dealer. 


He didn't stop when I ask and when he was taking his pants off, I screamed, finally. After he got that far. He covered my mouth and said he was sorry. Pulled his pants back up and tried to dress me, but I freaked out and dressed myself. My friend said I was pale looked like I had seen a ghost.


I asked her boyfriend to take me to school now and he did. MY friend and him told me I was overreacting when I told them on the drive. I went to school and sat in class for about five minutes before I asked to be excused. I went to the bathroom and looked at the bruises on my thighs and started crying. I couldn't stop. 



My friend decided to give my attempted rapist my phone number and address. ""So he could explain"" said my friend. He really used the opportunity to stalk and terrorize me. Until I ran away from home. 


When I finally reported him six month later, I found out he was already a registered sex offender. But since I waited so long, there were no bruises, my friend still supported him and thought I was misunderstanding his intentions and told the cops I looked scared but they heard and saw nothing and didn't believe me. My friend at school that had seen the bruises was supportive, but they told me it was a really weak case and they would see if they could get him to plead out. I got discouraged and never pursued it after that. 



Later, I saw him in jail for failure to register. HE's been in and out for that but no one has reported him again or it hasn't stuck, like mine. I feel so much guilt. I'm sure he's done it again. I could have protected other women, but I didn't. I ran away again.","I never took care of it. (trigger warning) [Remorse]: If you feel bad

19436,2uvat9,post,I want to be raped,"[remorse]

Throwaway account.

I am sorry for offending anyone. I know this is despicable. I understand that this sounds like I am downplaying the experience of rape victims. I get it if you're upset with these types of posts. 

I'm just going to be honest and then I will move on. I'm 20 years old and I'm a woman. I'm sleep-deprived, depressed, stressed, and I don't know what to do with myself other than to write this. So on to the confession...

I was coerced into sex when I was in kindergarten by a family member who was only slightly older than me. I didn't know what was going on, but I was led into a room and things went from there. Although it may not be rape by most people since he was just a child, it still is traumatic for me. I regret not stopping it and I regret feeling pleasure. I have horrible flashbacks where I try to ""physically"" stop the memories from coming back (scream, squeeze myself). This person grew up to be very violent in the house (not towards me) but he has since ""changed"" (sort of). I was close to killing him once.

Fast-forward...

My desire to be raped is a combination of many things. I also understand that wanting to be rape doesn't make sense because rape means to take against your will. I can't explain that.

The first reason is, I watch a lot of rape videos. Real and fake. I fantasize about rape a lot. I also get turned on by violence, but it has to be a guy hitting a girl. The video doesn't even have to be sexual. Seeing women cry after a guy hurts her turns me on. I realized this years ago when I was in high school when I saw a Youtube video of a man punching this girl really hard in the face, and then throwing her out of the room. I remember getting turned on by this a lot. Since then, this is all I watch as porn.

The second reason is, I have nothing going for me in my life. I hate my house, I hate my family, I hate school, I hate my existence, I hate what I look like, I hate what I've become, I hate everything. My anxieties are absolutely terrible. I almost had a job but I backed out. I'm going to school online because I couldn't stand commuting and being on campus, or communicating with people. I push everyone away.

I used to want to die, but I no longer think like that only because there is a spark of hope inside of me that thinks things will get better. But right now, there's nothingness in my life and it depresses me. It is strange that I don't have a stronger desire to die. 

The only thing I can compare this to are those who self-harm. People feel numb on the outside because they feel nothing but pain in the inside so they cut themselves to feel ""something"". Getting raped would bring some sort of ""something"" in my life that I think I need. I can finally have a real experience of some sort. I can cry about something, and go to support groups with people who were raped, go to therapy, transform into someone better. Actually have a story.

I feel too pathetic to finish this confession. I'm sorry everyone.

19437,2uq86u,post,Trapped,"[Remorse]  

Ok Reddit, I'm pulling out all of the stops on this one. It's a combo confession+wtf do I do now post. In all honesty, I know there really isn't any advice which can be given, and I don't want sympathy. I'm just... so... stuck.  




Over a decade ago, I molested a member of my family. I don't make excuses for myself; I was appalled then as I am now. I was convicted and served jail time - during which, I did a fair amount of reading, trying to understand where this came from. After I was released, I attended the court-mandated counselling, and have since voluntarily attended different therapy groups in search of understanding; this was not the person I ever wanted to be. I have spent the last decade in search of personal betterment - I owe it to my victim to prevent it from happening again.  

After a few years, I was stable enough to function again. I found myself gainfully employed, and was picking up where I left off in my education. I excelled at this job - customers asked for me by name. The problem, however, arose when my employer looked into my background (a background check was not required when I got the job), and promptly fired me with payment in lieu of notice. Since then, I have not been able to find *any* stability in work or home.  

As of the date of my conviction, it was possible to obtain a pardon, and thereby become a functional member of society again - the laws have since changed to completely exclude sex offenders from any form of pardon.

I want nothing more than to work, to do a good job - *to do whatever good I can to offset the evil I've committed* - instead, I feel I'm left with very few options. The options I feel that I have left to me don't seem to contribute much positivity to the world;  

* live on welfare (I am capable of, but not 'allowed' to work)  
* go back to jail (I couldn't bring myself to do this)  
* do my best to dissolve (whatever that means)  
  
What point is there in releasing sex offenders from incarceration if there is *no chance* of reintegrating us into society?  ","Trapped [Remorse]

I have spent the last decade in search of personal betterment - I owe it to my victim to prevent it from happening again.  

After a few years, I was stable enough to function again. I found myself gainfully employed, and was picking up where I left off in my education. I excelled at this job - customers asked for me by name. The problem, however, arose when my employer looked into my background (a background check was not required when I got the job), and promptly fired me with payment in lieu of notice. Since then, I have not been able to find *any* stability in work or home.  

As of the date of my conviction, it was possible to obtain a pardon, and thereby become a functional member of society again - the laws have since changed to completely exclude sex offenders from any form of pardon.

I want nothing more than to work, to do a good job - *to do whatever good I can to offset the evil I've committed* - instead, I feel I'm left with very few options. The options I feel that I have left to me don't seem to contribute much positivity to the world;  

* live on welfare (I am capable of, but not 'allowed' to work)  
* go back to jail (I couldn't bring myself to do this)  
* do my best to dissolve (whatever that means)  
  
What point is there in releasing sex offenders from incarceration if there is *no chance* of reintegrating us into society?  ",1,4.0,2015-02-04 5:54,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/2uq86u/trapped/,Neutral

I love the colors pink and purple, I listen to sugar-soaked pop music (Kylie, Britney). I am 5'6"" and maintain a skinny figure, and while I'm on the treadmill or elliptical for hours I watch typically girly shows like Real Divas and Say Yes to the Dress. I have a high voice and sing a solid tenor. I can't stomach beer but will frequently drink things like Mike's Hard Lemonade or Smirnoff Ice. I drive a cute little two-seater sports car (purple). I have zero male friends and quickly lose interest in ""dude things."" I'd much rather play with a cute puppy than watch football.

In my free time I work on music, draw, write, and fold origami. I've been told I have a ""girl's face"" and past girlfriends have loved dressing me up. I've had fun with it too.

Sexually I am totally submissive and sometimes enjoy being taken in the ass with a strap on.

Many times I've wondered, ""hm, am I gay?"" It seems like all of the signs are there, yet I feel absolutely no attraction toward men. It's not an ""afraid to come out of the closet"" kind of situation. I just prefer women in every sense. I love how breasts bounce during sex, I love how a woman's ass looks while she's bent over and I'm fucking her. I love eating pussy.

And you know what? After a lot of soul-searching, I have decided I'm ok with that. For most of my life, I've felt that I've had to ""man it up"" if I ever wanted to be socially accepted. I have tried dressing more like a typical dude, drinking ""burrrr"" like a typical dude, pretending to be more dominant sexually... and I'm sick of it. I'm happy being myself, no matter what conflicting stereotypes that person presents.

Since I have accepted who I am, I have fallen into a healthy and happy relationship with an awesome girl (a year strong now) who likes getting fucked as much as she likes putting me in a skirt and makeup and fucking me in the ass. We like the same music and she enjoys how petite I am. And even if I didn't have her, I'd still have me, the same weird purple pop-loving man-princess that I've always been.

**Edit/Sidebar**:  For those somehow offended by my use of the word ""gay"" even though I know I am heterosexual, please understand that where I grew up (a close-minded backward hellhole of a place), that word was often thrown at me not only to define my behavior, but also to condemn me for my actions.  During my childhood I decided to appropriate it for myself and embrace it, and instead of feeling hated I could redefine the word to something positive.  I understand there are a lot of gender and sexual identity politics involved with the term and that I'm somehow ""reinforcing"" a bad situation, but please don't be offended by how somebody chooses to define *themselves*.  If I'm calling somebody else ""gay"" for having feminine interests, that is a very different thing than me using the term to define myself.  My reality is my own and nobody else's.  <3","I am the gayest dude this side of San Francisco, yet I loveeeee women. [No Regrets]: If you don't feel bad

19439,2qlr1w,post,i'm pretty much an alcoholic hiding an emotional/sexual complex..,"[Remorse]:

i think i have a complex- i'm 28, never really dated anyone, have a history of depression and my 5-15 drink/day habit maaaay be becoming problematic. apologies in advance for the long post, trying to condense like 18 years of issues into a few paragraphs..

as a kid i was always hyper-sensitive and totally insecure. when i was 9 i told my dad i crush on this girl and he freaked out at me, yelling that i was too young; i felt really bad about that. my dad died of cancer two months after that (the first of eight deaths in the family spanning until i turned 20). i knew absolutely nothing about sex, and tried twice between the ages of 10-12 to ask my mom about it. both times she totally avoided the question. then at 13 i put a sexy (but non-porn) picture of a girl in lingerie as by desktop wallpaper. Mom freaked out and told me never to look at pics like that, and that i didn't respect women.

that summer i was at a YMCA camp and witnessed this kid in my cabin coerce a mentally-challenged boy to suck his dick for play money.. the kid was removed, cops were called, all the kids present were questioned.. so by this point basically everything remotely related to sex that has found its way to my life experiences always seemed to have this horrible context surrounding it.

so after this my difficulties fitting in at school were compounded. at this point i just kind of said 'fuck the human race' and became even more anti-social; it was high school so sexuality was everywhere and i was totally uncomfortable with it, other peoples' and my own. i was starting to notice guys as well as girls by this point.

i dropped out my last year of high school (age 18), was just fed up with everything, really bored, frustrated, and unhappy. after dropping out i started telling people i was bisexual. i met a guy (a year younger than me) online and met up with him. that was my first sexual experience, lost my virginity to a dude in a bathroom stall. pretty ashamed of that. tried alcohol and weed for the first time a couple months later.

two years passed before i had sex again. dropped ecstasy with my best friend (guy), yada yada sex happened. over the next 4 years i had a few (~3/year) drug/alcohol-fueled encounters with 4 different guys and one girl (a threesome with a guy+his girlfriend (my only experience with a girl to date) and a threesome with the same guy and another guy). then a friend and me hooked up (we always drank and tripped together, which kind of facilitated this) a few times. i had never even thought of him like that before he brought it up but it ended up happening, and a few more times after that. i'm pretty sure he had genuine feelings for me but i never really acknowledged that when he talked about it, to me it was kind of just.. sex i guess.

-- so now --

i eventually wrote my high school equivalency (scored 99%) and now i'm in my fourth year of an undergraduate neuroscience degree (with no future in mind). i'm turning 28 tomorrow. haven't had any sexual encounters with anyone since that thing with my friend 3 years ago (he doesn't hang out with our group of friends anymore). in retrospect i can safely say i feel totally humiliated by my sexual history, i have no desire to go through that again. i've always felt this attraction to girls, but i grew up thinking that offended my parents, so i've never explored that much. i always thought if i couldn't talk to my mom about girls i definitely couldn't ever actually get involved in a relationship (i still live with my mom and we have never once talked about anything regarding dating or me having a gf).. over the years there have been girls who have tried to get close to me but i never knew how to respond.. like i'm unsure how to form an emotional connection with someone.

i've been taking 5-15+ drinks every day for the last 5 or 6 years, it's starting to take a toll on me (sleeping all day sometimes, not going to classes, twitching and shaking a lot of the time). i would love to just start at the beginning with a basic relationship with someone (just getting to know someone- nothing physical) and just go on a date. i have friends and a social life now (compared to my school days, although my drinking i think has caused my friends to increasingly keep their distance lately) but i think they all see that i have issues with family history and sexuality, so no one ever brings it up.

i'm sure this seems rambling and pointless.. i've omitted a lot of detail for sake of brevity and it's hard to create a coherent narrative with so much i want to put out there.. i'm planning on talking to a counsellor at school and this is sort of my rough draft of what to say.. can anyone make any sense of this? is there anything i can clarify or expand on or omit when trying to turn this into a conversation with a real person?

tl;dr awkward childhood caused me to avoid basic emotional relationships with people in pursuit of uncomfortable drug/alcohol-fuelled sex encounters. now i'm a lonely drunk with no desire for sex.

19440,2pvpj1,post,Bad day at work.,"[Remorse]: As a Medical Laboratory Scientist, I perform testing on patients' blood and body fluids. Most of the work is behind the scenes, you probably won't know I exist.

These past couple days have been bad. Not only are the number of patients are high, but the difficulties of the testing have increased - there are more sick people than usual.

Yesterday in Blood Bank, I had a warm auto antibodies. Well, I had a warm auto antibody, another patient with cold alloantibody, and about 20 patients who needed blood and I made sure everybody got compatible blood. Took me 8 hours to finish the cold alloantibody, and almost finished with the warm auto. Since I am new to Blood Bank, I just followed the procedures. I could either solve for the warm auto antibody, which is A LOT of work, or send it out. This was an outpatient, so I would need him to come back to the hospital to give me more blood so I can send it out. I decided to work on it, get the blood ready for him to be transfused since he has a condition that need blood transfusion. Anyway, I didn't quite finish all the work up; I let the next shift know about the situation. As I found out this morning, the person working the next shift wants to send it out, but there's not enough blood to work on it. She is very upset that I didn't finish working on that patient; basically I wasted precious plasma but didn't finish solving for the antibody. I was so close to finishing; I phenotyped the patient, and the next step is to screen the units for antigen negative and crossmatch it. I simply ran out of time in 8 hours.

My mistakes were: I ran out of time so I didn't put the phenotype results in the computer. I didn't crossmatch it. My Blood bank supervisor had to repeat all of my work, with the same results. She was upset as well, because the patient was to be transfused this morning, but she had to reschedule for later in the afternoon. Also, I didn't communicate in writing about the conditions of the patients and what work-ups I did. I feel bad, because of my inexperience, and the difference in working style between me and the next shift: I wanted to finish working on the problem and she wanted to send it to a reference lab. I know what to do from now on: finish my shit, and don't delegate it to the next person. I feel bad talking to her; I left tonight and didn't have the courage to say hi to her. I know she's upset with me.

Anyway, that's what happened yesterday. Today I work in Urinalysis and Coagulation. So many urines to work on. There was one from ER who was dehydrated. The lab technician got from the nurse a urine tube with less than 1 mL of urine and told the nurse he needs to collect more. He called me and said you guys can do it with that, you do the test and put in the comment that the urine was not optimal volume and testing might be affected or some crap you guys put. OK? I felt offended, but let it go because of the sake of the patient, and I understand he's probably under a lot of pressure also.

In the middle of all this, another nurse orders an ACT test. Activated Clotting Time. I have to go to the patient's bedside and do this test. I checked the QC, and it hasn't been done. It's also a new lot of cartridge reagent. I am going to have to reconstitute QC material, which takes 30 minutes. That's 30 minutes I don't have while the nurses scream at me ""What the hell is taking you so long"". See, I understand that they don't have to worry about QC because it's not part of their job to know, but to me, QC is everything. Because the lab is so quantifiable, it's so easy to get fined. QC/QA is the only way to protect ourselves and the patients by ensuring the testing is done properly. Whatever. I reconstituted the QC, and went to dinner. I went through the whole lab earlier asking my coworkers what smoothie drinks they would like; I was going to go pick them up during my dinner break. I drove to the smoothie store, pick them up, and drove back. My car died 2 miles from the hospital. I was so annoyed and angry. I called my dad and my brother. My brother can swing by and give me a ride to the hospital since I am really late from the dinner break. My dad will come and see what's wrong with my car. God bless my family!

I came back with the drinks. However, in 30 minutes there are a shit ton of urines and blood for me to do. Oh, and the nurses and yelling about the ACT, why is it taking so long, why aren't I there yet. I had to explain again that I needed to do QC; she still didn't get it and scoffed it off ""Well, get here as soon as you can"". I performed the QC testing, then nurses from ER called on the mountains of Urines that I am working on. I got through all that urines, and finished the ACT QC, then went to the patient's bedside to do the test. 20 minutes later, I came back, and there were another mountain of urines. Meanwhile, my dad is texting me nonstop about the battery, when and how long ago was it, etc. While all this pandamonium is going on, in the back of my mind I was still anxious about my mistake in the Blood Bank.

10:30 PM come. I get to go home! But wait, the next shift coworker has car trouble and won't be here until 11. And another ACT is ordered! This test has to be done right away this time. I went up there, the nurse was ready, I was ready, I was done in 10 minutes. I came back, 10:45. 15 minutes of over time. I can explain this one, because there was nobody else to take my place. I walked by the Blood Bank, still a bit ashamed to peek in and say hi to the lady.

I got out, called my brother, he came and picked me up. His gf was in  the passenger seat. They smelled like sex. Whatever. He drove me to my car; the AAA driver was already there. He towed me and my car to my parents' house. Their neighbor is a mechanic and he'll take a look at it in the morning.

I called my friend to come pick me up and bring me to a party. All of my middle school friends. I got some tacos at the party. Everybody was leaving. We were all singing karaoke badly. I started to have feelings for my friend. Snapped out of it though, because I have a girlfriend.

FUCK. FUCCCCKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK.

Let's do it again on Sunday when I have to work Night shift.

All this might be too sciency. I just had a bad day at work. Most notable though: my feeling of inadequacy in Blood Bank, and my car dying. Dead. Also, I notice I switch tense when I write. Sorry, it gets distracting and annoying, I know, but I'm translating all of this from another language in my head. I think in English, but some of it is in my mother tongue.

EDIT: I still haven't heard back from medical schools. A few of them rejected me, the rest is taking their sweet time. I got a call from one of them today, but they needed clarification on one of the recommendation letter. Got my hope up a little from their call, but then it wasn't a call to let me know I've been invited for an interview. This waiting sucks! I hope the Military Medical School accepts me; I've always wanted to be a doctor, and especially one in the Navy. I get to do humanitarian missions with them.

19441,2lg13q,post,[Tough Love] Having an affair with my boss who is twice my age,"[No Regrets] I started working at a restaurant a few months ago. This place is so weird. No, not weird, massively fucked up. The 50yr old boss/cook fucks an 18yr old girl, who is even more insane than him. But that’s not what’s actually fucked up. What’s fucked up is that I wanted to fuck The other boss from the beginning. I didn’t think he wanted me until the time he drove me home and asked for a hug and grabbed my ass. Whats fucked up is that I should be offended and file for sexual harassment, but im TURNED ON. Every week he would drive me home and grab my ass again, then it would get more and more intense to the point when I sucked his dick and he fingered my pussy. what’s fucked up is that Im getting turned on just by writing this. What the hell is wrong with me? Hes 45 im 21. Hes more than twice my age and has a wife and two kids. AND i have a boyfriend that ive been with for 5 years. Today he came over and we did dirty stuff for 10 mins and then he had to leave. He texted me two hours later “I think im getting old!!! I might have a heartattack! ! Your too young. My heart is still beating!!!” What’s that even supposed to mean? Is he in love with me or just astonished that he has a younger girl that wants him. He hasn’t even fucked me. When I suck his dick he cums 10 seconds later. He’s afraid to have sex with me. Probably because he knows it’s gonna last two seconds before he cums and then its gonna be awkward. What’s fucked up is that I know that’s whats gonna happen but I want him anyway. Whats fucked up? Me.
Im scared that this will end terribly wrong. But it’s so incredibly exciting. let me know what you think.","[Tough Love] Having an affair with my boss who is twice my age [No Regrets] I started working at a restaurant a few months ago.

19442,2kwj7v,post,I am a 32yo pedophile who hates his life and thinks about suicide a lot,"
[Remorse]: If you feel bad 

I am attracted to boys. I have a lot of 'friends' who are boys but I am trying to separate myself from them. I tried making friends my own age but other insecurities come up in me. I even tried finding other pedophiles but almost all of them are sex offenders or into girls. I feel so alone. It's like I am suppose to stay away from boys but when I do I feel lonely. Then I try reaching out to others and feel even more lonely. Of course I can't go see a psychologist without assuming the risk of being reported and having to be careful with what I say to avoid misunderstanding. Like if I mentioned that a 9yo boy sat on my lap, I don't want him or her running to CPS saying that I 'abused' him.

what I would give to make a friend around my age and struggles with being attracted to boys!

Sometimes I feel like shooting myself in the head.","I am a 32yo pedophile who hates his life and thinks about suicide a lot

19443,2hr64j,post,I am attracted to children,"[Remorse]: Let me first make this clear; I am not a pedophile. I am attracted to a very wide age group. I am attracted to 8 year old girls much like I am attracted to 40 year old women. The difference is: It's okay to be attracted to older women. It's fucked up to be attracted to a child.

I'm 21. I've been attracted to children since I was 14. My best theory is that since I felt defenseless and constrained during this time, I project these feelings onto others; in this case, children. When I was 14, I was taken from my mom and put into a group home by DCF. I was lied to about why I was taken away. My mother told me it was because she was dating a sex offender (which was true). I began hating DCF because I thought I shouldn't have been taken away from my mother for such a ludicrous reason. As a result, I was thrown into a group home and became suicidally depressed. I had no control over what was happening and I felt like K from The Trial; I didn't believe the reason for why I was taken and no one was divulging more to me. I believe these feelings of helplessness are what began my attraction toward children, who display similar traits. 

The real reason I was taken out is because my sister, who was 7 at the time, accused me of molesting her. Let me make this clear: She's a liar and a sociopath. I never once touched her (and why would I lie here?). She accused other men of molesting her as well but because I was her brother (half-brother to be specific), the state had to take the issue more seriously with me. I completely understand this and had I been told the truth when I was taken, I would not have harbored the intense hatred I had for the state then. I believe my mother lied to me so as not to put more distance between me and my sister. See, my sister is a fucking psycho, and at 7, she was in state custody because of how insane she was. My mother wanted her back and if I didn't cooperate with the little shit, getting her back would have made the ordeal more difficult. I found out the truth a couple years after my mother died, so I couldn't vent my frustration too much.

Now that context is out of the way I can get to the meat of my confession. I am attracted to children around 8 and up. The girl could be 7 or 8; age isn't a huge benchmark for me. There is a point when the girl looks too young for me to get excited down there. My attraction aside, I've never molested/touched a child, nor have I watched child porn. I have stumbled upon it by accident while browsing /b/, but I didn't save it, as much as I wanted to. I think if I ever touched a child, I would kill myself. I wouldn't be able to live with the guilt. It's no secret then that I think pedophiles, not just molesters, but pedophiles in general, are complete trash; and that includes me. I hate myself for my attraction toward young girls. I know full well it's fucked up and if I could stop it, I would. What a lot of people don't understand is that pedophiles can't help their attraction toward children. It's hard-wired into us. I'm positive that 99.9% of pedophiles would get rid of this defect if they could. 

While I don't watch CP, I do skimp around the edges. My urges can become strong, and I'm not going to go child watching in the park. To satisfy my urges, I use 4 things. 

- Jailbait videos. I have a lot of videos of young girls acting like sluts/dancing. Videos young girls uploaded onto Youtube. I don't feel as much shame with this stuff because the girls personally uploaded them. At least they weren't taken advantage of or abused. 

- Child model videos. Mainly Candydoll. This is what I feel most ashamed of. Candydoll is a Japanese company that makes modelling videos of young girls, often in erotic clothing. They're not naked but occasionally, if the clothing is tight enough, you can see their slit down there. It's fucked up I look at this stuff.

- Loli Hentai Anime. These are just drawings so no harm is being done here.

- Loli Hentai Manga. Same as above. 

Let me reiterate that I'm not just attracted to children. The videos of children I have make up about 20% of the porn I view. 80% of it is adult porn. I am more attracted to adults than children but like any fetish, sometimes you just have that urge, and children are that urge for me.

19444,2cfagj,post,[Light] My parents are actually siblings,"[Light]: Casual confessions

At first, I didn't want to believe it. I wish I never did look at the old photographs in the attic. I was just looking for my childhood things one day but found a shoe box with a few pictures. I first thought the pictures of my parents as kids were cute, they grew up together and that's why they were always together in the pictures. Then I saw 1, then 2, then 3 pictures of my parents family. In all those pictures, my grandparents were the same two people. Then the family picture...

I imagine this is a similar situation as if you found out your neighbor is actually a registered sex offender after being great friends with them. 

If it weren't for finding those pictures, I would never have guessed they were siblings. Yes, they look the same but have two different types of personalities. My Dad is kind of strict but never does yell. My mom is the fun mom who I love to share my secrets with and joke around with. They both have the same hair, same eyes, and now that I think about it, the same nose sort of. They let me date whoever and I love them both.

NOBODY knows about this. I'm sure because I've never heard any rumors and we attend church every Sunday. My friends love my parents. Surely, someone would tell me or have given us weird looks but no...

Now I know why my parents don't talk about my grandparents or we don't see them.

Maybe one day I will tell them, but for now I'm happy they get along with one-another and don't want anything to change right now.","[Light] My parents are actually siblings [Light]: Casual confessions

19445,250lz6,post,[Uncomfortable] I have Asperger's and people get pissed off when I tell them I want to be normal and don't want to be like other people with disabilities,"For the record, I'm close to graduating college, I've tried nine different anti-depressants, I've talked to three therapists, and I still want to die.  I always feel left out, even by my friends, and I've never had a girlfriend in my life (i'm ugly as fuck)  That being said:

People look down on me, they view me as weird and different.  When I'd talk to my therapists or my mom (who works with people with disabilities) they'd tell me to find groups of people who are more ""tolerant"" and I'd feel like they'd try to shame me when I'd assert that I just want to be normal. Lots of people with Asperger's are happy going to anime club or whatever once a week and that's what they consider a fun social life.  When I asserted that maybe I want normal college friends who party and get drunk and do dumb shit (I have friends like that, for now at least) they'd tell me things like ""oh, maybe that isn't the right setting for you"" as if ""fitting in"" is more important than doing things that I like.

People used to tell me to make friends with other people with Asperger's but the thing is that I really don't like people with Asperger's.  Almost all of the ones I've met are impolite, painfully boring, averse to doing fun things (""Wanna go to a party or something?""  ""No, I'd like to jerk off and play Sonic the Hedgehog.""), narcissistic (the paradigm in Asperger's education is that you're fine the way you are and anyone who doesn't like or even understand you is ""intolerant"" or ""shallow""), and/or awkward to the point of being uncomfortable to hang out with.  Sorry if that offended anyone but if you have Asperger's and that doesn't describe then it shouldn't.  People always say ""OH THAT'S NOT NICE"" when I tell them that but I don't give a shit.  I judge all people on their own merits and it just so happens that most spergs I've met are severely lacking in merit. (not that I'm any better)

My therapists used to tell me stuff like ""oh, I know people with Downs Syndrome who are perfectly happy"" I tell them that I, God forbid, don't want to be like people with Downs Syndrome who work in a factory and have no experience with sexuality beyond getting jerked off by their retarded housemate (my mom's specialty is ""disability and sexuality"" and this is honestly a typical Downs sex life), they act like I'm saying some awful thing about other people.  Sorry I want to live a normal life.

I told my former therapist, a self-proclaimed autism expert (he had no real credentials dealing with people with autism, besides being pretty damn spergy himself) that I feel shitty girls don't like me and if a girl wanted to date me she'd probably be as ugly and retarded as I am.  He told me ""oh, just look for someone nice"" so I laughed at his face and pointed at the Sigma Alpha Epsilon plaque on his desk and asked him if he spent his college days chasing after ""nice"" girls with his frat bros. 

My mom told me that she thinks I should tell people I have Asperger's so they'll be more ""understanding"" and I ended up yelling at her and asking her how the same person who taught me to always live up to the consequences of my actions could possibly tell me to go around making excuses for shitty behavior.  I guess when I was a kid she underestimated how retarded I am.

19446,24l5v1,post,[Help] I revisited forgotten memories of what I did. Went from happiest person on earth to feeling like I only deserve to live in misery for the rest of time,"I lost most of my memories pre16 after a decade of mental and sexual abuse. After that I spent another 6 or so years in a different but also abusive situation, and finally found happiness and stability in all aspects of my life. Two days ago I went to look back at the things I did when I was 15, and it's completed destroyed who I am.
  
I don't feel like I deserve to be happy anymore. I regret that I ever was able to be happy. It all makes sense now... For two decades I kept asking, why in the universe are all these horrible things happening to me? Well, it's because I deserve it for what I did (and what I had forgotten I did). Someone please kill me, and feel no guilt...
  
... At 15-16 I broke from all the stuff I went through--I seriously went insane. I stopped caring about everything, let a child sex offender have his way with me for the longest time, and... all of my pent up anger in life.... I let it all out on the one person who had ever treated me with love and respect, a boyfriend of four years. I would let this offender do these things with me (yes sexual) and then go tell the only person that loved me every gruesome detail, rubbing it in his face.
  
But I knew all that. I just didnt realize how horrible it really was.
  
... My boyfriend spent every moment of every day pouring his heart out and loving me for at least 10 years, trying to tell me it would be okay. Despite that, at 16 (4yrs we'd been together, ONLINE relationship with enough love to make you cringe--think ILU's every 20 seconds sometimes) I shattered every concept of humanity or respect ever known to mankind and turned it in his face. Teetering within the eye of the storm, he would stand staring up at the hurricane that I was and try to spread his love and talk logically to me.
  
Excerpts from chat below. there are 100s of lines of me being an ass and him just trying to diffuse the bomb but these two excerpts end in lines that hit fucking home to me today. Please read this and please hate me.

**TLDR:**
  
  I recovered from 20+ yrs of sexual/emotional abuse without ever retaliating. ... Except I completely and totally destroyed the one person who ever loved and cared for me over the course of a year or more. I lost those memories, but looking back, i only got thru 2 chat logs and these were the worst lines that took me from happy in my life to please-kill-me... **i told him to stop being so loving because it was annoying**

Me: god forbid you come up with anything else to say (MAJOR SARCASM)
  
Him: yes, **god forbid i happen to not be the person that only wants to love you**

i posted else where: http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/24k13m/what_is_something_youre_most_afraid_of_losing/ch866is","[Help] I revisited forgotten memories of what I did. Went from happiest person on earth to feeling like I only deserve to live in misery for the rest of time I lost most of my memories pre16 after a decade of mental and sexual abuse. After that I spent another 6 or so years in a different but also abusive situation, and finally found happiness and stability in all aspects of my life. Two days ago I went to look back at the things I did when I was 15, and it's completed destroyed who I am.
  
I don't feel like I deserve to be happy anymore. I regret that I ever was able to be happy. It all makes sense now... For two decades I kept asking, why in the universe are all these horrible things happening to me? Well, it's because I deserve it for what I did (and what I had forgotten I did). Someone please kill me, and feel no guilt...
  
... At 15-16 I broke from all the stuff I went through--I seriously went insane. I stopped caring about everything, let a child sex offender have his way with me for the longest time, and... all of my pent up anger in life.... I let it all out on the one person who had ever treated me with love and respect, a boyfriend of four years. I would let this offender do these things with me (yes sexual) and then go tell the only person that loved me every gruesome detail, rubbing it in his face.
  
But I knew all that. I just didnt realize how horrible it really was.
  
... My boyfriend spent every moment of every day pouring his heart out and loving me for at least 10 years, trying to tell me it would be okay. Despite that, at 16 (4yrs we'd been together, ONLINE relationship with enough love to make you cringe--think ILU's every 20 seconds sometimes) I shattered every concept of humanity or respect ever known to mankind and turned it in his face. Teetering within the eye of the storm, he would stand staring up at the hurricane that I was and try to spread his love and talk logically to me.
  
Excerpts from chat below. there are 100s of lines of me being an ass and him just trying to diffuse the bomb but these two excerpts end in lines that hit fucking home to me today. Please read this and please hate me.

19447,22tgyv,post,I am a pedophile and a virgin,"I'm a 32 year old male from the US. I do not have a criminal record. I'm currently working on my Master's and hold down three part-time jobs. I think about boys as much as I think about work, school, money, etc. I think that a big part of my sexual attraction to boys has to do with their innocence. I feel like I never really had innocence; it was taken from me. When people talk about being in love with their partner or when I hear love songs, I can only relate when I think about my feelings towards certain boys. I grew up around old people and people my age. I honestly think that if I had been around younger kids I would have molested them. Growing up with a sense of loneliness had a benefit I guess.  
I have never had sex with a female before. I'm a good looking guy and certainly don't creep girls out. They just don't interest me. I think as I get older, the harder it will be for me to have friends who are tween boys because it would look creepy. Instead of getting a girlfriend, I spend my time with boys. 
People might worry about someone like me being around their boys but I am not a predatory pedophile. Cuddling with an 8yo boy or having a 9yo take off his swimming trunks in front of you because he feels comfortable with you is enough for me. I don't need to fuck him. In fact, a huge turn on for me is to think about having a 'moment' with a boy (i.e. cuddling, holding) and then for him to reflect warmly on it when he's older. 
My sexual attraction declines when I am around my boy friends. I do jack off to boys though. I like the idea of boys enjoying sex with men or with each other. 
I personally know other boy loving pedophiles too. They seem to 'get' me though I despise pedophiles who are into little girls or both boys and girls. 
I don't see the point in getting 'help.' Mental health professionals will not treat a pedophile unless he's a sex offender.

19449,1xi547,post,A very nasty skeleton in the closest from middle school,"20M. Back in middle school, around the age of 14, I started doing something really fucking weird to get off. This is without a doubt the worst thing I've done in my entire life. I jacked off a lot back then, and I wanted to see and feel the female body in real life very badly. Yet, like most 14 year old guys, I was awkward and couldn't handle any sort of sexual contact (Hadn't even kissed yet). One night, I left my room for snacks when I noticed my sisters attractive friend (a year younger than me) had fallen asleep on the couch outside my room. I remember walking up to her, staring at her, and realizing she was fast asleep I got hard. I started with a simple poke to her leg, then my whole hand while I started jerking with the other one. Unlike voyeurism, it was the contact that really turned me on. I was terrified that she would wake up, but it was also exhilarating. Like it was some fucked up game. The way she was laying down, she had her feet propped up - so I actually used her feet to give myself a footjob. I ran to the bathroom to finish. I'm amazed, and very lucky, she didn't wake up.

I didn't stop with this girl though. I did similar things with my cousin and another one of my sister's friends, a total of three or four times. Mom actually caught me once, unbeknownst to me until a week later. My dad was the one to tell me. That was the turning point, of course. They were just confused and wanted to help fix the problem, which I guess I did because I stopped it. It took more than a few weeks for mom to look at me like I was her sweet little boy again though.

Fast forward to today, I'm a successful college student and a confident, sexually satisfied man. Every now and then though, I think about this. I've learned so much about the way society objectifies women and I call myself a liberal and a feminist. I can identify with and empathize with women, and I would love to be in a compassionate and serious relationship. But my selfish and violating actions still linger over me.

The worst idea I can think of is that one of them may have been awake. Or that this could mean I'm a sex offender.","A very nasty skeleton in the closest from middle school 20M.

19450,1v5n20,post,im a wimp and possibly an asshole,"
I am afraid of being seen as an asshole by women. I'm afraid of offending them, even in subreddits on here. If its /r/gaming, I'm fine. Put me in /r/girlgamers and I lock up. Like 100 alarms ringing in my ear. Yes, I start mind reading. 

I don't know if deep down I am a jerk. I find the trolls around here funny, and just dismiss them as idiots, I wonder why women get so pissed off at them. Troll that gets attention will troll more. 

The counter here is that I never escalate with women in person either. No physical contact except hugs. I am the ""nice guy"" (not the sleep-with-me-bitch guy, but the ""oh he's nice"" because there's no other way to describe me), I'm not nice expecting sex, I'm nice because I hate conflict. Again I don't want to offend. There are times I want to call women out, or say something, but I just say nothing. 

I was very withdrawn growing up, in my room, on the internet. I don't consider myself an asshole really, but I hung around a lot of places with assholes there. Maybe their ideas sort of rubbed off on me as wrong as some may seem. I still don't know if I'm really a jerk or not. 

I don't understand? I'm 23 and have yet to go to college, high school was horrible, my senior year I would skip days to hang out alone. ","im a wimp and possibly an asshole

19452,1u7m8l,post,Am I a bad person?,"Sorry for the wall of text.
When I was about 6-7 (I don't know exactly how old I was, but this is my best guess. All I know for sure is that I was less than 9 and older than 5) I used to go into the bathroom with a female friend and we would look at each other's ""naughty bits"". I felt guilty about this for about a year (I am unsure whether it was the same year or a little later), then I mostly forgot about it, but then the guilt came back, and the cycle repeated until I read a wikipedia article on ""playing doctor"" and realized that I wasn't massively abnormal when I was about 13 (16 now). 
I was fine, for a while, but then I remembered a time, which I think was around the same time but I am unsure because everything is a little hazy from back then, when I got a male friend to put my penis in his mouth and did the same to him. He was younger than me, by maybe 2-3 years, and I can remember him being against the idea, but I talked him into it. I didn't threaten him, or force him physically, but I feel disgusting for pushing him to do this. 
It definitely wasn't sexual, it lasted for about 10 seconds and only happened once, and I think it was a mixture of curiosity and the thrill of breaking the rules that motivated me (I was stupidly well behaved as a child) but I still feel like I used him and that I am a horrible person for doing so.
I remembered this not long ago, and since, the guilty feeling has been coming and going every few months and making me feel subhuman. Sometimes it seems like no big deal but other times I absolutely hate myself for it. 
Also, I can remember shutting one of my friend's little sisters in a room for what was probably about 30 seconds (he took part in it but it was my idea) and she cried, (EDIT: I just remembered that I was locked in my room as a punishment as a toddler. I have now idea for how long or what for but I have a very clear memory of crying and hammering on the door and begging to be let out), and also running past a kid of maybe 1-2 and brushing against them intentionally and making them cry. First when I was 6 and second when I was 4. I have no idea where my hatred of children even a tiny bit younger than me came from, but it has basically disappeared, although I am worried that if I ever have children (although I very much doubt I will ever have sex with someone) I will end up hating them or abusing them.
I also had a great friend when I was about 12-14 who I constantly had stupid arguments with; I can remember one in particular being about whether or not fried squid would be nice or not. It seems tiny, but we both used to get really pissed off and not back down at all. She was naive, but intelligent in her own way, but I can remember generally insinuating that she was stupid. I think she just accepted that I could be a total asshole sometimes, and never took me seriously, but once when I called her ""slow"", a friend of one of my other friends agreed with me and I was too much of a pussy to admit I was wrong. I also had a massive argument with her over something I can't even remember, and ended up throwing a massive chunk of snow at her, and I know my father has anger management issues so I probably do to.
Finally, I have said a lot of shit to the person who is basically my only friend at the moment, who I have known since I was 3 years old, that could be seen as insulting without even realizing, even in the past couple years. For example, implying that he was less intelligent than me, which I genuinely believed at the time and I just assumed that he wouldn't be offended by what I saw as the truth. I have since realized that he is just as capable as me, and again, I haven't got the balls to apologize. God knows why he has stuck with me for so long, but I am incredibly glad he did.
I also have a shit ton of other problems, like my depression, aspergers, the fact I have been to school for probably less than a week overall in the past year, and some major family issues, but I just felt that I needed to say this. 
TL;DR: On bad days I think I am a perverted asshole but on good days I think I am past all that.","Am I a bad person? Sorry for the wall of text.

First when I was 6 and second when I was 4. I have no idea where my hatred of children even a tiny bit younger than me came from, but it has basically disappeared, although I am worried that if I ever have children (although I very much doubt I will ever have sex with someone) I will end up hating them or abusing them.
I also had a great friend when I was about 12-14 who I constantly had stupid arguments with; I can remember one in particular being about whether or not fried squid would be nice or not. It seems tiny, but we both used to get really pissed off and not back down at all. She was naive, but intelligent in her own way, but I can remember generally insinuating that she was stupid. I think she just accepted that I could be a total asshole sometimes, and never took me seriously, but once when I called her ""slow"", a friend of one of my other friends agreed with me and I was too much of a pussy to admit I was wrong. I also had a massive argument with her over something I can't even remember, and ended up throwing a massive chunk of snow at her, and I know my father has anger management issues so I probably do to.
Finally, I have said a lot of shit to the person who is basically my only friend at the moment, who I have known since I was 3 years old, that could be seen as insulting without even realizing, even in the past couple years. For example, implying that he was less intelligent than me, which I genuinely believed at the time and I just assumed that he wouldn't be offended by what I saw as the truth. I have since realized that he is just as capable as me, and again, I haven't got the balls to apologize. God knows why he has stuck with me for so long, but I am incredibly glad he did.
I also have a shit ton of other problems, like my depression, aspergers, the fact I have been to school for probably less than a week overall in the past year, and some major family issues, but I just felt that I needed to say this. 
TL;DR: On bad days I think I am a perverted asshole but on good days I think I am past all that.",0,2.0,2014-01-02 5:47,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1u7m8l/am_i_a_bad_person/,Offender
19453,1ppgz2,post,I (MM/42) have been banging my boss (MW/38) for months at work,"I transferred to this office (national retail corp.) a little more than 2 years ago.  We got along very well from the start, had a little flirtatious talk, eye contact, etc. but nothing serious. Started going for coffee every couple days or so and it became a habit. Then started talking more about personal lives and eventually were relating all kinds of personal stuff – marriages, kids, frustrations.

She emails me one day about six months ago, asks me to come to her office near the end of the day.  I go in and she says, “can you close the door, please.”  I’m thinking uh-oh, what did I do.

Then she starts in about she’s been thinking about something for weeks, asks me not to be offended, but she’s been thinking more and more about me and is very attracted to me and is there any chance I feel the same way? She’s extremely embarrassed and nervous and I am somewhat shocked, but I walk closer – I was thinking I would maybe pat her on the shoulder or hand and tell her to calm down, it’s no big deal – and before I know it we’re in each other’s arms kissing, then ripping each other’s clothes off. Did it on the couch in her office right then and there.

We have now been doing this once or twice a week, always in her office (I don’t have one) – except for once in a server room – and either early in the morning or late in the day.  One or the other of us will email a code phrase asking if it’s doable. 

We are constantly saying we should stop, that each time will be the last. Both of us feel awful about it. But we also apparently are addicted. And I must also confess that the sex is amazing. A lot of it has to do with  the illicit nature of it and the location I’m sure. 

I know it has to end and I know it’s very wrong but I can’t seem to help myself. She is very attractive and very uninhibited, not to mention a good boss in other (strictly business) ways. I feel lost.

19454,1mz845,post,I (28M) hate dating as a guy.,"I was blessed with being born a good-looking guy, albeit short in stature and far from perfect. But girls have always liked me, and I've always liked them, despite being on the shy and insecure side. I'm a perfectionist and feel things need to be perfect and flawless in the way I present myself, or else I'm simply not worth anyone's time. It's not always fair to myself, but it's the way I am and I'm not looking for anyone to try and change it. What I don't like is that other guys (and even many women) will try and tell you that you need to perceive relationships a specific way in order to achieve success with them. As though it's a game we are either winning or losing at.

You know who don't see relationships this way? Women. They are given advice and pointers on how to act and dress and look, but they aren't told to limit their expectations. If anything (and yes, I'm generalizing), they are told to focus on their external attractiveness in order to cast as wide of a net as possible until a Prince Charming comes in with all of the traits they're looking for in a man. To contrast, *men* are told that ""this is how women are"" and we need to adjust around their expectations accordingly. For us, it can feel like a constant audition because we can easily be replaced. When did it become this way? Why is the act of courting so heavily one-sided, even in a post-3rd generation feminism world? Stereotypically, I fall under many of the categories women bring up when they feel reluctant to date... Fears of feeling inadequate, fear of not being good-looking enough, fear of sleeping with someone and never hearing from them again, and fear of being used.

Getting back to me... Growing up, dating was easy. No pressures to ""go all the way"" right away, or pretend I had money and success that I didn't have. I was defined by my personality or my hairstyle/clothing as opposed to what occupation I currently had. There was no need to pretend like I was an extremely important person with an amazing outside life, when girls knew I sat three chairs behind them in geometry class throwing spitballs with friends and watching youtube song parodies in class. I was never the guy portrayed on TV who is just looking to reach a base or ""get it in"". I loved being romantic and buying my girlfriends flowers, giving them unexpected surprises, holding hands, and slow, passionate kisses. 

But as I got to college, and it became expected that dating = sex and boys = men, things started getting much more complicated for me. I reluctantly lost my virginity when I was 19 and in college, to one of the most beautiful women on campus. It was terrible, I kept going soft, the condom kept slipping off when I entered her, and we finally had to get her to be on top just for it to work. Then, once it did, I lasted all of 60 seconds while trying to think about anything but not finishing (since I knew it was common for guys to finish fast and had of course seen hundreds of jokes about pathetic guys being ""minute men."") I'm endowed well, but had severe performance anxiety because I simply had no idea what I was doing that night, combined with not feeling ready or trusting this woman enough. 

Luckily, she was completely cool about it, and we tried later that night with much better results. The two of us ended up dating for nine months, we fell in love with each other, she was extremely sexy and warm and great to have around. One thing I did learn was that not always being up for sex as a man, comes off as incredibly hurtful to a woman. I absolutely HATED this. I have a pretty average male sex drive, but not being up for it when a girl is when it's just casual dating, is an absolute relationship killer because it's interpreted as you not being attracted to them 9 out of 10 times. Despite this, her and I had a seemingly great, yet slightly turbulent relationship during college. But then the unexpected happened... She slept with one of my friends on campus. I was devastated. She was apologetic, but we couldn't recover, I ended the relationship, and to make matters worse, she fled to the guy she had cheated on me with. Seeing them on campus together felt like daggers in me, especially considering this was the only person I had slept with or fallen in love with.

This was nine years ago. Yes, it created trust issues in my mind, but if anything, I felt it gave me some perspective of the reality of very serious relationships from a very young age... It jaded me for a year or two, but it didn't distort reality for me in any way. I learned that the only way to recover from hardships like this is to simply move on with a positive outlook (fake or not) and don't look back. And that's exactly what I did. Since that time, I've dated several other amazing and beautiful women. Some have been great, others have been quite rough around the edges, but I've learned a lot about myself through all of them. Mainly, that I'm much different from most guys. I've learned that, despite it being 2013, there are still quite a few gender roles and expectations of guys in the dating world. The two big ones, at least from my perspective, are confidence and initiative. For men, these two traits are mandatory. For women, they are optional.

I see stories all the time about men feeling like they ""have to pay"" for everything, hold doors open, and basically act like a chivalrous man from 1958. I don't see this to be true, or women with these expectations at all. The women I've dated have always either offered to split, ask ""if I'm sure"" five times if I offer to pick up the bill, or even insist on paying occasionally. Women, from my experience, just want their guy to treat them well and are well aware that it's 2013 and guys shouldn't pay for everything. Yes, there's still an imbalance, but it's not like it used to be and women who believe in equality aren't nearly as hard to find as many men on here make it out to be.

But here is the more blaring problem with being a man in the dating world: We are expected to be confident, funny, competent, spontaneous, happy, and charming, and the initiators. One can argue that most of these same expectations are there for women, but these characteristics are MUCH more mandatory with men in my experience. And it's not always easy. In fact, unless you are all of these things all the time, it's never easy.

Without going into how handsome or witty or tall a man is (as are some of the main positives in dating as a guy), what if a man is extremely insecure and doesn't like taking initiative? I do like who I am, but I'm not always confident and absolutely HATE taking all the initiative (or even 75%). In an ideal world, I would ask out as many women who asked me out in my lifetime. I wouldn't ever have a situation where a girl waits six months or three years for me to ask her out, because I never knew she had requited feelings for me. I wouldn't need to decide that the girl and I should be exclusive, or that we're officially dating now. I don't want to be the key-holder of when we hang out, and I don't like that if the hangouts aren't frequent enough, the woman will assume I'm not interested and go sleep with another man.

Being handsome helps, and I am grateful for being blessed with decent looks. But the majority of our appeal as men comes from our personalities and our abilities to be confident and ""take charge."" This has never been me. I am simply tired of being the person in charge of dictating everything. I'm well aware that there are women out there who can take plenty of initiative, but they are few and far between because the culture we live in still teaches most of them to be the passive ones or else they are told they'll be used or taken for granted. It's not so much that the men are taught to be the aggressors, but it is simply expected that we like sex, so we should do the pursuing. The problem is that I don't much care for sex with a girl when it was primarily attained from me being ""on my game"" that night, making them laugh at the right times, or pursuing them at the exact pace they were expecting. I want it to be because they like me... Not because I'm being rewarded.

I don't like that 4 out of 5 text conversations need to be started by me, or that I need to ask for every phone number because traditionally I'm the pursuer and they're the ones who are there to be courted. I would LOVE to be courted. That would honestly be one of the most flattering experiences of my life, regardless of whether I was even interested in the person. And the compliments. Who wouldn't love the amount of praise some women get simply for looking pretty, being sweet, or dressing nice? When did it become so blasphemous for a woman to tell a man they're special without using sex as their way of showing it. Sex is great, but I'd love to be told I'm a catch in a way other than a girl spreading her legs for me, or guiding my hand up her shirt, or her's down my jeans.

I enjoy *mutual* sex, and hate feeling like I'm being pushed into a coliseum where I'm competing for someone's affections based on how boldly I can flail my metaphoric ""confidence"" whip around without crossing the line and offending anyone. I feel like having trust issues as a woman is manageable, but having them as a man can be devastating to one's appeal. I do believe men can have emotions, and the suggestion that we have to be stoic, is highly overrated. But we do seem to have a pressure to seem confident at all times, even if we're not. And this is an infinitely more difficult thing to fake than any amount of mascara or push-up bra can do.

This rant wasn't motivated by any sort of recent relationship failure or bad breakup. This is something I have been holding in for a long time, and the best outlet I could think of for now, was via some anonymous venting. Thank you all who made it to the end of this.

**TL;DR: I have an extremely difficult time forcing myself to be ""the guy"" in relationships, and hate the societal expectations people have of me as a male and how I should view relationships. I'm not unsuccessful by any means and am not bitter from the fresh taste of rejection as I know many men are understandably frustrated about, but I have come to hate the fact that I need to do 95% of the pursuing and initiating.

19455,1msvhi,post,I'm (probably) A Rapist,"This entry is cross-posted on my blog at ( http://llltexas.com ) the article is here ( http://llltexas.wpengine.com/2013/09/im-probably-a-rapist/ ) if you want to reach me, posting a comment on my blog is the best way. I am unlikely to check or reply to this thread with any regularity.

This isn’t a Reddit confession of something horrible I did on a dark night when I was a stupid teenager. In fact, I’m not even sure I’m a rapist, but I can with some certainty say I probably had non consensual sex with a girl at some point in my teenage-early adulthood years based on simple math.

I’ve never held anyone down and stuck (anything) in, I’ve never slept with someone so intoxicated that they couldn’t comprehend what they were doing, and I have never (knowingly) slept with a girl under the age of 18, though I knew a couple who went to nightclubs. In fact, I’ve mostly been a total gentleman my whole life, and have never been accused of anything sexually improper by anyone. On my right hand I can count the number of times I’ve been with a girl who wasn’t from a location that checks ID, and on my left I can count the number of times I was with anyone who was intoxicated to even a small degree on anything at all.

None of that matters, you see, because I didn’t hire a private investigator to track down witnesses and certificates to the birth of every girl I was with before I was with them.

Given the prevalence of underage girls in nightclubs (~4% under 18) and the number of women I’ve done ‘enough’ with (~40, those memories get mushy after a while) I calculate that I have a 19.5% chance of never having slept with an underage girl, or about a 80% chance of having had sex with someone under 18. I am probably an unconvicted statutory rapist. That number is slightly off because the age of consent in Texas is 17, not 18, and Texas does have (weak) Romeo and Juliet laws, which would improve my odds a bit, but I couldn’t find numbers for the number of 17 year olds in nightclubs, and it wouldn’t change the number drastically, so the point still stands that I am (probably) a rapist.

As any vaginas-first feminist will tell you, and as the government enforcers interpret the laws to mean, rape is rape is rape. Even a single case of “didn’t know” foreplay can get you put on the same list with people who chain 8 year olds down and sodomize them until they can no longer bear children. That’s patently absurd, of course, but it is nevertheless how the laws are interpreted, and it’s the interpretation that matters, not the letter. The law means what the people who have the power to lock you in a cage or seize your house say it means, not what the words on a piece of paper, common sense, or even a sense of justice say it means.

I, by all rights, (probably) deserve to be listed as a sex offender. I won’t be, because the vast majority of the sleeping around I did was well over a decade ago, and I pretty much (have always) stuck to around my age group (so far as I know), which as one gets older protects one slightly from these underage predator girls. A decade from the girl turning 18 is the statute of limitations in Texas for sexual assault of a minor (there is no actual statutory rape charge in Texas), so I’m safe enough from being convicted to talk about this.

It’s (probably) just as well that I am mostly a beta male and have a tendency to let women leave me on their own terms, that (probably) saved me from a lot of grief.

I am speaking out on this because there are an awful lot of young men in Texas who get convicted for things they had no way of knowing or preventing. We need a wholesale reform of these rape laws to take consent and knowledge into account for listing on the sexual predator lists, of which only about 5% are actually dangerous. We need to introduce mens rea back to our legal system, especially when it’s not practical to verify information, to protect people from accidents and naivete.

We don’t even vaguely resemble a fair and just society anymore, more like a strict police state that punishes as many people are possible as harshly as possible for political purposes. People say I am paranoid, but 25% of the country has a criminal record and I don’t, so I say they weren’t paranoid enough.","I'm (probably) A Rapist This entry is cross-posted on my blog at ( http://llltexas.com ) the article is here ( http://llltexas.wpengine.com/2013/09/im-probably-a-rapist/ ) if you want to reach me, posting a comment on my blog is the best way.

On my right hand I can count the number of times I’ve been with a girl who wasn’t from a location that checks ID, and on my left I can count the number of times I was with anyone who was intoxicated to even a small degree on anything at all.

None of that matters, you see, because I didn’t hire a private investigator to track down witnesses and certificates to the birth of every girl I was with before I was with them.

Given the prevalence of underage girls in nightclubs (~4% under 18) and the number of women I’ve done ‘enough’ with (~40, those memories get mushy after a while) I calculate that I have a 19.5% chance of never having slept with an underage girl, or about a 80% chance of having had sex with someone under 18. I am probably an unconvicted statutory rapist. That number is slightly off because the age of consent in Texas is 17, not 18, and Texas does have (weak) Romeo and Juliet laws, which would improve my odds a bit, but I couldn’t find numbers for the number of 17 year olds in nightclubs, and it wouldn’t change the number drastically, so the point still stands that I am (probably) a rapist.

As any vaginas-first feminist will tell you, and as the government enforcers interpret the laws to mean, rape is rape is rape. Even a single case of “didn’t know” foreplay can get you put on the same list with people who chain 8 year olds down and sodomize them until they can no longer bear children. That’s patently absurd, of course, but it is nevertheless how the laws are interpreted, and it’s the interpretation that matters, not the letter. The law means what the people who have the power to lock you in a cage or seize your house say it means, not what the words on a piece of paper, common sense, or even a sense of justice say it means.

I, by all rights, (probably) deserve to be listed as a sex offender. I won’t be, because the vast majority of the sleeping around I did was well over a decade ago, and I pretty much (have always) stuck to around my age group (so far as I know), which as one gets older protects one slightly from these underage predator girls. A decade from the girl turning 18 is the statute of limitations in Texas for sexual assault of a minor (there is no actual statutory rape charge in Texas), so I’m safe enough from being convicted to talk about this.

It’s (probably) just as well that I am mostly a beta male and have a tendency to let women leave me on their own terms, that (probably) saved me from a lot of grief.

I am speaking out on this because there are an awful lot of young men in Texas who get convicted for things they had no way of knowing or preventing. We need a wholesale reform of these rape laws to take consent and knowledge into account for listing on the sexual predator lists, of which only about 5% are actually dangerous. We need to introduce mens rea back to our legal system, especially when it’s not practical to verify information, to protect people from accidents and naivete.

We don’t even vaguely resemble a fair and just society anymore, more like a strict police state that punishes as many people are possible as harshly as possible for political purposes. People say I am paranoid, but 25% of the country has a criminal record and I don’t, so I say they weren’t paranoid enough.",0,2.0,2013-09-20 21:14,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1msvhi/im_probably_a_rapist/,Offender
19456,1lwkxu,post,My stance on gay people.,"I want to apologize in advance because I am going to offend a lot of people. I really don't want to offend anyone. I just want to let things off my chest, I hope you guys don't think I'm a demon, I pride myself on being a very very good person and a positive influence to society.

I dont really know where to begin. The point of this post is about gay marriage in America.  I am against it because I was born and raised a Catholic Christian.  I understand it is brought forth and even executed in multiple states now.  It goes against what I was brought to believe.

I was brought up to believe it is a radical choice people make.  I honestly have no idea what my parents feel on gays or gay marriage, it wasn't them, it was the Catholic religion and the schools I went to, and my interpretation of the Catholic teachings.

I hardly even identify myself with Catholocism anymore.  I think I would be described as an Agnostic at this point, but I don't even know.  I like to believe my God exists.  If he didn't exist, it wouldn't surprise me.  That being said, it was drilled into me and I have beliefs.

I don't feel gay marriage should exist because my religion taught me marriage is between man and woman.

I have had gay friends in my life, of the same gender.  It makes me slightly uncomfortable knowing that, but they are my friends.  I don't think they ever felt things for me, but I accept who they are and what they want to do when it comes to embarking in a relationship.  If they want to engage in sexual acts with the same gender, that is their choice.  (i ended up saying it again, choice.)

I understand the idea behind this is that gay couples should have the same rights and benefits as hetero couples.  I can't wrap my head around it.

While I may be a Catholic that actually has detached from religion a lot, and wouldn't even be remotely surprised if any and all religions are a fallacy, I still hold my beliefs.  My beliefs are in intelligent design.  So, in short:

TL;DR - Penises were designed to be inserted into vaginas to create life, and as far away I have strayed from the core of my Catholic upbringing, I can't shake the notion that our country is swaying towards gay people being brought together in holy matrimony.

I'm really sorry to the homosexuals that are going to read this and disagree so furiously.  I just can't wrap my head around it.

Unrelated here, for the record I am a virgin that will gladly have sex before marriage, and that is a no-no in my doctrine.  I am weak for that, and contradict my own statement of what the purpose of our sexual organs are, but such is the human life of sin.","My stance on gay people.

19457,1j0y7o,post,Me and the 3 loves of my life. The 'B' part (AMA),"My second text, I tried to make it as least confusing as possible. Based on feedback from the first. It is a long text and English is not my native language so have patience.
-----------------------------------

On my second year of college I met **B**, in fact, we met through the university website chat. I was out of anatomy class and thought about going home but for reasons I never understood, I decided to go to the computer lab and spend a little time there.

In the chat were mostly concentrated single students looking for friendship and someone to date. I was chatting for no reason and a nerd-related subject came up and I made a joke. She laughed, high in the room. Next. she starts looking for the guy who made the joke, and I was after the loud laughing girl. And from then on we started to have a closer contact.

**B** was already dating a guy when we met, their relationship was open (more advantage to him than to her) and so she wanted nothing special with me. We became friendship with few benefits, teasing on both sides, some spicy comments, a little kiss now and ever but nothing more. A year goes by and we are much closer. We had nothing to do with our afternoon and she used to spent time in my house. Used to watch anime or movies together, played Magic the Gathering, video games. On weekends, she was with her boyfriend playing RPG's and I was with my friends.

**B** is a chubby girl with full breasts and very fun to be with. Unlike me, a more serious and reserved person, **B** is more spontaneous, outgoing and sociable. Enjoys to see porn as much as any guy does, open minded, nerdy and a bit hippie. She had urolagnia as a fetish just like me. Impossible not to like a girl like that. After her boyfriend had sex with some **B**'s disaffection, they broke up giving opportunity for me. She just wanted that our relationship was not like hers and that I should try hard to be more open about myself.

And this is a very big problem. I usually do not reveal what I feel or think about. I tend to keep it, in me and for me. I grew up pretty much alone while my mother worked downtown as a civil servant. Used to went back and forth from school alone, in my childhood and pre-adolescence, spent the afternoon playing in the street and and if I got in a fight (despite living in a country with high miscegenation, suffered a lot of prejudice because of skin color) had no adult relative around to defend myself or talk about. I believe that these factors have led me to be so full of secrets and keep things reserved. So, being unable to be on a cooperative relationship with **B** the way she would like, we started having small discussions.

Meanwhile, close to finish college, I began doing a traineeship at the school where I would meet **S**. If we were upset with each other, me spending much of my time at school was not helping. But I did not care much, always wanted to become a teacher and had not taken so long just to realize this dream. She understood that it was my ultimate goal and proceeded to give less importance about me being in school all the time.

At the beginning of the following year, I was effected by the school, but I had to change my schedule. I accepted without thinking twice. Not many months later, I met **S** (but you guys already know that). Different from what I was used to, the girls could, somehow, get our phone numbers and call us on the weekend, or send sms with loving messages. There was no the name of who had sent, only the number, this left **B** really angry and I always trying to explain the unexplainable. *(dont get me wrong, I am not nor ever was a handsome guy. I spent my entire high school looking girls from afar. I was too nerdy for them. But this attention that the students deposited on me -and my colleagues, also around 25 years old- was new and, to some, extent very good.)*

The time passed, I was already involved with **S**. **B** noticed the signs of betrayal. Impatience, unexplained rides and spendings, until one day she got tired and had the courage that I never had. Ended our relationship. We spent hours talking and crying and I ended up telling her everything I had avoided and hidden. I know that she was more offended, but it was very painful to me. Still is, remembering.

I lost total contact with **B** during the months I dated **S**. Then, already unhappy with the whole situation that was having with **S**, I started to seek out for **B** wherever she might be. **B** was more than my ex-girlfriend, was a close friend, it was with her that I used to say stuff that no one else knew, I was able to talk with her in a way that **S** was not mature enough to provide and I had and needed to vent, drinking was not helping anything. All this coupled with sadness, regret and longing made me go after **B**.

She was dating another guy. A jealous and possessive ""bully"". Made of **B**'s life a living hell. Forced her to go to his house after work even if she hadnt another change of clothes, came to hit her a few times, and months later she confided to me, she thought sometimes that's what she deserved. Reconnect our friendship was not easy, but it happened. Months after this reapproximation she had the strength to end the relationship with this damn wife beater and we continue just as good friends. Time passes and we dating back together, for our joy and for our friends and family.

I changed job, went to a new school. The dating was going well, the girls attention with *the new teacher* wasnt affecting me as much as it affected me in the past and if any sign of interest from some student emerged, I would cut right from the start. Little more than a few months, having already known **L**, **B** warns me that **L**  has some kind of interest in me and I am corresponding with little but doing it anyway. I tell her that's bullshit, and that is not the same as happened with **S** that she was imagining things and should stop being so obsessive. 

Until I give up the teaching career. Factors related to the support that the State should supply and low earnings, made me look for another job. Before we lose contact, **L** asks me an email so she can talk to me. I give her my phone and email. **B** thinks I did wrong, but nothing more.

Finally, **B** and I started living together. We had plans to marry and agree it would be nice if we knew what it was like to live together after 10 years of dating. I was in a job very close to home, her -despite working far- had a good salary. In the middle of last year the routine and commitments with the house, bills and others stuff was undermining our relationship. I was growing tired of that and so was she.

**L** and I were exchanging emails or sms constantly, she used to talk about her life, I talked about mine and so on. **B** was bitching too much about this approach between me and **L** so I replied messages when **B** was not around. Until the point that the inevitable happened. It was evident that both were interested in each other.

Last October, was **L**'s birthday party. Lied to **B** saying I would visit my mother and would sleep there. I bought a gift for **L**, congratulated her for the day and the rest to be said is that it was a horrible night. Come home, **B** asks me how was spending the weekend with my mother, I answer vaguely and the next day I went to work. After some time working **B** enters furious, asks us to talk in private. I'm scared. She begins to ask with tears in her eyes since when it is happening and I dont know what she's talking about. She informs me that **L** sent a long email explaining and apologizing for the birthday night. **B** says she hates me, I ended up with her confidence and it asks me to leave home. I dont argue or deny the allegations. I say that at the end of the day, I'll get some clothes and leave.

From October until the present day a lot happened, I returned to live with my mother, **L** and I ended the contact *(details that I'll provide in another text)*, **S** -[as told before](http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1iw7w2/me_and_the_3_loves_of_my_life_the_s_part/)-, once again contact me and **B** and I still talk and we nourish affection for each other.","Me and the 3 loves of my life.

I justify it to my self this way I was broke and in a country where I had no work visa and didnt speak the language and no way home (Home was the other side of the world) and it was -30 degrees out side.

It wasn't till I realized the scale of what I was doing and the impact I was having on guys lives, lonely guys that just wanted a date, that I decided to quit and do more legitimate things to make money online.

With out going into detail too much as I dont want anyone to replicate what i was doing. I taught myself to code and made bots/programs, would create hundreds of fake dating profiles on various websites and convince guys I wanted to meet up and date them, all they had to do was join this other  ""free"" dating site to prove they were over 18 and not a sex offender. (they had to sign up with their CC's). Classic bate and switch. As soon as they joined, they would never here from me again.

Their Credit Cards would get charged hundreds and hundres of dollars, every month, only way to get out of it was to cancel the card.

I was making between $200 - $1000 Every day. And was only taking me 10 minutes a day, as my programs did all the work unattended.

As i mentioned above it wasnt untill I started reading the messages, that I realized how much i was fucking lonely guys over. There must be a hell of alot of guys of there that wanna kick my ass.

If I did this to you and of you (there were hundreds every day) im sorry, I was desperate for money. I no longer do this, it still works and could start up again right now, but I cant/wont.

I taught myself to code and made bots/programs, would create hundreds of fake dating profiles on various websites and convince guys I wanted to meet up and date them, all they had to do was join this other  ""free"" dating site to prove they were over 18 and not a sex offender. (they had to sign up with their CC's). Classic bate and switch. As soon as they joined, they would never here from me again.

Their Credit Cards would get charged hundreds and hundres of dollars, every month, only way to get out of it was to cancel the card.

I was making between $200 - $1000 Every day. And was only taking me 10 minutes a day, as my programs did all the work unattended.

As i mentioned above it wasnt untill I started reading the messages, that I realized how much i was fucking lonely guys over. There must be a hell of alot of guys of there that wanna kick my ass.

If I did this to you and of you (there were hundreds every day) im sorry, I was desperate for money. I no longer do this, it still works and could start up again right now, but I cant/wont. It still eats at me, I now do more legitimate things online to make money.",15,6.0,2013-07-18 11:49,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1ijxeh/i_used_to_run_internet_dating_scams_and_i_feel/,Offender
19460,1gyg5z,post,When I was younger I had raped my little brother.,"Male here. When I was younger (11-12 years old) I raped my brother, who at the time was about 9 years old. We used to kiss each other, but we never went as far as having sex with each other. I remember that night quite clearly and I honestly wish it could be removed from my memory. I remember asking him several times that particular day if he wanted to have sex and he repeatedly told me he did not want to. I remember him falling asleep that night and me pulling his underwear down and proceeding to anally rape him. I remember all of it. Everything.

At the time I didn't realize what I was doing. I didn't know about rape. I seriously had no idea that what I was doing was wrong. I was an idiot. How I wish I wasn't so stupid enough to rape my own brother. I can't even talk to him anymore since that day. We NEVER talk though (this is mostly because he lives in another state and haven't ever really been that close to keep in touch). But still, what I've done haunts me to this day. I am about 99% sure he didn't know what was going on either because he didn't wake up at all during, nor did he act differently or bring it up that following morning. 

Anyway, I just wanted to let this out. I've never told anyone this. It hurts to know that I've done this, it really does. I'm ashamed and I hate myself for it. I don't know if I will ever be able to have a relationship with my brother because of this. I just feel like a terrible person and I should have known at the time that what I was doing was wrong, but yet I couldn't keep my sexual urges in control. :'(




Thanks for listening, I really appreciate it.





Edit: Hey guys thanks for your advice, I've decided that I am going to talk with my therapist about this. This is really something that has bothered me so much for many years and I've also attempted suicide in the past because of it. As of now I will be seeking professional help in hopes that I'll be able to accept what I did, and then hopefully talk with my brother about this. If I've offended any of you then I'm incredibly sorry because I really didnt mean to and I hope you can accept my apology. ","When I was younger I had raped my little brother. Male here.

19461,1fu5p5,post,I got a reformed sex offender kicked out of my university on accident.,"I'm a forensic science major, and last year (my junior year), I had a class with an annoying old man. 

You know the type, argues with the teacher, has really strong religious attitudes (a bit out of place in a science class), brings up his religious beliefs all the time. Not the worst person ever, just a really fucking annoying dude. 

I facebook stalk him a little, figuring he's probably got some stupid young-earth-creationist bullshit there to laugh at. 

Google searching his name brings up a sex offender registry entry. No way. I found one from out of state with a photo, it's the same guy. Arrested in the 80s and 90s for sodomy, molestation, all stuff with a minor.

At this point I'm not even thinking about how irritating he is in class, I'm just feeling like fucking Sherlock Holmes, like I just caught a criminal. Out of state registry even says he's delinquent, hasn't checked in. I'm feeling like Batman. 

I set up an anonymous email address, use TOR, connect through public wifi, all that. I send out an email to everyone in my class (CC at the beginning of the term leaked everyone's emails to each other) including the professor. Includes link, description of his crimes from court records I googled up. 

Send it off, feeling like a motherfucking crime fighter. Just to do my civic duty, I decide to send one out to the sex offenders division of my local police department, in case they just want to check up on the guy or whatever. 

Class is on Monday, I'm excited to see if he'll be there, or if he'll get arrested, dragged away in chains like the scumbag he is. Monday rolls around, he's not in class. I'm feeling pretty smug, like a goddamn superhero.

I get an email like an hour later from the police department, sent to my throwaway email.

Really nice lady explains that Mr. SexOffender has been keeping up with his parole, the online databases are just out of date, he's voluntarily on chemical castration and attends bi-weekly therapy and group therapy. She says that she's sorry I feel unsafe around him, but that he's one of the best behaved offenders she's met, he self polices really well, attends church all the time and tries to help other offenders keep themselves in check. 

She even told me he's going back to school.

Friend in registration tells me he's no longer registered. New, in state updated offender registry lists him as delinquent again. 

Sure he molested kids or whatever, and I know the recidivism rate is impossibly high and that most offenders never recover, but it's been a year now and every time I think about it I feel guilty.

Edit 1: Edited for clarity.

Edit 2: To address what his actual crimes were, I don't want to go into too many details but two specific counts listed (not all of the counts listed, just two examples) on his sex offender pages (two states) were: lewd and lascivious acts with a minor under 14, and forced penetration with a foreign object of a minor under 16. So it wasn't a case of public urination, or anything of that sort. At the time he committed his crimes, he was actually sexually violent. But, as one commenter mentioned, the last charge was over 20 years ago.

19462,1ejdsk,post,Took an Ex back after she fucked another dude and terminated our pregnancy 4 hours later. (xpost from ask reddit),"TL/DR Ex cheated the night before she terminated her pregnancy, and I took her back.

Well, not quite when they found out I was not the cheater, in fact I never considered it. She on the other hand was a repeat offender and I, well a bit of a naive fool for not noping the fuck out on the first time.

I had a girlfriend for about four years, we met shortly after I left school and within three months we were in love, fucking hard, passionate, wild, uninhibited, free. It was wonderful, she was smart, engaging, funny, liked good music and as the summer ground on we found that both of us had huge flaws but we loved one another so we we're able to work through and start to grow together. It was good, it was new, we we're * committed* and adult. So we did the whole shtick, I went into business started working hard, she went through a couple low end jobs with my support and finally she bought a car and was able to start to go back into her professional life. It was tough sure, but we made it work. After about a year though she started getting antsy, restless.

It was summer now, about a year after we had gotten together she was restless, you could feel it, sometimes hot, sometimes cold. Our relationship began to suffer, she started hitting the bars at night, driving home 12-15 miles at 3 am, red-eyed, sometimes horny, other times looking for a fight, usually drunk. It was tough, she was up, then down, amazing weekend one weekend, hot late drunk night the next. We fucked a lot, stress relief I supposed, but at one point it took, well you know it happened, wrong time, no protection, bam she's pregnant. I'm scared, a little weirded, my kid is in there... I'm excited, I'm going to be a Dad.

Trouble is she's still pounding the bottle, we talk long and extensively about where we can go together, how we can make things work, numbers, jobs, living situations, and a ton of ""look, I love you I'm here for you"", naturally we talked about the alternative, termination. My position was well, it is not my body it's not my decision, I'll support her decision if a termination is what she wants, but I want to keep the kid. Overall, we decide together, we're giving it a shot. Well after about three weeks we've gone through the preliminaries, she gets an ultra-sound. Sees the little smudge of DNA life inside of her. She's petrified, in days she transforms from cautiously optimistic to paranoid, volatile, back to the bars, back to her friends.

The friends. Her crowd was always different from mine, a little rougher, a bit sharper on the edges, lots of kids that didn't quite fit when younger. It was a pretty mixed bag, a couple were in and out of psychiatric wards, some were daddy's girls, others (well the smart ones) moved off for a few years, some didn't come back. She (the ex) had a pretty on off relationship with a friend, they we're the kind that crossed paths every couple months, the kind that sounded bottom and ran together a bit. When they were out on the town, they were a force of nature, wild . Her people, when she got out there she'd run, she'd boogie, she was a sexual animal, sensual, and easy to notice. Her friends well good, bad, not much of a network though.

Her friend lived with a roommate, a washed up kind of once upon a time emo kid with three children and a pissed off ex wife, the salty kind. I never knew him well, I didn't like him though, he was distant, didn't give the vibe of feeling much of the presence, an underlying touch of hostility, the kind of simian animal urge gave those flags that this dude, watch him, he's eyeing your girlfriend was there almost foretelling the end.

Well, the collision was not inevitable, but all the pieces were there. The ex was terrified of the notion of losing her freedom, her ability to set the world on her own terms, to come and go as she pleased, I think underneath everything she feared commitment, she feared that a kid would be one of those transformative catalysts that would break her from her former self, box her constrain her. She rebelled and howled against an unfair world, against the social pretension of a relationship saved? contrived? by a pregnancy and proposal. She started hanging out with her friend, and she set a date. She'd terminate, at first I was indifferent coldly the reality set in that what life, what potential we had inadvertently created was about to slip away. A sort of fatalistic pall touched the relationship, coldness ran through the spirit, she was peeling away, spinning ever so slowly and there was nothing I could do. Conversations devolved into pop-psychology, voices rose, the storm had arrived. She'd leave declaring never to return but she'd be there in the morning.


Finally one night, ""I'm staying out"". 
One night

.two nights

.three nights

She was at her parents’ house, I knew this, I missed her the house was on the way into my work, her car was there every morning. she kept in touch, texting every day, we spoke, things were distant, difficult, but the love was there in the background whispering to both of us ""just keep at it"" I receive a call, we talk, she's coming home, for a week she is around the house we start opening back up, talking about well can we make this? We're growing, we're moving forward, she's coming back down. The termination date is looming, four days before it and I've been thinking, finally I ask, ""Can we push this back? Let's give this a try give it another 3 weeks, we're doing well."" Nothing. no answer.

The Night before zero hour, she leaves. No call, no show, I'm up all night. Bottle of scotch in my hand. I'm petrified, we're back to square one, the rocks are looming, the storms started up again. The kind of sleepless anxiety, with tired red eyes, waiting to see the light in the driveway, the headlights never came. I watched the sunrise that morning, one of those hot muggy Virginia sunrises. The lurid reds, pinks, orange, yellow, seeped in over the horizon mixed together through the humidity and spilled honey over the yard, slow a steady stream a flow to the home. She never came home that night. I knew why. The phone rang about 9:30, her voice, hoarse from cigarettes, asks me to breakfast.

We meet, she’s disheveled, her hair is crazy, her eyes sunk, full of tears and anger, she smells like sex, cigarettes, semen, and she's straight out. ""I cheated on you last night, he fucked me, and I wanted him to do it"". I fumbled “why? “, ""we're over, I don't want you, I don't want this, I want to be free"". I knew who it was; it was the friend’s roommate the washed out emo fucker. Four hours later I sat in the clinic on a bench, the room was full of sad faces, terrified faces, confused faces, she asked the attendees not to allow anyone in. I wanted to hold her hand, I wanted to hold her and tell her it would be okay, that this would pass, that I love her. But I couldn't, my only solace was the cold tile floors staring back at me. I knew somewhere behind those doors a little bit of us disappeared that morning. We named him/her lizard, the photo's still around somewhere. She didn't come out until after I'd left, the nurses kept tabs. She came home that evening I held her and we cried.

 I loved that girl more than anything, we took months to work through the trauma, until as it would be, she cheated again.. That however, is another story.

I don't know where I went wrong. I want, so badly, to be someone someone wants or loves. I want to have someone who wants to hang out and do nothing and be okay with that because we'd still have fun talking. I want someone who thinks I'm okay. I want a man who thinks I'm ridiculously sexy who isn't just faking it and pretending because he's lonely and just wants someone to tell him how good in bed he is. I want someone, anyone just to hug me and mean it because they love me. Not just because they feel bad for me because I had a shitty upbringing. I want someone to love me for me... But.. There's a reason no one does or has.. Or probably will.. I just wish I could figure out what it is and change it so someone will, eventually, someday, maybe want me, too. 

I do try really hard. I give what I can, I am a good listener and supporter, I focus on other people... I just must give off a bad person vibe or am a terrible person and I just don't realize it.

I want to have someone who wants to hang out and do nothing and be okay with that because we'd still have fun talking. I want someone who thinks I'm okay. I want a man who thinks I'm ridiculously sexy who isn't just faking it and pretending because he's lonely and just wants someone to tell him how good in bed he is. I want someone, anyone just to hug me and mean it because they love me. Not just because they feel bad for me because I had a shitty upbringing. I want someone to love me for me... But.. There's a reason no one does or has.. Or probably will.. I just wish I could figure out what it is and change it so someone will, eventually, someday, maybe want me, too. 

I do try really hard. I give what I can, I am a good listener and supporter, I focus on other people... I just must give off a bad person vibe or am a terrible person and I just don't realize it. I don't know. But there's a reason.",13,6.0,2013-03-26 9:07,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1b16f6/i_know_theres_a_reason/,Neutral
19464,1a7vnz,post,I am someone that no one wants to be around. I don't belong anywhere. Block of text ahead. ,"Not long after I was born my parents got a divorced and my mom gave custody to my dad. Both of them got remarried by the time I was four. I called both my birth-mom and step-mom ""Mom"". This made my birth-mom very upset, and still does to this day. 

Growing up I always hung out with my cousin, a year older than me, and just a fun guy. We would play video games and the like until one day when I was about 6 we started showing each other our cocks. Then it grew to touching and the like, almost every time we hung out. 

I began to do this with the neighbor boys a around age 8 (one year older and one year younger respectively). I never thought it was really wrong, until we got caught. By then I knew it was wrong but I liked it. 

My family moved houses and my sister and brother were born. My mom lived in another state about a 2 hour flight away so I would usually see her once a year for about 2 weeks maybe a month at the most, but called her most weekends. 

My cousin began to come over more often and we would do the same thing, but eventually it got to sucking each other off. One time I didn't want to do it and he threatened to hit me. I had seen him previously hit his little brother and it really scared me so I would do it for him. 

Over this period I started doing the same thing with other kids, younger than me, boys or girls, didn't really matter, if we were touching each other, it was great. I knew it was wrong the whole time, but I just could not stop it. My family made good friends with several other families in the community out of which I was the oldest child. I had touched at least 4 of these kids that I can remember. Possibly more. 

Until the end of my freshman year of high school. I got called out by a one of the girls in this family. Eventually it spread and all the families knew. I was in a hole. At first they didn't want to press charges, but give me a second chance. In an extremely tearful conversation with my father and step mom I admitted to them that it start with my cousin. I lied some and made myself look the victim by saying things like he had hit me, and it was mostly me sucking him off. It was truthfully more often him doing it to me and me running off to avoid doing it to him. 

I was given a small reprieve to go to my mother'sfor two weeks where she asked me to move to her state in another difficult time. I could feel the disappointment from everyone around me. I couldn't go near my step mom because she assumed I had done things to my sister and brother. (5 years younger and 8 years younger respectively). I swear to this day I never touched them or hurt them in anyway. I could never have brought myself to do it, they were my brother and sister, and for some reason in my head it was always just wrong to think that. (I know, it’s weird).

So I come back to my Dad's and I can just feel the anger towards me. My step mom couldn't look at me but my dad helped me through things. We had a small family reunion and everyone knew at that point and I felt so ostracized. It was my first thought of why have I not killed myself yet? I was 15 and I couldn't think of anything else to do. I never ended up doing anything but it was always in the back of my head. 

I was given two options later that year. Move to my mom's or go to a house in Idaho to live until I was 18. I moved to my mom's. 

Now my stepdad and I were never very close. I am rather small, calm and a videogame nerd. He is a military man, works out daily. Opposites. It created a bit of tension and I never really worked things out with him. I finished up high school but the whole time I was there my birth-mom always felt like a woman I lived with, not a mother. I love her, but I often wonder if that is because I am told to. 

I lost my virginity in high school and had various relationships with different girls but it was always the same, I felt guilty when I would ejaculate. It didn't feel right, but I always enjoyed doing things to my girlfriends rather than them doing things to me. I have had sex 8 times with a total of 3 girls, each time I just feel guilty about having it happen and freak out and break up with them. Each time I think it will be different. But its not.

I told this same story to a few close friends, one of which ended up cursing me off and abandoning me in my car as I explained everything through heavy tears. I felt so dejected. I haven't trusted anyone else, minus one person about this since then. 

My dad and step-mom got a divorce halfway through my senior year. It didn't really help me until they showed up at different times and didn't talk to each other at all during my graduation party at my birth-mom's house. It was so awkward. I felt like I needed to entertain everyone, but just couldn't. 

Growing up my grandparents on my step-moms side were always the ones to make the biggest difference in my life behind my dad. I love them so much but now that the divorce occurred I feel like a burden.

Over the past winter break I got into the first fight ever with my birth-mom. She was mad at me and I admitted to her I don't trust her. She says I don't trust her and is offended that I call my step-mom ""Mom"". I feel ashamed that I can't trust my own mother at all. 

I am now studying abroad with a girl. We live together and we are the only ones in the apartment. She has a pretty large crush on me, and is a complete virgin, I was her first kiss. I am not attracted to her but there are times where I come on to her because I am just horny and need something. I recently realized it is the same type of feeling I got when I was younger around those kids. I know it, but for the most part I can't stop it. 

I confessed what I did. Now I want to confess that I hate myself for everything I did. I think about it now and again and it makes me angry that I even did any of that. Let alone to mention that I still want to do it on occasion. I want to die some days, I have thought it through but haven't reached that low. 

I am not the son my mom wants. I am not the son my step mom wants. I don't fit in anywhere I go. I always feel out of place, like I am boring, burdening people with my presence. I love to travel but I can't be alone for very long, it brings bad thoughts. I need help but I don't know what to do. Where to go. What to say. I am tired of hurting people and I don't want to do it anymore. I hate myself.

19465,18vldx,post,I fantasize about becoming a killer,"Let me be clear: I won't act on it. But I can't help but feel like this is a great life:
-Being financially independent (not exorbitantly wealthy, let's say I receive a stipend of $90,000 a year).
-Have a house near the ocean.
-Devote my days to improving my health. Weight-lifting and cardio combined with a strict diet are a must for what I do at night.
-Devote my nights to stalking and killing people.

I'm not some maniac. I care about people, which is why I could never do it. I could never cause a victim's family pain. BUT last year I started fantasizing about killing people with criminal records (specifically targeting child molesters and other low lifes). That seemed a lot more palatable, like something I wouldn't lose sleep over. Plus its a much greater challenge. A worthier prey probably yields a greater rush. I began envisioning becoming proficient at surveillance. There was a halfway house for sex offenders across town. I could pose as a heating and air guy, gain access to the place, set up cameras, microphones, watch all their comings and goings from my home computer for a month. Just watching, waiting, learning all about them, what they did. And then when I was aware enough of all their routines, I could waste them all with a silenced pistol.

I think about finding out where a paroled murderer lives, or a drug dealer, ringing his doorbell, tazing him and walking through the front door. Then I tie him up and when he comes to, ask him about his crime, who he did it to, and why, before strangling him and getting rid of his body.

I haven't thought about it much lately. Mainly because I'm seeing a girl after a four year dry spell, and frankly getting laid and having someone care about me is quelling my homicidal fantasies. That and I'm seeing a therapist. I haven't told my therapist about this because I don't want her to become alarmed over nothing, but I've alluded to having violent urges so we're trying to work through them.

19466,18kcds,post,I'm a rapist and sex offender. ,"About twelve years ago, I was visiting my girlfriend's family's house for christmas. I was a scumbag back then. I'll get that out of the way first. I had no intention of being loyal to my girlfriend.

We were sleeping over that week for the holidays, and her high school aged sister kept flirting with me. I was an addict then so I only really cared about myself and I didn't pick up on other peoples signals well. 

In the middle of the night I snuck out of the room into her sister's room. She was going with it, we were making out, and things were getting heated, we get naked. The next thing I know I was inside her. It was like I blacked out because she was crying, then we fell off the bed and she was screaming at me. Her parents, brother and my girlfriend come in and it's a huge fallout. 

They end up calling the police on me and saying that I snuck into the house. Spent a few years in jail, confessed whatever they told me I did because I didn't give a shit about my life. 

Im a convicted sex offender. My girlfriend kept contact with me through jail and wanted to continue our relationship. I was no longer on drugs. Her sister wrote me a letter saying her family will support me because they knew my actions were of an addict. 

I knew the truth. Yes I was an addict, but that wasn't why I did it, I did it because I didn't care about anyone but myself.

Dated girlfriend again but it didn't last long. sister still contacts me occasionally. Feels guilty and said she didnt want any of that to happen to me she just didn't want to have sex. nothing good can come to talking to her though so I dont engage her

As for jail. Yes those were the worst years of my life but I learned discipline there. Before jail, I had nothing in my life just drugs, sex, pleasure. After jail I learned how to get through a day and fall asleep without that feeling of insanity that you 'need' something to fix you. It might sound simple, but thats the greatest thing i have ever learned how to do.

19468,16dtf3,post,"This is My Story. (In easy to read, dot points.)","Some background:

- I'm 18-19

- I've had 5 ""relationships"" only 2 of those were real (the rest all lasted less than 2 months and never got further than hand holding before they broke up with me).

- Last relationship before this one (the only other ""serious one."") was ended by her for a couple of reasons, one being that I wasn't following through with her sexual advances as much as she would like to. She would tell me that we shouldn't do anything too sexual, but then would put her hand down my pants whenever she could, etc., and get offended if I didn't want to continue with anything. She basically suggested that I would either have sex with her or she would break up with me, so we had it once (neither finished, I stopped it before) and then I would ""forget"" to buy condoms between the times we would see each other. (I don't believe in chastity, but I wanted to only ever have sexual relations with the girl who would be my wife.)


The Story:

I'm really struggling with my most recent break up. She didn't want to have any sexual relations other than kissing until she was married, but she would instigate a lot of stuff. A couple of months into our relationship we would end up making out and dry humping a lot (with very little clothes on). She once gave me oral sex until I orgasmed. One day we had both been completely naked, with her on top of me, letting me hold her up (her vagina was directly above my penis, close enough to be touching each other). 

We didn't let it go further than that. Later, we decided that we were being foolish, and that it wasn't a good idea to continue. So we stopped doing anything other than making out for a while, until one day while we were making out she sat in my lap, facing me and wrapped her legs around me waist and continued making out. We ended up dry humping, and she got really upset (mostly at herself for giving in). And she made me promise to not let it happen again.

It did happen again, slightly differently (not going to go into specifics, but I didn't fully realise that it was the same thing). I felt really bad, afterwards I told her that I would make sure that all those things would never happen again and she agreed and we spent the rest of the afternoon together.

Later that night she called me and broke up with me, because she told me she would if it happened again. She told me she didn't want me to speak to her until she was ready and hung up and we didn't have any communication for 2 weeks, until we went to an event that our friends were all at. She approached me and we talked the same as we always had (neither one of us bringing up what had happened.) we spent the night talking, and we left and didn't speak to each other again for a week.

One night she was up really late on Skype, and I know that she likes to sleep and she was flying to another country in 2 days, so I messaged her saying; ""Be angry at me for sending this message to you, but you should go to sleep.""

She replied, and we had a conversation until I convinced her to go to sleep.

The next day I messaged her asking if that meant we could talk again, she said yes, but not about our relationship.

She went to the other country, we talked as much as we could while she was over there.

And when she came back we started Skype video calling each other every night to talk and say goodnight. (like we always used to).

She's currently in another state visiting her family, and she's told me that I'm her best friend. We still haven't started talking about our relationship or the break up. (I think she wants to do it face to face, which I want to as well.)

I still love her (this post may show her in a bad light, because it's a confession about the break up, but I was definitely in the wrong, and she is a very, very good person. I used to be a very cynical, assholeish guy due to some relationship experiences and whatnot, but she helped me become a much better person, and we click really, really well). But I don't know what to do.

I want her to take me back, but I don't think she will. And as much as I want to, I'm not sure how long I could stay her friend (what happens when she gets a boyfriend?). I'm torn because if she doesn't take me back I want to be there for her, but is it worse to let myself go through watching someone I love, love someone else?

I don't know what to do, and I don't know what I'm going to do if she wants to stay friends.

(Nobody but Reddit knows the full story about any of this.)

She told me she didn't want me to speak to her until she was ready and hung up and we didn't have any communication for 2 weeks, until we went to an event that our friends were all at. She approached me and we talked the same as we always had (neither one of us bringing up what had happened.) we spent the night talking, and we left and didn't speak to each other again for a week.

One night she was up really late on Skype, and I know that she likes to sleep and she was flying to another country in 2 days, so I messaged her saying; ""Be angry at me for sending this message to you, but you should go to sleep.""

She replied, and we had a conversation until I convinced her to go to sleep.

The next day I messaged her asking if that meant we could talk again, she said yes, but not about our relationship.

She went to the other country, we talked as much as we could while she was over there.

And when she came back we started Skype video calling each other every night to talk and say goodnight. (like we always used to).

She's currently in another state visiting her family, and she's told me that I'm her best friend. We still haven't started talking about our relationship or the break up. (I think she wants to do it face to face, which I want to as well.)

I still love her (this post may show her in a bad light, because it's a confession about the break up, but I was definitely in the wrong, and she is a very, very good person. I used to be a very cynical, assholeish guy due to some relationship experiences and whatnot, but she helped me become a much better person, and we click really, really well). But I don't know what to do.

I want her to take me back, but I don't think she will. And as much as I want to, I'm not sure how long I could stay her friend (what happens when she gets a boyfriend?). I'm torn because if she doesn't take me back I want to be there for her, but is it worse to let myself go through watching someone I love, love someone else?

I don't know what to do, and I don't know what I'm going to do if she wants to stay friends.

(Nobody but Reddit knows the full story about any of this.)

TL;DR: I'm an idiot who made a mistake with a girl that I love, wondering what to do.",1,10.0,2013-01-11 15:53,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/16dtf3/this_is_my_story_in_easy_to_read_dot_points/,Neutral
19469,1i5nt87,post,I was insensitive today and I regret it. I just need to get it off my chest. ,"I’m in a county in Los Angeles. It was not affected by the wild fires but did have warnings. 

I was on my way back from Christmas, and the amount of smoke I saw driving over there, the amount of videos I’ve seen of people visiting and recording the destruction, all the news, the fires trucks I passed by, it was all so awful and devastating. I had never been near something so crazy.

Curiosity got the best of me the next day, and I decided to drive there and take a look. Of course where the fires had moved on. I had never seen anything like this, so I drove about 35 minutes into the city and went into a neighborhood. Two houses were burnt down and it was so shocking to me to see in real life how the damage was to the building.

And officer told me to leave, I panicked and said I was “looking for my cat” which…. what the fuck was that excuse? Why would I blurt that out? I then promptly turned around to leave the neighborhood like he said to, as I left, I passed by another few houses.

And that’s where a woman walks in front of my car, I roll down my window, and she has tears in her eyes. She asks “are you a resident here?” And I panic and I lie. I tell her I live in the neighborhood over and god I feel so terrible. She says “this isn’t for looksies. This was my home and it was destroyed.” I apologize and cry to her. I tell her I’m so sorry, because it dawned on me right there, that it was selfish of me. The drive home was so upsetting because I can’t believe I let my curiosity get to me like that.

I’m still here, the next day, and I feel nauseous. I did not mean to be insensitive and I’m so so utterly sorry to that woman. Am I a terrible human??? I will never do that ever again.","I was insensitive today and I regret it. I just need to get it off my chest.  I’m in a county in Los Angeles.

19470,1i5j1j4,post,Got used by 2 guys in the same month I’m actually going insane ,"So this just happened fairly recently, this month. My birth month unfortunately. Anyways, it started with one guy we shall call him JIM. I met jim at a bar downtown in late December. Me being an easy person to sway immediately got swooned by his efforts to start talking to me. He asked for my phone to put his number in it, his # is now in my phone. We start talking all seems well. He’s asking to get my finger sized (weird but wtv). Promising all these other things like your problems are now mine blah blah straight bs. Don’t know how I listened to him. Moving on he is at my place and things start to get heated. We end up engaging in the boombayah and all is still well. Next day rolls around he’s getting distant I’m like I see where this is going but imma just leave it cause I’m over this. He completely ghosts me. I unadd his ass and come to the realization that he just wanted me for my scrumdidlyumptious body. (If I don’t joke I will lose my mind bear with me people). 

Now fast forward to last week. A couple weeks from the incident with Jim. I jokingly join facebook dating I’m not taking it seriously I just need an ego boost because I just lost all my dignity to a wannabe cowboy. I don’t even like country I’m a city girl. I meet this guy who is gonna be called Jam. (Cause that’s what I wanna do to his head in a door). He adds me on the iconic snap, I hate snap I’m old enough to prefer text at this point. We start hitting it off and he then wants to see me. So we hangout, we have a lot in common and I’m genuinely like okay I think I like this guy. We hangout again two days later. We also do the boombayah, which I need to not allow myself to do no more unless we are in a relationship for fucks sake. Call me a hoe if you will but I’m secretly a lover girl with a mad broken heart. After our little activity in the back of my damn car we part ways and all is going good. I’m starting to like this guy now and he wants a relationship. We make plans to go downtown on the upcoming saturday of that week. This is where shit hits the fan. Plot twist my guy. I go over to his to pregame because alcohol at bars just be a money grabber. He goes on his phone and I take a gander over noticing a familiar bitmoji (ew). Lo and behold it’s Jim. You are joking. I say out loud that’s the guy who used me a couple weeks ago. I should’ve just shut my ass up and not said a word but either way it was gonna get out. Better if I say so myself. Now we are talking homeboy beside me immediately gets distant. And I’m thinking this ain’t good. I feel the urge to cry I go to the bathroom the tears are rolling I need to go back and drink some more. He starts speaking when I enter and I just break down. His response: why are you crying? Why am I crying? Cause your homeboy caused me distress and now I gotta go through it again. Anyways he’s making this situation about himself like he was the one who was hit on and dumped. Talking about how his friends are going to clown him and all this which I genuinely don’t give a fuck man sorry. I’ve known you for a week and you’re already showing me red flags. I say to him if you did genuinely like me you wouldn’t care what your friends think. I already have him clocked I already see what’s coming like I’m batman saving the city. We go downtown he’s in a pissy mood which ruins my mood and I just wanna get away from him and disappear. He tells me at some point that Jim is texting him. Jim knows, fuck you Jim. Jam says that he’s saying some very disrespectful things about me like ofc he is cause he’s lost all of dis. I ask what he’s saying Jam doesn’t want to tell me but all he says is Jim called me his sloppy seconds. Seconds sounds about right cause it was like 1 and done. Easy bake oven brownies. That’s how I would describe his time management. I’m pissed at this point because I found out Jim is talking to new chick. So you can come ruin a good time for me after you already did what you did but you can go and clown around with no repercussions. You dumb mf. I already know Jam is going to drop me I kept talking about it for the rest of the night cause I’m not stupid, you’re planning on doing me the same since you found out. I finally get home and guess who was right. Me. I see he blocked me like that’s gonna do something. I wasn’t planning on entertaining you anymore anyways. So now I’m just at the point where I am in so much distraught I cant look at a man, believe one or even talk to any because I’m so disappointed in them.

Also I apologize for all of this I will be joining therapy I just need my fellow community members to know what I’ve been through and hopefully just support me in this.

I often feign my pride saying, 'I really liked it, but' and then give a point where I feel the human touch is missing; but I feel like that undermines the entire point and instills wrong values in my stepkid. So now here I am being fucked up about it.

Edit: I'm adding this so people don't reply with the obvious; I've given them art supplies, art kits, robot kits, 3d printing pens, lego kits, LEGOS WITH LEDS BUILT IN, pearler beads, pixo bits, nano blocks, acrylic marble kits, etc etc etc.

19474,1i5danm,post,ND (Negligent Discharge) I shot my truck! USA Gun Owner fucks up but gets lucky,"First let me start out saying no body was seriously harmed or killed in this incident!!!

So going on 48 hours ago I got myself a handgun for my 25th bday present. I've been shooting since I was 5 and have always loved to shoot and collect firearms so I felt really confident and experienced in handling them. Well after getting it from to a family members house and removing all the tags, doing a weapons check, and loading a mag I was feeling really happy about my newest gun. Now I knew I wasn't going to carry it that day so to make sure I was being responsible and safe I took the mag out and cleared the gun. 

Well I get into my truck and something is nagging at me that the gun isn't safe or cleared like I thought it was. Not wanting to chance a ND (Negligent Discharge) I took it out of the case and double checked there wasn't a mag and racked the slide again. Now here is where things get fuzzy because of how fast it all happened. After the slide is racked and returns to battery it goes of. I am certain my finger wasn't on the trigger but I am also not stupid enough to not rule out my own personal negligence. 

Regardless the gun goes off left is is ringing and for a few seconds I can't hear anything. I check the gun and it is now completely safe as the slide is not locked into place and in the open position. I then set the gun down on the passenger seat and check myself, got lucky as I wasn't shot. I check in front of me and...fuck there's a brand new hole in my windshield that's 9mm shaped. I get out and even more luckily a tree about 10 yards away caught the bullet and not the neighbors house behind it. 

I have felt like an absolute dumbass and like a bad gun owner. For 20 years I have always remained myself of the rules to gun safety and always double, triple, and even quadruple check that a gun is empty before handing it. I feel like I don't deserve the gun because of this but I also know I got luckier than most people. Anyways I'll end this rant with this bit of advice. 

ALWAYS REMEMBER GUN SAFETY AND ITS RULES BUT NEVER FORGET THAT ACCIDENT WILL HAPPEN. ","ND (Negligent Discharge) I shot my truck! USA Gun Owner fucks up but gets lucky First let me start out saying no body was seriously harmed or killed in this incident!!!

The first guy pissed me off cause while he was flirting with me, he had been hanging out with my ex gf 
The other guy had a major glow up from when I first knew him and so many girls like him now and he even had a gf who seems way out of his league 
I’ve had multiple dreams abt me kissing girls and I ended up getting drunk and kissed my fb teammate after a match after confessing to her that I liked her 2 years ago 
And I recently had a dream abt the first guy and me on a bike and me hugging him from behind. 
I also get kinda mad when I see the first guy posting stories abt hanging out with this new girl cause he only follows 5 of his female friends online 
And I also can’t help but stalking the second guy and his gf 

The thing is even when I liked the first guy, I never intended on getting into a relationship with him. The second guy I don’t even consider these feelings as me liking him cause he never gives me ‘those’ feelings and used to make me uncomfortable sometimes if I’m being honest.
And the girl I kissed - I actually despise her 

I don’t want these ppl to affect me but the two guys were genuinely my closest friends at some point and I’m scared to lose them.","I’m really confused about what I should do to be a good person  My bf and I have been dating for almost a year and a half

19478,1i50oih,post,I got away from doing my math project I never started,"Back in 7th grade when I was 12 or so, I had this math class which I really hated. The teacher mean, not in the sense of I just didn’t like him but in the sense where he’ll get mad if you didn’t understand how to answer a question, he even recorded me not answering a question in the beginning of class and showed he recorded me wanting me to react and I cried. Well one of the class projects we were assigned was making a bridge out of toothpicks, sounds fun… but for me, it just sounds so boring and tedious, so when I got my supplies, I just never took it home, it staying in my locker. A month passes and it’s time to show off our work and when it came to my turn, I lied and said my dog (Paloma) destroyed it and of course he didn’t believe me. He was gonna yell at me and call my parents, til MY BLOODY SAVIOR chimed up and backed me up saying he believed me. He was part of the picture club, was very liked by the students and staff, so very high trust, and has met my dog and agreed she was very hyperactive and said I was saying the truth, I got a C for that project, THANK YOU HUMBERTO. After that, in the end of the day I took my bridge supplies and hid it in my bag, one of my classmates saw me do that realizing I lied but he also didn’t say anything, like I said, the teacher was mean.","I got away from doing my math project I never started Back in 7th grade when I was 12 or so, I had this math class which I really hated.

19479,1i4z8m8,post,"I was touched as a kid, but I lied about what happened. ","I was probably somewhere 9 years old (2010) when my biological father wanted to try to fix his relationship with me and my brother since he left us in 2005 for another woman. My brother never wanted to, but I tried to give my dad a chance. So he invited me to stay with him and his “family” (with the woman she left us for, along with its two boys) so we can ‘get along’ or something.

Let’s call the boys John and Stewart. John was older, he was somewhere around 11-12 y.o., and Stewart was 6 or 7y.o. (he is irrelevant to the story anyway so doesn’t matter). 

I’ve went to their house once, and kind of had fun. Then went again for the second time for a whole weekend (I think, I can’t remember clearly) so I had longer time with them. John, was mainly my playmate but at some point, this is where it started to be weird. We reached a point where we couldn’t think of what to play anymore. As we were thinking, he suggested, enthusiastically, “let’s have sex!”. I was pretty shocked when he said it, as I know it’s not a good idea to do. My mom is pretty open with topics like this so I always knew the idea of sex or what it does, at least. I told him, “No, why would we? What if I get pregnant?” and he just responded with “No you won’t, I had friends back then that did it and they never got pregnant.” But I still said no. I didn’t want to. But he still insisted in touching me while playing a game. I was afraid of saying ‘no’ as a kid since it would always lead to me being the bad kid. So even though I really didn’t want to, I still let him since he was being forceful about it. I feel so stupid thinking about it. It still haunts me to this day.

We played cards, and everytime someone loses a guess or whatever (I don’t remember what we were playing exactly) either would touch each other. Whenever he would win, he had this creepy look in his face that would be so happy when he’s going to touch me. And when I would win, he would make me touch his. I can’t even think about this without my body shaking. I hate it. I didn’t want it but I feel like I would be hated if I said no. He even made fun of the smell of my parts afterwards. I felt ashamed.

When I went home, even when I was walking away, he was pointing at my thing and mocked me making a “stinky” gesture. I’ve been wanting to tell my mom about it but I was too scared that she might get mad or them. But I couldn’t sleep when we got home and I was crying alone in front of the tv. My mom got worried and she asked me what was happening, I just told her that “John touched me while I was sleeping.” Because I was scared that she might get mad if I told her what really happened. She got mad and she immediately called my biological dad. They had a fight on another day and my biological dad kept forcing me to tell them what happened, but I just kept crying and I couldn’t talk. I feel like shit for lying but I also feel like shit for being touched regardless.

To this day, whenever I’m alone, I still get this weird creepy feeling that I can’t explain whenever I remember what happened. I’m married now and my sex life is normal, but I still can’t forget what that kid did to me. I wish I could just forget that someone else had touched me.

19484,1i4plfm,post,"I lied for 12 years about my identity, but there’s more…","Buckle up, this will be interesting. I met this guy on a game online 12 years ago. At that time I was young and insecure. I “friended” him on this game and we hit it off that evening. We talked for hours about the most random things and ended up becoming close friends. At that time when he asked me for my name, I lied because I knew I shouldn’t tell my name to a random stranger I met online. I figured, if this comes to be something serious, surely I will tell him the truth and everything will be fine. Months passed, and we texted on this online game without revealing our true identities. After all, it was just a game right? It was a place for us to escape from our lives. Both of us grew up in a sort of traumatic household environment, where we felt lonely, unseen, and unheard. It was an escape where we could be whoever we wanted, whatever we wanted, and no one could tell us any different. 

After several months of talking, we decided to move to another platform instead of the game. We started talking on a texting app and somehow didn’t share our real phone numbers with one another. We talked daily, for hours at a time. When it came time to show each other what we looked like, I was scared and I lied. I sent him a random picture of an influencer I found online. I didn’t send many photos, just some here and there. I was afraid that he would not find me attractive as I did not feel attractive at that time at all. It felt so nice to have someone to talk to, someone who could understand me and my troubles and my worries and my hopes and my dreams. We fell deeply in love, even though we had never met in person or heard each other’s voices. Looking back I wonder how it even lasted this long. 

He asked me several times during that time span to come and visit me as he lived multiple states away. I always had an excuse. Something came up, something was wrong, I couldn’t right now. I was so afraid that he would find out the truth and hate me. So we broke up after this, yet we still kept in touch. I thought maybe we would fall apart and he would never find out the truth. But we didn’t. He still wanted to be in my life, even though we both experienced other relationships and moved forward with our lives. We both completed graduate school. I just started a new career recently and felt in a good place emotionally, mentally, and physically. The guilt of that I had chosen to do all those years ago was still eating up at me. I thought about it everyday, but how could I reveal the truth now? It felt like it was too late, and he would hate me. 

In the past 6 months, we talked much more and confessed our love to each other. However, he told me he could not be in a relationship with me right now because of all the trauma of his past. His childhood was hard and he felt he had unhealed triggers to work on that he couldn’t bring into a relationship. Plus, the fact that I rejected him every time he asked to come see me hurt him deeply, he admitted. This made complete sense to me. Keep in mind, we still had not FaceTimed each other or seen each other’s faces in person. I truly don’t know how. It has been 12 years of us knowing each other at this point. The guilt was still eating up at me, and I knew I loved him so much. I thought, how can I expect someone to want to be with me if I’m not even being honest?

The hardest thing I did was admit the truth to him. I told him through a voice recording what I had done. I felt so guilty and horrible. I told him this was why I never let him come see me. Because I was so afraid he would hate me. To my surprise, his response was that he understood, he forgave me, and that I was not a horrible person. I felt shocked. I couldn’t understand this. However, he said knowing this information he knew he had to leave. He couldn’t stay in our friendship anymore. I understood. We had acted as more than friends at that time. 

What i am about to say next is even worse. At this point, I still hadn’t heard his voice even once. He had heard mine multiple times through voice recordings. I had never FaceTimed him (for obvious reasons). Well, I looked up some of the photos he sent me online and found the instagram page that they were posted on. Turns out, those photos were not of him either. I was SHOCKED. He had done the same thing that I had done, all those years ago. He had also lied about his identity. I brought this up to him, and he admitted the truth. He hadn’t been honest either and he said the reason why he asked to see me in person all those times, was so he could finally tell me the truth. He wanted to tell me in person. He said now it was too late. The damage was done. But I said, we did the exact same thing. Do we not owe it to each other to see each other once and for all? He disagreed and told me he didn’t want the truth. He didn’t want to see what I actually looked like or what my real name was. He said it was too late. For some reason, we continued to talk. I guess we both couldn’t leave and the shock was too much all at once to just leave. We talked for weeks after, almost as if none of this had really happened. 

I couldn’t take it anymore. The lying, the dishonesty, the lack of authenticity. I had asked him to tell me the truth about who he was, to call me, to FaceTime me, but he wouldn’t. Finally, I sent him a video of me telling the truth. I told him everything and revealed my identity, even though he had said he didn’t want to know. He was in shock, but he said I was still beautiful on the inside and outside. I was also shocked and sobbing at this point. If only I had told him the truth in the beginning, if only I wasn’t so scared. But would he have still told me his truth? He eventually ended up sending me a voice recording and sent me a few photos of him. However, when I asked him if we could finally see each other in person or FaceTime, he did not want to. 

He said this is over now, and there is too much hurt. He asked me how he could heal in the place that broke him. I understood. It was awful. The ending was awful. He told me that all the times I was in other relationships, he watched me fall in love with other people while he was in love with me. I had no idea he was still in love with me all these times over the years. I asked him why he didn’t want to see me. If we just finally saw each other, wouldn’t everything be okay? We could finally hold each other and apologize in person. 

But he disagreed. In this whole situation, he didn’t want to give me his real phone number. We still talked on the texting app. I asked him why and he said it was because he couldn’t hear my voice again or get closer to me. He said it was too hard. He said he had nothing else to say except “I love you.” So that is how we ended it, with love. 

That was a week ago. I am devastated. I am in shock. I am feeling guilty. There is so much pain. I have no idea what to feel. Were the last photos he sent me real? Why didn’t he want to finally see each other or call each other? I haven’t talked to him in a week. 

I looked today at the app we communicated on to see that he had deleted his account. He also deactivated his email account. This caused me so much pain to see. I cannot stop thinking about this. It keeps replaying in my head. I guess if I were to reach out, he would never even see. So I guess that’s it. The only way he could communicate with me is by texting me on my phone number, which I did give him. I don’t know if he ever will. I don’t know if this is it. 

It hurts and I am trying to forgive myself for making the decisions I made in the past. I was shocked that we both made the same choices and didn’t know until 12 years later. It is insane, I know. I truly do not know what else to say besides it is crazy. However, I know we both loved each other so much. How can you not fall in love with someone you knew for that long? I thought I knew everything about him. 

Side note: all throughout these years, we became best friends. We knew our deepest fears, our worries, our hurt, our longings. We fell deeply in love. We could confide in each other about everything and anything. We made each other laugh so much. We could spend hours talking and the time would fly by too fast. That is what I will miss the most. 

I don’t know how to process this. I don’t know how to feel. No one knows the full story except me and him, and now you all. I don’t know how to recover from this one. 

To him: if you ever see this, I hope one day you do get to heal and you come back and we resolve things, once and for all. I hope we will meet each other one day. I hope that if it is meant to be, it will happen, like we said. I hope you find the courage to tell me your full truth. You know how to reach me. 

To everyone saying he is probably married and to let it go, I am trying. It is obviously so new and so hard. Maybe it was naive of me to think he was my soulmate. I thought he was. We knew each others deepest parts, or so I thought. I knew about his childhood, his hurt, his pain, his fears, his wonders, his dreams, everything. I can only wish the best for him. I adored him. I loved him with every part of me. He said there was too much pain here and I agree. There was a lot of pain in the end, especially seeing how we both lied. I just wish I had gotten full closure, but someone here said closure is overrated. Maybe it is. I just want to move forward now. I hope I will. I had to get this off my chest, and thank you to every single person who has been supportive, kind, and understanding. It means so much that some of you have gone through something similar and to know that I am not alone in this. Thank you for the support. ","I lied for 12 years about my identity, but there’s more… Buckle up, this will be interesting. I met this guy on a game online 12 years ago. At that time I was young and insecure. I “friended” him on this game and we hit it off that evening. We talked for hours about the most random things and ended up becoming close friends. At that time when he asked me for my name, I lied because I knew I shouldn’t tell my name to a random stranger I met online. I figured, if this comes to be something serious, surely I will tell him the truth and everything will be fine. Months passed, and we texted on this online game without revealing our true identities. After all, it was just a game right? It was a place for us to escape from our lives. Both of us grew up in a sort of traumatic household environment, where we felt lonely, unseen, and unheard. It was an escape where we could be whoever we wanted, whatever we wanted, and no one could tell us any different. 

After several months of talking, we decided to move to another platform instead of the game. We started talking on a texting app and somehow didn’t share our real phone numbers with one another. We talked daily, for hours at a time. When it came time to show each other what we looked like, I was scared and I lied. I sent him a random picture of an influencer I found online. I didn’t send many photos, just some here and there. I was afraid that he would not find me attractive as I did not feel attractive at that time at all. It felt so nice to have someone to talk to, someone who could understand me and my troubles and my worries and my hopes and my dreams. We fell deeply in love, even though we had never met in person or heard each other’s voices. Looking back I wonder how it even lasted this long. 

He asked me several times during that time span to come and visit me as he lived multiple states away. I always had an excuse. Something came up, something was wrong, I couldn’t right now. I was so afraid that he would find out the truth and hate me. So we broke up after this, yet we still kept in touch. I thought maybe we would fall apart and he would never find out the truth. But we didn’t. He still wanted to be in my life, even though we both experienced other relationships and moved forward with our lives. We both completed graduate school. I just started a new career recently and felt in a good place emotionally, mentally, and physically. The guilt of that I had chosen to do all those years ago was still eating up at me. I thought about it everyday, but how could I reveal the truth now? It felt like it was too late, and he would hate me. 

In the past 6 months, we talked much more and confessed our love to each other. However, he told me he could not be in a relationship with me right now because of all the trauma of his past. His childhood was hard and he felt he had unhealed triggers to work on that he couldn’t bring into a relationship. Plus, the fact that I rejected him every time he asked to come see me hurt him deeply, he admitted. This made complete sense to me. Keep in mind, we still had not FaceTimed each other or seen each other’s faces in person. I truly don’t know how. It has been 12 years of us knowing each other at this point. The guilt was still eating up at me, and I knew I loved him so much. I thought, how can I expect someone to want to be with me if I’m not even being honest?

The hardest thing I did was admit the truth to him. I told him through a voice recording what I had done. I felt so guilty and horrible. I told him this was why I never let him come see me. Because I was so afraid he would hate me. To my surprise, his response was that he understood, he forgave me, and that I was not a horrible person. I felt shocked. I couldn’t understand this. However, he said knowing this information he knew he had to leave. He couldn’t stay in our friendship anymore. I understood. We had acted as more than friends at that time. 

What i am about to say next is even worse. At this point, I still hadn’t heard his voice even once. He had heard mine multiple times through voice recordings. I had never FaceTimed him (for obvious reasons). Well, I looked up some of the photos he sent me online and found the instagram page that they were posted on. Turns out, those photos were not of him either. I was SHOCKED. He had done the same thing that I had done, all those years ago. He had also lied about his identity. I brought this up to him, and he admitted the truth. He hadn’t been honest either and he said the reason why he asked to see me in person all those times, was so he could finally tell me the truth. He wanted to tell me in person. He said now it was too late. The damage was done. But I said, we did the exact same thing. Do we not owe it to each other to see each other once and for all? He disagreed and told me he didn’t want the truth. He didn’t want to see what I actually looked like or what my real name was. He said it was too late. For some reason, we continued to talk. I guess we both couldn’t leave and the shock was too much all at once to just leave. We talked for weeks after, almost as if none of this had really happened. 

I couldn’t take it anymore. The lying, the dishonesty, the lack of authenticity. I had asked him to tell me the truth about who he was, to call me, to FaceTime me, but he wouldn’t. Finally, I sent him a video of me telling the truth. I told him everything and revealed my identity, even though he had said he didn’t want to know. He was in shock, but he said I was still beautiful on the inside and outside. I was also shocked and sobbing at this point. If only I had told him the truth in the beginning, if only I wasn’t so scared. But would he have still told me his truth? He eventually ended up sending me a voice recording and sent me a few photos of him. However, when I asked him if we could finally see each other in person or FaceTime, he did not want to. 

He said this is over now, and there is too much hurt. He asked me how he could heal in the place that broke him. I understood. It was awful. The ending was awful. He told me that all the times I was in other relationships, he watched me fall in love with other people while he was in love with me. I had no idea he was still in love with me all these times over the years. I asked him why he didn’t want to see me. If we just finally saw each other, wouldn’t everything be okay? We could finally hold each other and apologize in person. 

But he disagreed. In this whole situation, he didn’t want to give me his real phone number. We still talked on the texting app. I asked him why and he said it was because he couldn’t hear my voice again or get closer to me. He said it was too hard. He said he had nothing else to say except “I love you.” So that is how we ended it, with love. 

That was a week ago. I am devastated. I am in shock. I am feeling guilty. There is so much pain. I have no idea what to feel. Were the last photos he sent me real? Why didn’t he want to finally see each other or call each other? I haven’t talked to him in a week. 

I looked today at the app we communicated on to see that he had deleted his account. He also deactivated his email account. This caused me so much pain to see. I cannot stop thinking about this.

19487,1i4f6yd,post,I lied to my parents that I'm not sharing an apartment with a male friend on our trip.,"

I'm 23F traveling to Japan the coming May with a friend of mine 26M. To make this clear we are both not sexually attracted to each other and there is no tension between us as such. We met at a yoga institue while training to be teachers. We share philosophies, jokes, are upfront to one another. He's respectful and sensitive. I've known him for over an year now and I trust him.
Now, we've already booked an airbnb which is quite spacious and has two separate beds, thus, no sharing. We don't intend to. I was having a conversation with my parents and they had been fine with the whole decision until now when they suddenly became worried and started to go through a list of precautions. Amongst those they said that I should have a room to myself and I said that I'd keep it in mind while booking for hotels. 
The thing is I feel bad for lying to them but I know the truth will absolutely flip them off their butts. They trust me a 1000% when it comes to setting physical boundaries but they don't know my friend the way I do.
I could ask him to cancel the bookings to the room and look for a new one ( which would mind you, be much more expensive. We are on a tight budget) but I don't want to come off hesitant and sheepish to him either.
I know within my heart nothing would happen but because I've been so frank with my parents all my life, I feel guilty for lying to them.","I lied to my parents that I'm not sharing an apartment with a male friend on our trip.

19489,1i4dw0l,post,"Teachers forced me to pull up my skirt to prove to them I had shorts on, I was 13.","Mention of: child on child sa and sa

This was March 2022 and I was into the whole “alternative” look. So, I would wear skirts that were a little too short for school, and I can admit that.

I was in my math class, just messing around with my friends. I was then called out of the class room by the 8th grade science teacher and her assistant, at that time I had no idea who they were and what their names were.

Right as I walked into the hallway, I was imitating told to lift up my skirt. Like one would do, I told them no and that there’s other students in the hallway and i’m uncomfortable. After us going back and forth for less than a minute, I lifted up my skirt to just get it over with.

I went back into class, trying not to cry from feeling embarrassed and dirty. My friends were asking me what was wrong, I wrote what happened on a paper, they took turns passing it to each other, and then my (male) math teacher came up to me and yelled at me for saying what happened and “They don’t need to know what happened”. 

I was already dealing with being sexually assaulted by a kid in my class for 3 months and then continued for another 3 months after that, but that’s a different story. So with the anxiety I had going to school because of that, made everything so much worse.

I later called my dad to pick me up from school. My mom, who obviously would be upset, called the principal. All my mom got as a response is to switch schools that are 30min-1hr away from where we live and that they won’t do anything about what just happened.

I’m now 16 and a sophomore in high school. The science teacher and assistant retired, along with my principal getting fired that next year. Last year the kid was reported for sa from many other students and they let him switch schools so no legal issues happened.","Teachers forced me to pull up my skirt to prove to them I had shorts on, I was 13.

19492,1i49di1,post,No more onion groin or armpit smell!!! Antibacterial Spray ,"Edit:
I never thought people would be so bothered by something that works for ME😂😂

I've struggled with smelling like onions for over 20 years! My vaginal area and armpits smelled of onions no matter how many times I washed and lathered myself in products! 

Well, I realized I sweat a lot and sweat can hold  bacteria (we all have different bacteria types) which can have horrible odors. 

I found antibacterial spray, the kind that we spray on cuts, it should say ""98% or 99% kills bacteria"".
 After your shower or bath, spray whatever area stinks (not in vaginal opening) let it dry then add deodorant! On very active days I add deodorant around my groin area otherwise just the spray. 

It works!!!!! I go all day smelling great! I took a 2 hour intense dance class, I was sweaty but no smell!!! 

I've been to so many doctors, tried different diets, changed my underwear, I drank tons of water, use probiotics, so on and so on. Sometimes the answers are simple.


I HOPE this can help someone! 
Due to my odor issues I've secluded myself from people and had low self-esteem! 

So I truly hope IF this is one of your issues this can be an option for you too.

19494,1i4301t,post,I can’t get him out of my head even after all this time. ,"Throwaway because if my people knew this is how I felt about a man I would be roasted lol. 
Circa 2010 I met a guy online who was everything I could have wanted in a man; a gentleman, funny, handsome, and topped off with a southern drawl that was smooth like honey
A few years went by and we met in person. He flew to my country. It was electric. Chemistry off the charts. 
I ended up having to fly to Texas for a week and he just happened to be there too, so we saved on a hotel together.
A year later, it just so happened we had flights layover at the same time in an airport across the world where we live, so we went for coffee and a hot heavy kiss. 
After that, I flew to where he was stationed where we spent a weekend tangled up in bedsheets and out of breathe. 
This was the last time I saw him. 
It just felt all so special, so kismet. 
We kind of went down different life paths, but that doesn’t mean I don’t think of him more often than I’d like to admit, and crave the kind of relationship we had. It was so easy, the flow just didn’t stop. I’ve kissed him in more countries than I’ve kissed any one person in different countries.

I just need to put this into the techno cloud in the sky because it hurts my heart to think of this amazing type of love I had and although it was never anything official, it was real and it was life changing. 

Im 31F and this happened all throughout my whole 20’s. ","I can’t get him out of my head even after all this time.  Throwaway because if my people knew this is how I felt about a man I would be roasted lol.

19495,1i42jfe,post,I'm not sure if I did the right thing you tell me please.,So I have been dating this guy for almost 3 years. He would accasionally have what he calls a slump. Which Is a depressive episode where he ignores everyone even me. Most times it would only be for a week or so. But this time it has been going on for 6 months. I've maybe heard from him 3 times since I last saw him. I've been loyal to him waiting for him to return texting him when I needed him but got no answer. I've seen him online playing games with friends and he can't even check on me. Usually in his episodes he avoids friends too so it's confusing.  It's okay if he lost feelings he can just admit it that's okay. I just had major surgery on my leg. I gotta relearn how to walk and do basic things and I told him I need him. He hasn't once checked on me. Not when I was in the hospital having complications to when I could start using the muscles in my leg again. I get he's got alot going on and he won't open up but it hurts like hell not hearing from the one you care about when you need them the most. So I did something and I broke up with him. Yes I regret leaving but it was breaking me so much inside. Trying to reach out to getting left on read. Messaging him when I'm crying cuz I need him and he's nowhere to be seen. I've stayed loyal cuz I've been waited for him to come back and cuz I still care about him. But it broke me to the point I don't see my self worth anymore. I always think I'm bothering people and I feel like I don't deserve nobody. He has no idea how I feel cuz I can't find the words to tell him and I doubt he would read what I gotta say.

19496,1i42h1g,post,I can’t keep doing this. Im a horrible person………….,"I can’t take it anymore 

Hey, I am 15m and I can't take the lies anymore so l have to share them. For the past 6 years I've wanted to kms. I'm not being bullied or abused so I have no reason to be this way right? If I'm truly being honest I genuinely hate everything and everyone. If I meet anybody I will immediately find every flaw and insecurity they have and constantly think bad about them. 

I was raised to be nice to everyone but it's getting harder and harder the more I'm near people. I have 4 friends let's call them M R V and N. I hate every last one of them. But I hate myself the most because I'm worthless. I can't talk to girls, I can't own up to my mistakes, i can barely keep my grades up, im ugly, no social skills, and im a nobody. I'm different from everybody else. Not in the ""your special and different"" way, in the outcast and loner way. 

Out of all my friends I hate all of them but l'll tell you why I hate the main 4. l hate M because she's too nice to people who don't deserve it and it hurts me knowing I can't ever help because she never takes the advice she asks for. I hate V because he's so so annoying and acts so tough when he's really just an average kid. I hate N because no matter what situation he always acts like he's better than the rest of the group and school and with that he's never supportive of anything we do.

But R I hate him the most because he knows that I'm worthless but still wants to be my friend. He knows I'm nobody special, he knows I'm socially awkward and quiet. He knows all this but if I act normal around him and don't put on my happy little act and dance around for their amusement he will start to degrade and destroy all the confidence I built up just to be myself. I pretend to be happy and act like a silly and fun guy but I know I’m not. Wanna know the worst part??? 

I'm a people pleaser so l do nothing but help and help and help knowing that I'm a horrible person. The only reason I help others it to boost my ego and try to make myself believe I’m a good person. All I wanna do is be alone but if I'm alone I'm depressed and if I'm with friends I would rather curl up into a ball and die than listen to the stupid things they ask me. All I do everyday is jump around and be silly all to make everyone laugh and be happy. All I do is get good enough grades to make sure my mom won't worry. 

All I do is everything to keep the people around me safe and happier than me because I know how it feels to be left out, alone, scared, sad, worthless, helpless. I make up stories in my head about  finding love and having the perfect life. But I can't have that. I even make up the STUPID life lesson I would follow in real life

 “ being a good person isn’t about non violence and kindness, it’s about doing what you need to protect everyone you care about” “even if your worthless you can still see worth in other people” I would follow them like they where my last hope at ever being happy but it wouldn’t work. No matter how long I stayed up making up scenarios for any situation I still mess up. I still fail. The worst part is l've been sick for 3 weeks and I can't even tell my mom because she doesn't have enough money to take me to the hospital. I've been nauseous, almost pass out multiple times a day, no appetite, headaches, random soreness in any part of my body. But that's ok because I do it all for everyone. If I can't be happy then I will make sure they are before I leave this world. 



Thx for all of your support. I didn’t think this would get any attention. I usually bottle up my emotions so I use this app to blow off some steam so I don’t end up hurting the people I’m around. They all trust me with their secrets and stuff so I don’t wanna end up using those against them or telling everyone.

I’m going to try to start talking to an online therapist so I can get better. Still won’t talk to my mom about it tho because I don’t want her to worry.  Anyways I’m grateful for all of you even my 1 hate comment. I’ll hopefully update you guys later on.","I can’t keep doing this. Im a horrible person…………. I can’t take it anymore

19498,1i41o10,post,Sometimes I don't see the point in being here. I am tired.,"I have kids and a family I love dearly but for most of ny life *from childhood* I have suffered from anxiety, depression, low mood, low confidence and low self esteem. My view of the world is bleak and the fear of any happiness or success I have is sullied by the fear that it will be taken away or something bad will happen.

I fear for myself and loved ones dying through illness or accident or suffering in any way. 

 After a difficult childhood and my sister nearly dying as a child in an accident then having an abusive relationship from my teens to mid twenties things have been really dark for me and honestly my kids are the only things keeping me here.

I have attended many counseling/ therapy sessions and mental health interventions over the years but our mental health system is very under funded and under resourced so a lot of professional help I have received I have had to pay for out of pocket or I've had to wait on the huge public list.  

I have been on medication since I was 16 and I have had many referrals for treatment and evaluations and I have since been diagnosed with BPD as well as anxiety disorder and depressive episodes. 

It's physically, mentally and emotionally exhuasting and a lot of my personal relationships have suffered, I don't have much of a social life and my friend circle is small because loving less people means less pain when you lose someone you love.

 I cry almost on a daily basis and the feeling of staying in bed is almost overwhelming at times. 
My kids keep me accountable because I am needed and they will always be my priority but as a human-being the burden of responsibilty and obligation of being a parent whilst struggling is immense.

To anyone else who feels like me or is suffering with their own mental and emotional health journies:
I see you.

19501,1i3zrm1,post,"I Said No, and He Did It Anyway—I’m Struggling to Process","Hey everyone,

I need to get this off my chest because I’ve been replaying it in my head, and I don’t know how to feel. I went on a date recently with someone I thought was sweet and kind, but it ended up being one of the most confusing and upsetting experiences of my life.

We met up, and he picked me up in his car. It already felt a little isolating since it was just us, but I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt. Almost immediately, he started grabbing my hand. I let go because I felt nervous, but he kept grabbing it again and again. When I didn’t hold his hand, he asked, “Why won’t you hold my hand?” like it was my fault for not wanting to.

Later, while we were parked, he leaned in to kiss me. I shook my head, said “no,” and pulled away, but he grabbed my head and said, “It’s okay, it’s okay,” and kissed me anyway. It wasn’t a soft or mutual kiss—it was rough. He pressed his lips hard into mine, told me to “open your mouth,” and forced his tongue into my mouth. I didn’t want to, but I did it because I felt like I had no choice. I wanted him to like me, and in that moment, I felt powerless to say no again.

He didn’t stop there. He kissed my neck without asking, kept his hand on my thigh, and then started sliding his hand up my dress. My legs were crossed, but his hand still went between my thighs—he was only a few inches from touching me somewhere even more intimate. He also grabbed and squeezed my thigh and touched my side close to my chest. It felt so invasive, but I froze because I didn’t know how to stop it.

What made it even worse were the things he said. He told me, “You’re so pretty, you make it hard for me to control myself,” as if it was my fault he couldn’t respect my boundaries. He said, “I’m a man, and you’re very attractive,” like that excused his behavior.

After the date, I texted him that I missed him because I was trying so hard to convince myself that this was normal. His response? “I’m still really horny.” That broke me. It made me realize how little he cared about me as a person.

The next day, I tried to set boundaries. I told him I wanted to slow things down because I wasn’t comfortable with how fast everything moved. His response? “I just don’t think I’ll be able to control myself enough for you to be comfortable.” Then he told me we were on “different paths” and ended things.

Now, I keep hearing myself say “no” and him saying “It’s okay, it’s okay” over and over again. I feel so confused and violated. I didn’t want any of this, but I also feel like I let it happen because I froze and wanted him to like me. I keep wondering if this is normal or if I’m overreacting because it wasn’t rape.

Am I wrong for feeling this way?

TL;DR:

I went on a date where the guy ignored my boundaries and made me feel violated. I said “no” when he tried to kiss me, but he grabbed my head, said “It’s okay,” and kissed me anyway. His kisses were rough, and he kept telling me to “open my mouth” so he could force tongue kisses. He also kissed my neck, slid his hand up my dress, and touched my thigh and side without consent. He made comments like, “You’re so pretty, you make it hard for me to control myself,” which felt manipulative.

After the date, I texted him that I missed him, and all he said was, “I’m still really horny.” When I tried to set boundaries the next day, he said, “I don’t think I’ll be able to control myself enough for you to be comfortable,” and ended things. I feel confused and violated but keep questioning if I’m overreacting because it wasn’t rape.

Was this normal for a first date? Am I wrong for feeling like this?","I Said No, and He Did It Anyway—I’m Struggling to Process Hey everyone,

I need to get this off my chest because I’ve been replaying it in my head, and I don’t know how to feel. I went on a date recently with someone I thought was sweet and kind, but it ended up being one of the most confusing and upsetting experiences of my life.

We met up, and he picked me up in his car. It already felt a little isolating since it was just us, but I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt. Almost immediately, he started grabbing my hand. I let go because I felt nervous, but he kept grabbing it again and again. When I didn’t hold his hand, he asked, “Why won’t you hold my hand?” like it was my fault for not wanting to.

Later, while we were parked, he leaned in to kiss me. I shook my head, said “no,” and pulled away, but he grabbed my head and said, “It’s okay, it’s okay,” and kissed me anyway. It wasn’t a soft or mutual kiss—it was rough. He pressed his lips hard into mine, told me to “open your mouth,” and forced his tongue into my mouth. I didn’t want to, but I did it because I felt like I had no choice. I wanted him to like me, and in that moment, I felt powerless to say no again.

He didn’t stop there. He kissed my neck without asking, kept his hand on my thigh, and then started sliding his hand up my dress.

19502,1i3zq70,post,"Plz, tell ds to him for I am nothing but a coward.","Dear Kerj,

I know it's been a while, and I'm starting to forget the way your jokes sounded. Do you have any new ones to make me laugh again? If I could immortalize them, I probably would—but I guess nothing lasts forever. I don’t know what to say at all, but I know what I feel deep down—I love you. I still do. No matter what I do, no matter how hard I try to forget you or even ignore you, I can’t—or perhaps I won’t. I am just too entangled in the idea of loving you. I guess that’s the only thing I know.

Why does it seem like every time I take a leap to forget you, you suddenly appear, out of nowhere, out of the blue? I’m not blaming you—not at all. You’re too precious to me, after all. I love you, and it seems like there’s nothing I can do to stop myself from wanting you. I’ve tried, I’ve tried so hard to control it, or even erase it if I could, but what can I do when the only beat my heart knows is you? What else could stop a heart from beating for something it’s fond of? Dying, I suppose. And even then, I’d still love you more—despite the separate worlds. My love for you runs through eternity.

I know that what you feel right now, upon reading this, might be shameful or even disgusting—or something like that. And I know that feeling because it’s what I feel writing this. I pity myself for letting someone do this to me, but I don’t regret a single word I’ve written here. They’re all true. I don’t even regret the moment I first felt the echo of my heart beating your name nonstop since the moment our stars aligned.

I used to ask God why He let me meet you—or let you meet me—if there’s no hope, not even the slightest glimmer, for us. Not even a thousand matches could light a spark between us to start something. Perhaps sometimes I feel that you’re too good for me, and I’m nothing but a dewdrop among the beautiful red carnations blooming in a summer yard.

But God answers me in ways I can’t always grasp. I know He does what’s best for me, and in every situation He puts me in, there’s always a way out. But I guess there’s no way to escape you. Even if I were handed a thousand keys to get out or even if the door was opened wide, I’d still choose to be imprisoned by you forever—even if it meant the folly and splendor of this world.

Have you ever imagined a love as great as this? As monstrous and inexplicable as the love I have for you? You might say I’m just hyped up or a lunatic, but trust me, I’m certain. And certainty is love, as love is certainty, so there’s no reason to doubt at all. I know you’ve known me all along, and the familiar feeling of knowing each other is perhaps the only thing keeping me alive.

You know I’d do anything for you—but not something that would suffocate you. So I ask you—I beg you—please, tell me what you feel about me. I don’t care what it may be, but at least tell me, so I can somehow know what it feels like to be loved by someone more than themselves. I want to know—even a single word would do.

Yours eternally,
Dens

Hopefully he does. and even more hopefully he learns a lesson don't be a cunt

19504,1i3x45r,post,So thing's have changed and I have been given an opportunity. ,"So yesterday I made a confession about not caring about using substances and someone overdosing. 

That was wrong and I received both love and hate. 

After my post, I decided to make a change. 
I'm still a user so this is difficult. 

I made a few calls and was given an opportunity to do real good. It's not spectacular or glamorous, but who cares.

I'm going back to work in my original field of working with at-risk first nation kids. Now, im not around the kids until I clean up and dry out, so no worries there. But I'll be heading into the bush to build outhouses for when they/we bring them out. We'll be doing a number of things, including fishing and survival. Which was something I excelled at before addiction stole my life.

I don't expect much. I'm scared that I may not be able to do this, considering how far I've fallen. Booze and drugs have ruled me for a longtime now. I don't know what life looks like without them. 

But I'm going to do my best and I'd just like to thank the few people on here that were a part of my decision.  

So thank you. I hope I can make even a small difference.

I was walking down the streets with my friend and found a debit card on a wall. As you can tell from the title I took the card and pocketed it. I let the card rot in my coat for a couple of days before I decided to finally take it out, originally I had plans to just snap it or take a picture and send it online. It's not like those are better options but are still things I could have done.

Instead, I decided to use the card and I only spent £30 using a fake name until there was insufficient funds. I also should mention that another one of my friends used the card so he spent maybe £5 of that £30. After we used the money we just laughed about and went home and there was no feeling of guilt.

The next day I realized that I committed a crime, quite stupid really, but I began to have a bad feeling about getting caught which has only grown more. Yet, I continued to joke around but the stress was getting to me so I confided in another person, who told me to cut up the card. So I did. The card was cut up into pieces except for the name and number which is still on my person. Maybe about 30 minutes later I confessed to another person, explaining that it’s totally fine and stuff. Later on, I found the person who I spent money with and made plans to burn the card in the afternoon. So we made plans and during the wait till the afternoon I confessed to another person, I’m really bad at this.

It was afternoon and I met with the person and we walked to a secret spot and set alight the broken pieces of card and walked away. I don’t know why I thought that would release my stress but it didn’t, so I walked away with the name in my pocket and a continuous feeling of stress chipping away at me.

I arrived home and acted as usual. I’ve been told I seem paranoid recently and I’ve been feeling sick due to my stress. I needed to write a full confession to ease my stress for now as I’ve misplaced the name part of the card. I would like to say thag i usually struggle to feel guilt towards things but worrying feeling that I’m going to get caught and the paranoia is very different from my usual demeanor. This has affected my behavior and relationships with me being very fidgety and acting as someone who drank a lot of caffeinated drinks would if you want to picture it. I’ve been using the name part of the card and rubbing it to calm down, and as I don’t have it right now I’m writing this.

If you’ve read this far, I’d like to thank you, and maybe you could help me figure out what exactly I’ve committed and ways to ease the stress and guilt.

It wasn't that great, and I didn't think he would realize that I faked it since he's never had.. you know..

Also the fact that I was an adult and Caleb was a few months shy of his 18th birthday. It still bothers me.. we were done after a year or so since he ended up cheating on me, but yeah.

Okay, so I looked it up. Both genders' age of consent in NH (where I'm from) is 16, so it's NOT RAPE. I got a few threats and messages about killing myself for being a rapist, but I'm really not.

Also, this was over 7 years ago, I'm 26 now, and I was always the good kid in my family's eyes.

Also the fact that I was an adult and Caleb was a few months shy of his 18th birthday. It still bothers me.. we were done after a year or so since he ended up cheating on me, but yeah.

Okay, so I looked it up. Both genders' age of consent in NH (where I'm from) is 16, so it's NOT RAPE. I got a few threats and messages about killing myself for being a rapist, but I'm really not. The main thing I was worried about is that I snuck out of the house to have sex with someone who had convinced me to and I wasn't sure how to deal with it. Also, this was over 7 years ago, I'm 26 now, and I was always the good kid in my family's eyes. It weighed on me that I could betray their trust like that just for a guy.",0,89.0,2025-01-17 16:25,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1i3k61y/when_i_was_19f_i_snuck_out_of_the_house_to_have/,Neutral
19511,1i3iper,post,There’s so much going on and I don’t know how to navigate it ,"There’s been a big cloud over my head for the past few months. It seems like ever since I started school this year things have snowballed and now everything is so dreary and I dread going outside. My cousin overdosed yesterday, I never got to know her well since she lives far but i’ve met her a good couple of times. My bestfriend since 7th grade is struggling with anorexia right now too. I know this really has nothing to do with me but watching her practically disintegrate in front of me is really disturbing. Yesterday I touched her wrist and it felt like one of those model skeletons from elementary science classes. Her mom has been contacting me to monitor what she’s doing at school. I can’t lie to myself that I don’t see her working out on the sidelines during practice or throwing away and mixing up food to look like she’s eaten.  My house is filled with whispers of all this depression and I talk about it with my mom and stuff but I just want it to all go away. I want my friend to get better because I know she’s sick but I can’t do anything because she won’t tell me. I don’t know what to do. I’ve been talking to her mom and she talked to the school so hopefully something happens and she begins to heal. If not we might need to intervene and then it’ll be a mess.

19512,1i3gvx2,post,I suffer from auto cannibalism and trichotillomania.,"Basically what the title says.

I cut chunks of my body on purpose to eat them, usually calluses on my feet, dry skin from my scalp for example or the skin stuck to hair I pull out (I have trichotillomania too). I don't specifically enjoy it and it gives me stomach aches but it's compulsive. 
Today I dug into my feet with sharp nail clippers (usually what I use to cut pieces of my skin) because I thought there was something trapped under my skin and ate all the skin I removed. Once I was done I laid down for some time and realized, this needs to be addressed really badly. 

Also, I don't eat anything else than my skin, never my hair or my nails or anything, just skin.
I'm using a throwaway account because I'm extremely ashamed and I sincerely don't know what to do with that. I have NEVER heard of anyone with autocannibalism (autosarcophagy) and at this point I don't really know what to do with myself. I'm already on some meds, including some for anxiety / OCD and it helps to some extent but this is getting out of hand.

Please let me know if you know someone with the same condition and feel free to ask questions if you have any.

EDIT: Everyone's support and comments encouraged me to try and talk about it so I told my best friend about it. It went well and we even joked about it a bit. :)","I suffer from auto cannibalism and trichotillomania. Basically what the title says.

19513,1i3gu8d,post,I can't tell them I can't be a monster but anyways.,"Hey , I won't say my name my age or either ways where I live I need advices I need some help.

When I used to be young I was quite confused , I had an aunt I didn't knew her name or either ways how she looked like. I used to live in another country but had to move to a country in Europe for education reasons. I had familly in there and well....They were weird. 

I met two twins (they are my cousins and both of them are girls.) They are nice , beautiful and their mom (which is my unknow aunt) seems like she died from an accident , to their prespective she had an accident and well that's how she died , that's what most of my cousins believes in.

One time when I was 12 in the car with my father and my mother we were chatting and stuff.....I don't know where it came to that point that it quickly changed into talking about familly stuff relatives.

And where it came to this unknow aunt my father started saying things like ""she was a good person.""  ""They ruined her."" My mother pinched him quickly and gave him a side eye glance that I was still here on the car with them.

At home I asked why father was like this my mother never  responded , brushing it off saying ""oh you know , you father is alyways like this he doesn't know what he's talking about."" 

It was really weird...like super weird when I asked about this ""unknow aunt"" they face changed they seemed uncomfortable.


When I became a teenager , 
One time while cleaning since we were living in an apartment and we had to move close to my grand-mother due of her being lonely. 
And since the apartment is almost going to get destroyed since it was there for a long time ago the government decided to destroy it to build some new houses.

My father was packing , and I on the other hand I was cleaning the cellar since we needed to get our stuff from there since we couldn't let them stay there so...I was cleaning and suddenly I found a tape there was nothing writting on it it was almost....something you couldn't recognize.

It seemed like it was there a long time ago , I picked it up and I shouldn't. I kept it not wanting to sound as a snitch to my father.

1 day before we had to move I secretly picked it up hid it the whole day from my parents and then put it on my TV (Sony brand really old.) At first it made those glitching sounds like it didn't seem to work I had lost hope a little.

And after , it worked a bit glitchy but better than nothing. I saw a house that seemed much like where my cousins lives (the twins) but of course different decorations where suddenly a woman came she sounded like she was on a bad mental state making herself seems like she's alright but it was clear she wasn't.

She started saying things , and then preparing a rope a chair , and she killed herself recording it the recording stayed until she was in loss of breath and after a door opened and a scream.

The video was quickly shut down.

At first I was shocked first of all why the fuck would my parents have this , and second of all who is this.

Then there was time where I was invited to go to my cousins house for their birthday party after that I went to their room just out of boredom of course I was with them and suddenly I saw on their desk some albums stuff.

That's when I saw a photo it looked exactly like the woman on the video , I asked them ""hey.....and..... who is this ?"" They responded by ""oh that's our mom."" And yeah I froze a little and I couldn't explain.

The woman was their mother was killed herself.

I demanded my parents some explanations and at the end they said that their mother used to be happy and things like that after because of familly problems she became more depressed and her Sister made her life a living hell , her state became more like a person who was unstable that don't know what to do in life she was lost.

In the morning they got a call from her husband , to announce that she was dead after the funeral the husband gave them the tape to keep it and to never use it or watch it but to not destroy it , the reason it was for the safety of the girls to not know the truth.

Now they are living a good life happy and they aged well with a mother (step mother.) Well I was growing in deep depression and blaming myself to not tell them , I am the only cousin who knows about it and I fell in deep guilt.

I hope I won't become like her to say the least and I hope she's in heaven.","I can't tell them I can't be a monster but anyways. Hey , I won't say my name my age or either ways where I live I need advices I need some help.

19514,1i3fmsj,post,A prisoner of unknown crimes wrestling with regret and isolation.,"Humans have an extraordinary ability to solve problems, maybe that's why we were given this blessed complex organ of neurological mass of cells. But even for this miraculous organ it is not possible to fight certain factors of the natural world, let alone comprehend or solve incomprehensible events. Various coping mechanisms, of which detachment comes to the point, was advocated to bring peace to our fragile mental consciousness. 

I am still fighting to understand detachment. I am still fighting to understand how to solve my problems. Of which regret will ever loom great, like an ever present shadow. I am not anxious about the eventual end of myself, maybe scared because of the hope that people all around us preach. But today my mind has given me one option: live whatever you life you have left, and upon the final act, if blessed by the beings which sent you here, if they exist, ask them this. What sins, what great immoral things could I have commited to deserve such great a punishment? Perhaps the beings will allow you to ask one question, for all the laughs and performances I staged for them in this life. Perhaps as the scrolls always portray, they might show mercy even to the greatest sinners.

I know whatever I feel, this isolation, this alienation, this crushing loneliness, cannot be solved anymore by my own efforts. I know I'm just another moving mass of flesh that has no significance, no relevance, in this grand indifferent order of the cosmos. This intense feeling of sorrow is just another futile effort by my foolish brain trying so very hard to come up with at least one solution to a problem that cannot be solved anymore. Just like a prisoner cannot escape a jail for the crimes committed, but in this case I am unaware of the crimes which beset me into this condition. For every day I pray, I ask for my transgressions, so that I may console my inner self, find peace in the knowledge that my suffering has meaning, serves some purpose. Be free from this tremendous convulsion of finding why am I being held captive. Yet here I remain, every night, bound, trapped and grasping in vain for an answer that never comes.

19517,1i3a69m,post,"If I don’t get a partner by age 30, I’m going to off myself","I made this suggestion to myself on my 26th birthday, which was two months ago. 

It’d be far too embarrassing to be that old without ever having someone to date. I’ve only had two events that could even be considered as a “date”. I once went to a movie with a girl that liked me, back in middle school. My parents chaperoned. And I went to prom with a girl I liked back in high school, as friends. Nothing ever happened with either girl. The first one because I had to move, and the second one because she just didn’t see me that way.

I tried in college to get a girlfriend. The only girl I was interested in was taken, and kept an on-off relationship with her boyfriend.

I wouldn’t mind being single at 30 if I had ANYTHING before. But no, I’m not going to live my life without ever having anyone. So if I get a girlfriend and we break up before then, then I’ll be fine. I won’t have been single my whole life. 

I’m taking steps to better myself. I’m going to go to therapy. I’m going to the gym and trying to be less fat. I’m even trying to swap to working weekdays so I have weekends off, on the off chance I can find a girl better that way. 

Other than being alone, my life is fine. I have a job, I pay my bills, I have hobbies. But I’m just not going to go through this life alone. I simply refuse.

I've also noticed they seem REALLY eager to give me a cervical exam. I feel so uncomfortable when they press for it. Three of them have done this now, saying they've gotten really good at it, like what?? If I wanted to do that I'd schedule with an OBGYN.

I'm just beside myself with the quality of care. It seems like in my small city, all I ever see are NPs who don't know what they're doing. Or if I'm lucky, an irritated burnt out MD who would rather let the NP deal with me.

The day we broke in an abandoned house .

This was during my teenage years.  Doing normal stuff, ya know thracking each other with thorns, shoplifting (and getting a free ride back home in a cops car), and breaking and entering in a abandoned house... You know normal stuff .

We ( Josh and I....ok friend, good for street hockey, but ok friend ) We would always ride our bikes pass this house to go to the playground, and the house sat on that spot for a long time.  Waiting for TLC and love that never came...and it showed 

Old and ratty house, mostly hunter green with shade of gray that used to be white. Beautiful stonework house as well, you can tell this used to be a proud home, but now it waits to be renovated...hopes to be renovated.

One day we were riding our bikes and saw the garage windows shattered, I jammed my breaks and walked towards the garage.

I could reach the lock.  And so I did, we only opened up the garage door a silent crack and we were in the garage.  First thing we saw was newspapers, sacks of them,  looks like Ambrose Monk sacks of newspaper.  In the middle of this pile was a pair of wire cutters.

Wire cutters,  nothing fancy, weighs a ton, has a plastic coating on (looks like dipped in plastic) no markings.  But you know what?  My mom still has them, and she's a huge crafter and it's been 30 years.  Still weirdly sharp

Ok.  Stairs, why not? So up we went.  Ok first floor.  Cool , and there is a closet.  So naturally we opened the closet and there was just coat hangers , I step back and look up on the shelf.  There was a half bottle of vodka, did we try it? No.. Ok.  We found the small bathroom. Toilet, Of course it's full of turds .  We went upstairs, we found a smashed up antique looking rotatory phone. 

We were having a blast exploring around , nothing much in the rooms.  But in the kitchen there was the house keys.  Ok.  It'll be cool to have a secret club here !  And we took them.  (We never had our secret club), and right connected to the kitchen was the back porch.

Ah, yes the back porch.  We would see this beautiful totally screened in porch every time we would ride our bikes ...it was beautiful . Huge wide screens supported by thin strip of woods so it would look almost invisible .  A work of art.

Now, we would enter this porch, it was tired,   Sightlines not so straight , mossy bits here and there, carpenter ants having a feast.  Walking over the dead bird.

It was a robin, male.  You could still see it's colors, still bright and bold,  and with it it's skeleton.  Starved to death.

It felt weird in there.  We stood up, I saw the old tired screens, huge as they were , had hundred of little bumps.  The bird flying hard as it can to get out.  We figured the wind must've blew the screen door open, blew the bird in, and latch itself shut. 

Poor bird.

So we left and that's how we broke into a abandoned house.","The day we broke into the old abandoned house. It was TLDR: broke in the house, found sharp wire cutters , half bottle vodka, busted phone ,keys and dead bird  left

19524,1i2m9xu,post,I have an uncle somewhere in England that i will never know ,"Throwaway acc but it also contains some stuff some people might find triggering 

When i was around the age of 11-13 (i don't exactly remember i've lost a lot of memories from my past.) i saw a Reddit post on YouTube about a guy who never got to meet his father who was a sailor and there only leed is that they sent a letter to this very specific country to this very specific island where he lived. I recognised that story because it was a story told to me by my grandma. She couldn't understand English so she took the Letter to a neighbour and the neighbour told her “it says something about a baby”
My grandma threw that letter and we never spoke of it again... But because i recognised that story i quickly made a Reddit account found the post and messaged the guy, he was around the age of my youngest uncle so the timeline matched and the story was lining up to what i was remembering. I proceed to ask him to foot the bill for a dna test and sadly mid way though the text my mom found out i was talking to someone... A stranger. I tried explaining the situation but i only got yelled at for hours i even sent a video of my mom yelling at me so he could believe me that his (probably) sister was not a fan of the idea. I ended up panicking saying i didn't want contact and i closed the conversation. He did make an update post calling the situation weird and deleted the post.

That day my mom proceeded to yell, scold, insult and many more thing for what felt like an eternity. It was late at night by the time she was done. The next day she proceeded to call all 6 of her siblings and all of them gave me an earful 
The following days one by one the siblings and thee spouses were coming  into our house and insulting me. I didn't have a room i was living in the living room so any time they looked over and they remembered i existed they would make a joke at my experience because they all got tired of yelling. Years later any time they remember it they make fun of me for sticking my nose where it doesn't belong and trying to destroy our family.

I haven't had an easy life

Trigger warning 

I'm almost 21 now and living with my grandparents because of severe mental health issues. 
I struggle with s.h and i can't fall asleep without a bottle of vodca and loud music on my headphones 

I was watching a documentary about a similar case and all the guilt and shame came back to bite me in the ass

I only had good intentions, now it just feels like i gave him false hope and made him more miserable. No matter what i said that there toxic and religious lunatics i think he would have liked to experience that himself. To get to know the island where he's from, to get to know his half sibling but because i was a coward i took that away from him

The guilt is eating me alive and I can't handle it
I need to tell someone 

I want to find him and properly apologise 

But i can't do anything 

I can't move from my room 
When i'm in a crowded place or with people i don't trust i get panick and anxiety attacks 
My grandparents can't trust me to be alone in my room for more than 3-4 hours and i'm falling apart

19525,1i2kch7,post,"I'm not a good person, but I am trying to be better and I just need to tell someone","Hello everyone

So, like the title says, I'm not a good person. I am trying, genuinely, to get better, but I keep falling into this idea that I need to be better now, right now, or I'm a failure.

I was abused for a majority of my childhood, and I suffered abuse and neglect my entire life from most of my caregivers (teachers). I'll be honest and say I did not come out of that a good person, I had a lot of underlying conditions like ADHD, OCD, GAD, MDD, a disassociative disorder and psychosis going on and I straight up do not have a healthy view of relationships and how to treat them thanks to years of constant psychological pressure, witnessing divorce, witnessing a LOT of fighting between my parents, and generally being niave enough to believe that romantic relationships are always in a honeymoon phase and all friendships are immediate and life-long connection with bonds so deep they beat the Mariana's Trench (thanks Disney).

The abuse I suffered turned me into an abuser, which is hard for me to admit sometimes. I was not a kind person to a lot of people, including my most recent ex. My ex reacted to my abuse with abuse, and it created this constant feedback loop of resentment and fear. I have been making attempts to get better, and I'm currently staying away from relationships until I know my outlook on people and having relationships is stronger and healthier. My last relationship imploded because I didn't say ""we need to be apart for me to get better"". 

I never laid my hands on anyone, but I was verbally and psychologically abusive, and I know first hand how horrible that is. I want to be better because I don't want to keep making other people suffer because I'm angry, sad and bitter over how my childhood was, over how I was treated. I don't want to keep hurting people because I'm selfish and want to be told that I'm good and kind and loving when I'm not. I don't want to hurt people because I have an ego as fragile as an egg shell and can't take it when people tell me that I'm doing something wrong. I don't want to keep hurting people because I'm convinced they'll leave me, so it's better I just explode it and prove myself right rather than react rationally. I don't want to keep hurting people. I just don't. I'm tired of screwing people's lives up because I'm not kind enough to step away and leave them be. I'm sick of always losing the people I love because I can't be vulnerable, because I can't open up and allow people to get closer to me rather than keeping them at arm's length and pretending everything is hunky dory; because deep down, I convinced myself they will leave me regardless, because I'm not perfect and I never will be. 

I am trying to get better. I'm on medication that genuinely helps, I see a psychiatrist and a psychologist regularly, I went to a mental hospital when I realized I didn't want to live anymore and that my hallucinations were getting stronger and it was getting harder for me to tell them from reality. I am trying, but I keep falling into the same cycle of being afraid to fail, of being afraid to be less than perfect. I have all my tools, but I am afraid to lose them or break them, so I don't use them. 

I keep telling myself over and over again that it will be okay, and that it's okay to fall down and scrape your knee. It's okay to be depressed sometimes, it's okay to have episodes, just as long as I come out of it okay again. I believe it, genuinely, but I keep falling for the same lie that I need to be perfect, that I can't be a failure, over and over again. I just want to be able to tell someone this without it being my therapist, I want to be able to feel like I'm being heard without feeling like I don't deserve to be heard because I keep screwing shit up. 

I wish I had done things differently. I wish that I took my self-awareness and actually did something with it instead of just having it. But I can't change the past, or the relationships I've ruined, and the only way I can keep moving is forward.

Thanks for reading, apologies if this was a long one. I know this comes off as a boatload of self-pity, because it is. I just needed to feel pity for myself for a moment and tell someone about it, so again, thank you for reading. It means a lot.

19527,1i2clmq,post,I fell off the treadmill at the gym today and I’m mortified ,"I fell off the treadmill at the gym today. I’ve only been to the gym about ten times in the last two months. I’m trying to get back in shape after having a baby. I tried to hit a pr (not super fast by any means. My fastest mile is 11:02) and I started to feel like I was going to have an asthma attack so as soon as I hit a mile I pressed the stop button and it didn’t slow down fast enough so I tried to go to the side and I slipped BUT caught myself. Then my air pod fell out and I bent to grab it and slipped again and fell all the way down. The girl next to me had to ask if I was okay. I think that made it more embarrassing. The worst part is that at my gym you have to clean the equipment when you’re done so I had to walk in front of everyone again. I started to cry and that made my asthma feeling worse so I left the gym and cried in the car.

I’ve only been to the gym about ten times in the last two months. I’m trying to get back in shape after having a baby. I tried to hit a pr (not super fast by any means. My fastest mile is 11:02) and I started to feel like I was going to have an asthma attack so as soon as I hit a mile I pressed the stop button and it didn’t slow down fast enough so I tried to go to the side and I slipped BUT caught myself. Then my air pod fell out and I bent to grab it and slipped again and fell all the way down. The girl next to me had to ask if I was okay. I think that made it more embarrassing. The worst part is that at my gym you have to clean the equipment when you’re done so I had to walk in front of everyone again. I started to cry and that made my asthma feeling worse so I left the gym and cried in the car.

He considers me a good worker and also says that i have been managing the people well but i heard from someone in the company that he is not willing to change my role to manager band since the even higher management may ask him questions.

19532,1i1rklx,post,My friends took my car and end up having my first threesome.,"Ok so I am 28 and this happened when I was like 20 or 21. It was a Friday and I was about to get off of work. I had been talking to my friends and were planning on going out to a house party that night. It was my turn to drive or be the DD. So we all got dressed at my place and of course we were all dressed like sluts 😝 and we left for the party.

This was a house party and we had other friends there but we didn't know who's house it was. Either way we were there to party, drink, and have fun. So once we arrived we grabbed some drinks and found a spot so we can scope out the people there. My best friend has always been the crazy one decided to go talk to some guy she thought was cute. I stayed with the other two girls then my best friend comes back and grabs my hand and pulls me to the guy she was talking to.

He was there with his friends as well and my friend introduces me to another guy which was also very cute. We start hanging out with them and having drinks, then we go and dance and I notice that my friend disappeared and my other two friends are no where to be seen. So all of a sudden I feel like I'm all by myself and don't know anyone but this guy that I met there. So I grab him by the hand and tell him that he needs to help me find my friends. 

We both walk all over the house looking for the girls but we didn't find them. I go and grab my purse and notice that my keys are gone so we go outside and sure enough my car is also gone! I asked the guy what time it was and he said 1am! I was shocked that it was so late and he tells me that I have been drinking a lot. We go back in and find his friends and one of them tells me that my friends were looking for me but that I was dancing and drinking too much so they decided to take my car home. 

Luckily I did find my best friend and she was still with the same guy that we met. We stayed about another hour and had a few more drinks and we both decided it's time to go but we no longer have a ride back home. We decided to ask the guys we were with if they would give us a ride and of course he agreed. 

On the way back home I was sitting in the back and my friend in the front with the guy she met driving and they were still talking and flirting while I sat quiet. 
Next thing I notice was her disappearing and some noises coming from the front. I scoot up and look over the seat and see her giving the guy a bj. I was shocked but not surprised because she has always been the daring one! I tell her "" you better not make him crash!"" And she gets up and looks at me and tells him to pull over! 

After he pulled over I see her take her top off and continue with the bj and I was just like omg! Once again I comment "" damn you really couldn't wait until after you dropped me off?"" And again she gets up and says ""shut up you know you like watching"" well she was right. He leaned his chair back to give her more room, and watching her working him and seeing her boobs out just made me horney so I moved closer to get a better look. I don't know if he noticed me enjoying the view or what but he reached over and grabbed my hand put it on his cock while she was sucking him. Right away i notice that he has a big dick at least the biggest one that i have ever touched. Then he put his arm around my back and pulled me closer. 

At this point I was really horney and I feel him pulling my shirt up and I stop and pull back. My friend then stops and looks at me and asks what's wrong and right away tells me to take my shirt off and proceeds to help me. Now we both are topless, she goes back to sucking on him and he then starts touching my boobs so I just lean over and start kissing him. They both decide to make their way to the back seat and get undressed so I decided to also suck on him a little while my friend makes out with him. His cock was already really hard and wet from my friend sucking on him and it just slid right in my mouth. Next thing I know his dick was hitting the back of my throat and I gag instantly! 

My first thought was shit he really does have a big dick! As I sucked on him my friend takes the rest of my clothes off and she then jumps on him and starts to ride him! I'm sitting there next to them so I get up and stick my boobs in his face and he starts sucking my nipples. After a little while my friend gets off of him and tells me ""your turn"" so I said why not but this time the guy gets up and tells me to turn around and he put it in me from behind. He put it in really slow and I remember it going in slowly and it just kept going in and I was like oh damn it's still going in! Then he hits something inside and it hurt so I pulled away and he stopped. I took a couple breathes and thought , well he is already in me so let's see what he can do, so I scooted back and pushed him the rest of the way in. 

He started to fuck me really hard and there I was just bent over in the back seat of the car bitting my lip trying not to yell from the pain but it felt good too! After like 2 min of him fucking me I hear him moan and he pulls out and my best friend jumps right in and starts sucking him. He lets out these loud moans and finishes in her mouth. We put our clothes back on and he takes us the rest of the way home.

19533,1i1njlo,post,I had a breakthrough in Therapy today & no one to share it with...,"TW: CSA & DV/SA mentioned. 

I'm mostly on Reddit as a lurker so have never posted & don't really know how to, so please bare with me. Not sure if this is right sub but I just gotta share this SOMEWHERE

I've (32F) been in Therapy on/off over the last 15+ years to get support for CSA as well as DV abuse that occurred from late teens to mid 20s. If I'm being honest, I'd never completely engaged or committed to these sessions as I'd felt I was fine & didn't need to revisit the past. 

4 yrs ago though I met my fiance (37m) whose honestly just so amazing. I decided after meeting him that I would work hard to be my best self - no more leaning on CSA or DV as an excuse for toxic behaviours or habits I hadn't unlearned yet, no more being a doormat or being so strong that there's no room for compromise; essentially just no more 'hurt people, hurt people' behaviour. We also decided that we wanted to try start a family (both have fertility issues).

Because of all this, I decided to get back into therapy & truly commit to ensure I could be the partner my fiance deserves, the person I deserve & dream of being, and to be a better mother to my future child than my own was/tried to be. 

I've been in Therapy for almost a year now & it's been amazing. I've learned to communicate so much more clearly and coherently, I no longer shrink from confrontation or if there's a difference in opinion. I've learnt to communicate & stay firm about what I need, want etc. Overall, I now have more self confidence, understanding of my trauma & physical/mental reactions, and my relationship is thriving.

Yesterday during my therapy session we were 'processing' a pretty tough memory of CSA, and the thought or cognition we're trying to dispel is ""I am tainted"".

While we were processing this, I had a revelation: our skin cells completely regenerate every 7-10 years, and daily we lose close to 500 million skin cells everyday. I realised that the skin (and skin cells) that was violated (or tainted) is gone.

Poof. Just like that - they're gone. 

And so too is the thought that I'm tainted. 

The body my fiance has touched is not the same one that was violated repeatedly over the years. 

The body that my fiance has touched has not been mistreated or abused 

The body that my fiance has touched is completely different, it's not tainted. It's not me. 

The body that my fiance has touched is loving, caring, kind, empathetic. It no longer shakes or seeks shelter when a man raises his hand or voice.

This body won't bow or bend to manipulatation, abuse, or mistreatment. 
This body is fill of love, light & happiness. 

This body is NOT tainted, and nothing for me to feel ashamed about, or trapped in. 

This body is my own. I have control over it. I say who can/can't touch me. I say who I'll allow in my presence. I am in control & only I can sail this ship. 

And aside from my fiance, I have no one else to share these profound feelings of relief and achievement. 

So I hope someone on Reddit can quietly celebrate this milestone with me. I'm not tainted, I'm not worthless. I am me. And I am now Free.

19535,1i1e34r,post,I stole a dead person's bass guitar that was donated to a thrift store I used to work at and sold it a week later.,"I used to work at a thrift store. It was one of the larger ones, but not quite the big one. I also played music on the side and my instrument of choice was bass, so there's your backstory.

A lady brought in a bass guitar and case to donate one day. She donated to me through the donation are and she told me the story of how it belonged to her son who had recently died by suicide. She didn't know anything about it or really what to do with it but wanted it to go to someone who would play it and maybe they'd find it in the store. 

All of my coworkers who were at my level and a two of the keyholders immediately took notice of what we would honestly consider a ""premium item"" at the store and would bring it up in talks with me, saying I should buy it. The assistant manager, an older man but exceptionally easy to get along with, put it out for $300 in the second premium area of the store (there were two, one was mostly for jewelry and bags, the other for electronics, this ended up in the electronics area).

The next day, I was working with one of the keyholders and a couple other employees at my level. The keyholder straight up said ""you should take that bass home with you."" Implying I should steal it. The store had several blind spots for cameras, and to their own fault they did not have any cameras pointed towards the second premium area. 

After working a little bit and pondering on it, I thought ""screw it"" and called my dad and told him ""hey I'm buying a bass guitar that came in here, would you be able to come pick it up so it doesn't get picked up by anyone else?"" and he made his way out, I took the bass out of the premium area and out the side freight door, and put it in his truck. Clean getaway.

The next day I was working, and the assistant manager was already working when I showed up. About 5 seconds after I clocked in he came up to me and asked me ""hey, what happened with that bass guitar yesterday?"" Trying to play it cool, but in hindsight I wasn't really cool at all about it, I said, ""oh, some guy came in and bought it last night."" He gave me a ""hmm. Alright good deal.""

I was about certain he'd go and check the tills and see that no items for the sale price went out the door that night and although there are blind spots in the store, any amount of investigative work would have had me caught. My theory is that he absolutely knew I stole it, but he didn't pursue anything regarding it because just about everyone working there was on the edge of being destitute to begin with and losing me as an employee was just going to create a bunch of work for everyone else and himself.

After bringing the bass home and trying it out a bit, it became clear after about 30 seconds that it was a piece of crap. The electronics barely worked and were cheap and terrible sounding and it was an absolute burden to play workmanship wise. I sold it on craigslist after a week for $100. ","I stole a dead person's bass guitar that was donated to a thrift store I used to work at and sold it a week later. I used to work at a thrift store. It was one of the larger ones, but not quite the big one. I also played music on the side and my instrument of choice was bass, so there's your backstory.

19536,1i10fyx,post,I once rolled a pube Doob for someone and watched them smoke it,"M(28) when I was 16 I did something terrible that has been on my chest, I notice I think about it a lot. I lived in an unstable family growing up, so I left when I was 16 and moved into my friend (m17 at the time) who lived in his own apartment due to living in an unstable family as well.

My buddy would bring some of his own friends over to hit smoke seshes, and some of the friends where my friends as well. There was this one guy who always clueless to a behavior and in many ways we bullied him in a way that didn't seem like it was bullying, but it definitely was, he was just to clueless to realize it. We will call this guy Tom

So one time all 6 of us excluding Tom where hitting a sesh, and Tom asked to come chill so we said yes. Before he got to our place, my one buddy suggested we all go into the bathroom and shave some of our pubes and roll it into a joint. Everyone agreed. I however was against it but didn't say anything because I want to fit in and not be unaccepted by my group. So we all go into the washroom one after eachother and clipped our pubes and rolled it into a joint.

When Tom got to the place we told him we rolled him a fat one with a new type of weed called Australian from down under kush. Tom then lit the joint and started smoking it, it instantly smelled like burning hair for the entire time he smoked it. He asked all 6 of us if we wanted a hit from it and every one said no. He smoked it till it was a roach.

I wanted to tell him to put it out but I was young and stupid and didn't wanna ruin it in front of everyone. No one has told him to this day. So I'm here asking if it would be good to tell him or let it be since it's been 12 years.

Edit: we also video recorded it and I still have the video","I once rolled a pube Doob for someone and watched them smoke it M(28) when I was 16 I did something terrible that has been on my chest, I notice I think about it a lot.

I grew up in a suburban area of California that was mostly Asian.  70-80% of the kids at school were Asian, the rest were either White or Hispanic.

19541,1i0j2k0,post,That Time Two Twin Brothers Fell for Me… Without Knowing About Each Other,"Alright, let me take you back—way, way back, I’m talking 30 years ago. I was 16 years old, just a regular high school student. Every Friday morning, without fail, I’d find a single red rose on my desk. No note, no name, no clue who it was from. At first, I thought it was some kind of mistake, but week after week, there it was—a fresh red rose 🌹.

Not long after, the mystery deepened. Along with the roses, I started receiving love letters. These weren’t just your average notes; they were sweet, heartfelt, and incredibly personal. Yet again, no signature, no hints, nothing to give away who was sending them. I was baffled, but also secretly thrilled. Who wouldn’t be? It felt like something straight out of a romance movie.

Then, one day, the mystery of the roses was solved. One of the twin brothers in my class approached me, visibly nervous, and blurted out his confession. “I can’t keep it a secret anymore,” he said. “I’ve been leaving you the roses because I love you. Do you love me back?” My heart raced, and I could barely process his words. Before I could even respond, he looked at me with hopeful eyes, waiting for an answer. Oops 😅.

But wait—it gets better. The very next day, his twin brother approached me, just as anxious as the first, and confessed, “I’ve been sending you the love letters because I love you. Do you love me back?” Oops again 😬.

Here’s the kicker: neither of them had any idea what the other was doing. One twin was leaving roses; the other was writing letters, both pouring their hearts out to me without realizing they were stepping on each other’s toes. Talk about awkward!

So, there I was, caught between two brothers, each professing their love in their own way, yet completely unaware of the other’s actions. Oh, the drama! Needless to say, it was a moment I’ll never forget. End of story—or maybe just the beginning of a very complicated chapter!","That Time Two Twin Brothers Fell for Me… Without Knowing About Each Other Alright, let me take you back—way, way back, I’m talking 30 years ago.

19542,1i0gpmo,post,I would “use” boys when I was younger not realizing what I was doing.,"It probably really started when I was in 9th grade (over 25 years ago)
I would notice if a male liked me, and usually if they did they would go out of their way and do nice things for me. 




I wasn’t a flirt, I was not slutty, I did not dress too revealing (sometimes would be extreme baggy clothes and sometimes form fitting outfits), I was friendly and I thought I was treating everyone nicely - but looking back some of these things were not exactly nice of me- because most of these people wanted more from me than I realized at the time. 




I had a friend who got a pager for his bday one year, I didn’t have a pager yet, so I told him I was jealous and he basically gave it to me for a few months until I got my own, I also would not return his pages when he would page me on the pager that was his. 




A classmate who worked at the movie theatre had a crush on me and I would go to the theatre with a friend (boy or girl didn’t matter) and i would ask him for free passes- he would give them to me but I didn’t  talk to him any other time. 




An older guy I met at a job I had, he was probably 19 at the time, I was 16- I went to an Aerosmith concert and he was working security and I asked him to help me meet Aerosmith and he gave me his backstage pass so I could go and meet them. He gave me his number and I never called him. 




A person worked at a local sex shop, he would come into a coffee shop I worked at and would flirt with me, I didn’t have any interest and he knew I had a bf, he invite me to his store for free shopping sprees - I would go in and get outfits and random things. I only spoke with him while I was working and when he finally realized there was nothing going to happen he started to date a coworker and my freebies were cut off lol




If I was ever offered a ride home by a male I always took it, no matter how creeped out I felt, I just didn’t want to take the bus. Nothing bad ever happened, but many times at school or work, if there was any interest shown in me and they had a car, I was very nice to them. But would always have them drop me off a couple blocks from home so they never knew exactly where I lived. 




Someone who would flirt with me at the coffee shop worked at Sam Goodie so I had endless free CDs back then, in exchange I would give them a free drink tho. 




I worked at the Mall of America at a kiosk, so many people would walk by and I would always have people flirting, but one guy would try and try to talk to me and I wasn’t interested. But we would have just normal convos. I told him after work I was going to go buy some shirts from PacSun and this guy would almost daily go around the mall and boost clothes for me, I didn’t realize he was stealing until mall security stopped him and he was arrested. 




There is so many other situations like this that the list is too long. 
I don’t remember most these people’s names but I sure hope they didn’t grow up to be door mats for women, because they kinda were to me at a young age and it wasn’t right how I treated them in the end, I mean like I said I was always nice to them but I was also using them and I have grown to realize that and it wasn’t cool.

19543,1i0gc4i,post,I have literally no idea how to be a sober adult. ,"This is gonna sound incredibly stupid to a lot of people, I know.

I just turned 29 in November. I own my own home, have a decent paying job, I've never drank, and have never done hard drugs a day in my life. But I have smoked weed or consumed some form of THC or another since I was 14 or 15 years old nearly every day.

It used to be a weekend thing when I was in high school and then progressed to become an every day after school thing. When I graduated and moved out into my own place, it became an all day every day thing and has more or less been that way for the entirety of my 20s. I wake up, smoke, go to work, smoke at work, and then go home to smoke some more.

What's scary is that nobody knows any different. I'm high so much, nobody around me even knows the difference. I'm completely functional, communicate well and perform my job well which includes accounting and supervising a staff of 20+ people within my company, so its impossible for them to tell the difference. Nobody in my personal life has ever known me any other way but high either because its so normal. If I can't smoke flower, I smoke carts. If I can't smoke carts, I eat edibles. No matter what the situation is I have a way to get high all day every day without anyone even really knowing.

Turning 30 in less than a year has my head going over all of the decisions, good and bad, that I've made over the years and I'm realizing more and more that I don't want to live my life high like this anymore. The problem is that over the past 2 months of me trying to quit, I go maybe half a day at most before getting high is the only thing on my mind and I can't think about doing anything else until that happens. It's infuriating. I've been an extremely heavy daily smoker for 12 or 13 years meaning I have never been a sober adult. I've never lived on my own, worked, started my family or done anything life has to offer while sober. I want to quit but don't know how much damage has been done or how I'm going to completely cut out this crutch that has been there since I was a teenager.","I have literally no idea how to be a sober adult.

I'm completely functional, communicate well and perform my job well which includes accounting and supervising a staff of 20+ people within my company, so its impossible for them to tell the difference. Nobody in my personal life has ever known me any other way but high either because its so normal. If I can't smoke flower, I smoke carts. If I can't smoke carts, I eat edibles. No matter what the situation is I have a way to get high all day every day without anyone even really knowing.

Turning 30 in less than a year has my head going over all of the decisions, good and bad, that I've made over the years and I'm realizing more and more that I don't want to live my life high like this anymore. The problem is that over the past 2 months of me trying to quit, I go maybe half a day at most before getting high is the only thing on my mind and I can't think about doing anything else until that happens. It's infuriating. I've been an extremely heavy daily smoker for 12 or 13 years meaning I have never been a sober adult. I've never lived on my own, worked, started my family or done anything life has to offer while sober. I want to quit but don't know how much damage has been done or how I'm going to completely cut out this crutch that has been there since I was a teenager.",342,310.0,2025-01-13 15:22,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1i0gc4i/i_have_literally_no_idea_how_to_be_a_sober_adult/,Neutral

19545,1i08ic3,post,I have a very high sense of importance and I would kms if it meant people knew me. If even only for a second,"I want to be the name on everyone’s lips, the person people can’t stop thinking about. Talking about. Looking up on Google search. I want to be the reason conversations spark, the face that turns heads, somebodys celebrity crush that they dont shut up about. I want to walk into a room and feel the shift, the quiet gaze of recognition that I’m someone who matters, someone unforgettable. Somebody important. I crave the spotlight—not for vanity, but because it feels like proof that I exist in a way that’s undeniable.
To be invisible, overlooked, or forgotten feels like the worst fate imaginable. I want to leave behind something that lingers, a trace of myself in the minds of everyone I meet and everyone I don't. I need to be seen, heard, remembered—because if I’m not, then what’s the point of any of it?

And I hate admitting that. It sounds so arrogant, right? Like I’m just this self-absorbed, egotistical jerk who thinks the world revolves around them. But it’s not like that. Not really. 
I'm at least competent enough to know my place.

Though It’s not just online, either. In real life, I’ll catch myself doing things just to get a reaction. Laughing a little louder, dressing a little flashier, throwing out these big opinions in conversations just so people notice me. And when they don’t?
Well... I try not to think about it. 

I know it’s not fair to expect people to feed my ego like that. I know it’s not their job to validate me. I just... I don’t know how to stop needing it.

Some people are addicted to drugs,
Some people are addicted to alcohol, 
Some people are addicted to intimate experiences

Me? My drug is attention. 

Don't get me wrong, it's not like I think I’m better than everyone else. I have a lot of respect for those around me. I try to stay humble about it, at least. 
I wish I could turn it off. Just... stop caring so much about what people think. But every time I try, it’s like this itch I can’t scratch. I don’t know. Maybe admitting it is a start? maybe it’s not always going to be like this.
Maybe I'll seek therapy so I can at least talk about myself in a setting that's socially acceptable 

I just want to feel okay with being me. Even if nobody’s watching.

But maybe I want others to know about that too. ","I have a very high sense of importance and I would kms if it meant people knew me.

I ended up hanging with all these people going to bars with them doing drugs with then, partying, living with, cheated on him with .... and they had no idea I was absolute jail bait.

Years ago i came across a survivor immunity challenge on youtube and i was hooked, that led into me binging the challenges as i thought they were the coolest thing ever. Then it led to me watching youtubers like Peridiam and Once Upon an Island and i watched so many videos on each season, i even watched a video that went through every survivor winner up until season 40 because i thought that i would never be able to watch them. Fast forward to a year ago when we still had cable and we were flicking through the channels until i spotted survivor, i was so happy that it was on TV and it became our tradition that every wednesday at 7 we would watch it. Eventually though, we chose to stop having cable as it was eating up our bills and quite frankly no one was using it other than me and my mom on wednesday. But we found it on Amazon prime and we were so happy and started watching the earlier seasons. i couldnt have the heart to tell her that i know every winner because it would ruin it for her, she even asks me if i have “seen this season before” and i have to say i havent, which is true, i only know the winners and have forgotten most of the winners for the individual immunity challenges. i secretly try and make her like the winner throughout the episodes so she is happy when they win (it doesn’t work all the time though) this is the main thing i do to bond with my mom and it would kill her to know that i know who wins. I love my mom to death and i feel like a mother who is telling their kid that santa is still real to keep the “magic” alive. i’ll be off to university soon and i want to cherish these moments as much as i can :)

For context, we’ve known each other since we were 15 and are now 22. He always had a crush on me, but we stayed friends because I genuinely liked him as a friend. We lost contact from 18-20 but reconnected at 21. Over the past year, we texted, FaceTimed, and hung out a lot.

In September, he randomly blocked me for two months. He later apologized, saying he thought I hated him after lying about being a virgin. I forgave him because I’m a forgiving person.

Fast forward to Thanksgiving, he asked me to come over to try desserts I made. While I expected kissing, things escalated beyond my comfort. He ignored my repeated “no’s” and proceeded to finger me against my will, despite me saying stop and that it was painful. I screamed “OW” and he finally stopped, only because his family was home.

Afterward, I went to the bathroom and noticed I was bleeding. I felt very violated and shocked.","My friend assaulted me and now I’m not doing well at all I feel so empty. I was sexually assaulted in November, and I haven’t been okay mentally since.

19556,1hzj5su,post,I'm living with constant depresión and have regrets ,"Living with constant depresión 

My story starts 6 years ago, I was dating a woman who loved me very much after about 10 months of relationship we got into a fight one night and I decided to email my ex ( we had dated between 2012 to 2017 had been best friends since high-school, and had not talked in two years)  she did not reply right away but did so about 2 months later.

I kept my previous relationship going meanwhile. After I finally received an email back and started talking to my ex again I told. My girlfriend that we needed to break up because I wanted to see my ex, I know I was very scummy  but I was honest and direct. 

We did. Not Talk for about two months while i started to go out with my ex again it was extremely on a just as friends basis, no flirting or anything very little personal contact. 

Two months later I get a call from the gf I had broken up with and she told me she was pregnant and wanted to know if I wanted to have it with her and start a family ( we had talked about it during our relationship and we never used protection, I has always wanted to be a dad and I knew she was a phenomenal mom already, she had two kids from her previous marriage)

I let her know that at this point that would be a terrible idea. We went back and fourth and she decided to have an abortion. I was the one who actually got her the medication and gave it to her, she asked. Me one more time about keeping the baby and I said no so she went through with it. 

Skip to the end of the year me and my ex are now. Officially dating again the day we get back together we have amazing sex, the morning after we do too. Then our sexlife slowed down alot. 

She was having migraine episodes almost daily it got to the point where she needed medical help x her neurologist prescribed some medications that would help the migraine but in turn her sex drive dropped to 0.
 We spent the next year without having sex at all. 

She would also not interact sexually with me, I thought this was OK, I loved her more than anything so I could go without sex for a bit more. At the one year and a half mark I popped the question and asked her to marry me. 

The following year we had only had sex one time I was very happy because we had ""progress"" but it was starting to take its toll on me, I was about 30 pounds up. 
The wedding passed and during our honeymoon she did not want to have sex with me, I was very frustrated with this but I kept thinking this will get better. 

We had a talk later about that and I let her know how I was feeling, she said that at this point in her life it was not her priority to have sex with me, she did not care that we weren't able to, and if all I wanted from a partner was that, I should have hired a sex worker and not gotten married. 
The depression on my end let getting worse. I was now about 50 ish pounds heavier.

The next year she started to have very heavy periods and very painful ones. She went to the gy for the first time in her life (32 at this point) and found out from an intravaginal ultrasound that she had a huge myoma in her uterus that was causing her the problems. 

We faced several different expensive treatment options because of the size of the myoma her gyn suggested we try to get pregnant before any surgery because of the possibility of needing to remove the uterus. 

Although she agreed, her idea of trying to get pregnant was to have sex one time per month for three months, after failing to get pregnant we decided for the surgery. 

Everything went OK but our sex life is still at 0.
 I am now at 130 pounds over my lowest weight and I am constantly depressed.

She now says she doesn't want to get pregnant at this point because I'm Not fit enough to be a father. We have constant fights about the house shores, and the last time I made an attempt to have intimacy with her she made a very mean joke( I told her that she could be my dessert for the day, she asked what would she eat, I told her that I could be her dessert, and she said that she would need to find a vessel Big enough to chop me up and put me there to make tamales out of me later.) 

I live with contasnt depression, I feel unloved Un appreciate it, I now weight 352 pounds and I feel extremely unattractive and I no longer k ow what to do we are going monthly to couples therapy but she is always saying she does not know If she wants to continue the marriage because I keep failing to meet her expectations regarding the house chores, meanwhile she never goes trough with the intimacy goals we set during therapy. We barely kiss, never make out and now we have gone another 7 months without sex. 

I regret having asked my gf to have the aborting and not marrying her instead 

I am sorry for the long story and sorry if at any point it looks convoluted. I took me out of courage to write this ","I'm living with constant depresión and have regrets  Living with constant depresión

My heart is drooling tears and secreting the blood of my wasteful dreams. Another stab to my heart again, changing the fabric of my seams. Never clean, never filtered, always tainted with wishes of happiness. The happiness I can’t have, but thinking again and again I was never filled with blissfulness. Only the phantom of a heart. Aww this was perfect, kind and a thoughtful soul, but never would I have thought this would befall me. How wasteful this was, how disgusting…how could I ever have been lured.

My mind is distorted, my heart is disturbed, screeching is the cry of the child, Facing the world’s treacherous temptation of love. I still feel the light of love, the ember never died it only got stronger from every wind gust, just hope it doesn’t burn me in the end and lead my heart to unravel its troubled seams. 

I hope I see you again in a different world, a different timeline, hopefully you feel the same way inside your heart again. I’ll just kill time waiting for the realization, hope we can find that spark of love again, no matter how harmed and scorched our bodies will be I can’t wait for the time again. Brand new, new source, new music, new senses ready to be felt again. Won’t be alone, no more sickness, no more sorrow, no more dread again. Hope to see you happy, no more doubt, no more self hate, we can just love again.

I’m so stupid we’re Back in this loop of the adorned hope that we can love again.  It’s like that dream that shut us out before the ending, so frustrated, the feeling is so indescribable.

19558,1hzfo8y,post,"So, there is a possiblity that I fathered a chiled with a lady of the night","So, a bit of backstory, in 2014 I started working in a motel, and stumbled across a website that no longer exists where people sold their time for money all because a phrase my coworker described herself as. I saw a pic of an attractive woman completely not related to the phrase I searched, saw what she was offereing and with nervousness and excitment contacted her and took her up on her services amd enjoyed it. While working at the motel one guest completely enamored me and I wanted to ask her out and her coming down to the lobby in a wet t-shirt and see through stockings with a thong on really pushed the idea. Although, she wasn't arrested with the two guys she shared a room with by the fbi she coudn't afford to pay for the room, so,  she checked out before my shift and I thought I'd never see her again. Come 2016 I'm back in school and while i'm in school I stick to a no relationships rule because I needed to focus on my classes and get passing grades. However. when the carnal need hits, just use that site I found. One day I did just that and I didnt believe my eyes  when I saw the girl from the hotel in an ad. So, I most definitely called her and It was amazing, I became a regular of hers and told her how I was in awe of here when I first saw her at the motel. Unfortunately, she of course didn't remember me but I kept seeing her frequent enough throughout the year. Then one day I go to the site and see she didn't post , day's go by and no post, weeks go by and still no post. I contact the girl she would post  2 for 1 specials with and she told me to forget about her and if I want to see her she's available. I didn't take her up on her offer and it was a bit bummed. August of 2017 out of boredem I check the site, and I see her post that she is back, I hit her up immediately and when I show up she actually remembers me (this is where it starts where I didn't make the best decisions here) after a bit of foreplay she tells me she doesn't have a condom and asks if i'm clean I say yeah she says she is too and that we could do it without protection. We are in a living room and she is bent over doggy style I was hesistating but when I felt how wet she was I stuck it in and was going to pound town, when someone walks in on us. We went to the bathroom to try to continue with oral but the moment was gone, I thanked her and left.  Not feeling satisfied I check to see if she posted days later, she did, we meet up she says she is in a hotel now so we don't have to worry about people barging in on us. We do foreplay and to my surprise again she asks if i'm still clean and I say yes. From this point on we  just stopped using protection, Not only that but after the next visit afterI was no longer paying to see her. She called it an exchange I'd give her rides to random places like the phone store or grocery shopping and she'd see me for free. I remember one day im February 2018 she called when I was class and left a message saying call her when I get a chance, I was like this isn't normal behavior for her, then I was like she's pregnant why else would she leave that message, but  when I called her she just wanted to know if I planned on meeting up with her later because she might have plans. Her plans cancelled and I saw her that evening. So, its now Valentines day and she actually text's me a really sweet message wishing me a happy valentines and to call her when I'm done with classes for the day to get together. Howerver, when I did, I got no response, messaged her the following day, no response, I call the rest of the week and there is no response, and after a while I gave up on her. Then I graduate that May and start dating my current S/O we are about to have out 3rd kid together. Then one day on FB I come across a friend suggestion, while i'm looking through the friendslist to see if we know anyone in common I come across her page ( I knew her actual name by this point) and I creep on it and I see she has a kid, snooped more on her page and saw she had the kid in Nov of 2018 which is about 8 months before I had kids. Now, I would chalk this up as a coincidence because she was just seeing me for free but others still had to pay, but her kid is mixed I'm black and she's white and everything lines up putting me in the window of conception.

19561,1hzb6my,post,I regret hating my disabled older brother after he passed,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

So for context my older brother was disabled, he couldn’t drive/read/write and he has the brain age of a 6 year old at 33. When I was younger he would abuse me, physically, verbally and had consistently attempted to rape me. I was told to keep quiet about these instances because my parents didn’t want to look irresponsible, I understand that is their fault. But I think they’ve raised a monster, whenever my brother got the chance (which was almost everyday)  he’d spit, kick or hit me fully knowing that it’s harmful to me (he’s bigger and stronger than me), i had tried to talk him through this but since my parents have told me he can’t help himself or it’s his condition causing these issues. I’ve occasionally caught him trying to watch me shower too which is another thing he had done in harassing me. He’d constantly turn my mother against me, blaming me for things I didn’t do. I wanted him to disappear in anyway possible.

Last year I had mopped the stairs and forgot to warn my brother not to walk down them yet. 

Later, my older brother slipped and nearly died due to a brain injury from the fall, I hate to admit it but at the time I didn’t care that he almost died. After this incident he became bed bound, he couldn’t speak, or walk anymore. I was by his bedside everyday, bathing him when he needed me to and preparing his feeding tube. I hated him more than ever, after all he did why I have to take care of my abuser. I thought it was okay to hate him because he’d just get better. Unfortunately, There were some serious complications from the fall and he died in October. I hate myself for this more and more everyday, my mother has refused to talk to me about it she 100% blames me since I wasn’t invited to the service. Since this happened I haven’t felt anything but remorse, I’m trying to find ways to forgive him and myself.

[Edit]
Some further information about the situation..

I’m currently a minor and unable to leave home or receive therapy without my parents knowing, I’m taking AP classes so hopefully I can graduate sooner and get out ASAP. 

I appreciate the responses to this post it’s been healing to hear some outside perspective. Following the incident in august 2024 there was a small investigation conducted by some sort of APS/his case worker and they said it was terrible accident, I was questioned about cleaning an hour prior. From the minimal information I was let in on, he had sustained damage to his carotid artery in his neck and brain from the way he fell (he had some side issues from his disability already which deteriorated his condition further), he had a passed in the middle of the night a few months later, my mother found him early in the morning. 

Since then my parents haven’t talked to me about it, they withheld the date of his funeral from me, leaving me at home. The only acknowledgement about the incident my mother gave me was in December she gave me passing comment about how I wanted this to happen because I never liked him anyway due to his condition. My father hasn’t said a word to me since September. Due to this communication I think they left part of the conclusion to the investigation out and it’s killing me. 

After the service people would be in and out of our home to help with our family, they would comfort me about being a good sister/caretaker, it didn’t feel right since I had murdered him. I was so scared my mother would tell them what really happens and everyone would see me as a monster.

My brother was her favorite child and I think she believes I willed him out of existence, like I had planned all of these events to happen. I catch my mother in his bed sobbing sometimes or staring at the ceiling and the guilt starts all over again. Whenever I’m home from school alone the door to his room is locked and all of his stuff is in there, they don’t want me to be near any of his belongings. I’m still trying to forgive him and forgive myself but my parents blaming me and knowing if family knew they would too doesn’t help. ","I regret hating my disabled older brother after he passed Throwaway for obvious reasons.

So for context my older brother was disabled, he couldn’t drive/read/write and he has the brain age of a 6 year old at 33. When I was younger he would abuse me, physically, verbally and had consistently attempted to rape me. I was told to keep quiet about these instances because my parents didn’t want to look irresponsible, I understand that is their fault. But I think they’ve raised a monster, whenever my brother got the chance (which was almost everyday)  he’d spit, kick or hit me fully knowing that it’s harmful to me (he’s bigger and stronger than me), i had tried to talk him through this but since my parents have told me he can’t help himself or it’s his condition causing these issues. I’ve occasionally caught him trying to watch me shower too which is another thing he had done in harassing me. He’d constantly turn my mother against me, blaming me for things I didn’t do. I wanted him to disappear in anyway possible.

19562,1hz9sxo,post,I’m starting to think I’m crazy for suspecting my dad ,"
For years, I’ve been trying to understand the relationship between me and my dad. It’s been complicated, and I don’t want to be a bitch; but at the same time, I haven’t felt completely safe around him at certain points of life, and it has taken a lot of work just to be able to stand my ground, figure things out, and separate myself from him emotionally. 

Before I go into details, I want to say that I don’t want to put him in jail or unnecessarily ruin his life. I just need closure. 

He used to be very harsh with me, expecting me to behave and work perfectly. He’s locked me out for short amounts of time when I was age 7&9. He often used to threaten to send me away. He refused to let me attend attend school till I was in my mid/late teens
But at the same time, he was very loving. He tolerated a lot of attitude from me. In my teens, he apologized for the things he did wrong when I was a child. 

Ten months back, I tried to set my list of chores because I didn’t want him to force me to take on last-minute or a ton of work a lot of the time, like he did when I was younger. I pointed out recent times he messed up chores, because he often had me cover for him last minute. He got mad and threatened to kick me out of the house if I was disrespectful. 

He then apologized after I confronted him. But I was on edge for months after, and I’d bring it up. He would still try to blame his words on my attitude and claimed we hadn’t discussed it after the incident. Then, a few weeks back, he apologized in a way that sounded really sincere. 

I wasn’t sure if I should let my guard down. As I have told my parents, even if one problem gets resolved, something else happens to cause a problem or make me feel like his mindset has not really changed. 

Since I was younger, my dad has been very physically affectionate. I didn’t mind that, and I was very affectionate with him too. But there are many times I didn’t want him to touch me, and he would still touch me or hug me. Sometimes, he would do it more than a dozen times an evening. He wasn’t touching my privates. 

When I was twelve, my mom got upset with him and confronted him. In between the conversation, I went to use the bathroom. We were in one bedroom with an attached bathroom at the time. He came into the bathroom and bent down briefly and looked under at me using the toilet. 
 
Mom got more upset, yelled at him, then left us for a few minutes to talk. While we were alone, he said he had no idea what she was talking about. Then, when she came back, I assured her everything was fine. Stupid mistake on my part. 

Then, fast forward a while, I started suspecting that he was touching me inappropriately in my sleep. But I never caught him, and I honestly don’t know for sure if he was. I think one night I caught his hand leaving my pants, and I was stunned; but I don’t know for sure. I don’t even remember how old I was— just that it was after I turned thirteen, because of the house we’d moved into at the time. 

I started “sleeping” next to him at night but trying to stay awake so I could catch him to see if he was actually doing something.

One day, during the daytime, while mom was out, he sandwiched me against a kitchen wall and kissed me once on the lips. It wasn’t a quick peck and done. Then, he took me into our office-bedroom, and we sat down. He asked me if something was wrong, and I said no. He didn’t go any further. 

I’ve written about this before, and I have sought help. But every time I try to seek help, it doesn’t work out. 

Today, I talked to my parents about it all, first with both my parents, then with just mom. Dad was calm and apologized. I got upset, saying that he’s apologized before but the actions and patterns continue. Mom told him to act on his apology, rather than say it. 

 Mom was really sad that she didn’t remember the bathroom incident. She was on my side, like she’d been before, without jumping to incriminate dad either. I wasn’t hugely accusing, I think, either. I did say that, considering the fact that he continues to touch me several times within a few minutes after I tell him to stop, it doesn’t feel like he’s just doing it out of habit because of personality. 

Mom said that, when she had confronted dad just for touching me, she had gotten mad at dad but that she was just taking out the anger of a lot of circumstances out on him. She explained several incidents that I’d heard about that made him look fishy, but they weren’t his fault. 

I said I was willing to consider the past, major incidents to be misunderstandings. But the even present touching me after we agreed to set boundaries made things a bit suspicious. 

Mom said that how I felt was valid. She said that if I felt uncomfortable and those things happened, then she would talk to him. 

She asked if we could give him three days and watch his behavior and then she would talk to him. 

Amidst all that, I told her I was confused. I didn’t want to let the matter go, but I wasn’t extremely accusing either, I feel like. 

I also used a backup account just to ask about the touching, without mentioning the other details, so I could have a different perspective. A good number of the people who interacted on my post thought I was overreacting. Some agreed I should have boundaries. A couple were strong about me maintaining boundaries and defending myself. One guy listened to my explaination and changed from saying that I was overreacting to saying sorry and that I was not. Other people downvoted my explaination/defense still. 


Edit: Mom being a witness to the bathroom incident was my biggest factor. But now that she doesn’t remember, I’ve got less to go on. If things do work out and I feel like I can trust him, our relationship won’t be affected. I know because I’ve brought up this once before and let it go because I wasn’t sure enough to go through with it. And he’s clearly not been deterred from being physical with me. 

Also, in my other post, I mentioned how dad was trying to get past me quickly and dug his fingers in me hard enough to hurt. He apologized, but I was still upset that he used enough force to hurt. Since I’m thick skinned and a bit strong, it takes some amount of force. When I told mom, she said he did it on purpose and that she’d talk to him. This happened a couple days ago. 

My bottom line is that I just want to know how to feel. I don’t know if I’m viewing this the wrong way, especially since my parents were very open and apologetic. And, though they’d always been nice, they’ve changed a lot over the years to be better. And it’s caused friction that I over analyze every word, expression, or action from him. 

On the other hand, I’m tired of the cycle of being upset, letting things go, then having some other action or behavior come up that make me think he hasn’t really changed, then being upset again.

19566,1hz1atj,post,"I dont know how to cope with hard times, Is this the best way to lift something off my chest","Hi, I'm (22) who recently got out of a 5 year relationship. I'm a person who mostly handle situations maturely, but as of now I dont know how to feel and what to do.

Growing up has been really challenging for me, since my dad was a gambling and a sex addict. It was mostly fun affairs and late night Bingo for him and casino slot machines. I didn't actually get to know him that much since he was always away from home, while my mom was a bit self-centered and was always looking for what's best for her self. she just kept on chasing my dad and his money. they would mostly leave us at home whenever they were in good terms with each other saying me and my brothers deserve to be left at home because we were lazy and all, at age 7.

As I became a teenager around 16, I was craving for love that I never got to have with anyone. the thought of someone valuing you and appreciate you of your existence alone made me felt that i needed something like that to have a purpose. I started to begin dating at around this age in Senior High school and met my ex on a dating site. I didn't loved my ex at first, it was just like somebody was always there for me whenever I feel gloomy and lonely. 

My ex was around 24 years old while I was about to turn 17 at that time. We talked and talked, until at some point we made it official. As time passes by, It went good, we were always there for each other and I get to vent how messy and messed up my family is.

In the 3rd year of our relationship, one night, I dreamt of my ex having a meetup in a hotel and doing some funny business. and I told my ex about it because it made me feel warry and sad. we had a long talk until we fell asleep, as we were sleeping i woke up feeling thirsty in the middle of the night and his phone started to light up multiple times, I don't normally check in on his phone because i trust him enough. but at that night, i just went and grabbed his phone. and when I was looking through the messages, i read a lot of messages that broke me like "" hey, that was fun. we should do it more""  and how they updated on each other and went straight to the hotel.

to cut the story short, I forgave him and he promised not to do it ever again. and I fully trusted him because he was my first in everything. and I was really afraid of going back to zero and start from the beginning with someone again... I know...
I tried my best to be so mature in everything, and until one day I started to have this heaviness on my shoulders, like i was carrying the entire world with me. and problems started filling in, my dad was too caught up with his bad habbits. We were having a predicament going for me to go to college, then my mom kept on giving  me advices like that I should just drop out of school and get a Call center job at another city so that I could help her with the bills at home. and without thinking, I agreed to it.

 I mostly failed with the interviews at first because LOL it was hard and english is my 3rd language, and i used to remember how my mom keeps on comparing me to one of our cousin, on how late I was in life and that she would rather have my cousin as her son. and how i bring badluck to the family.

It was really a mess, and i started to have this extreme heaviness on my shoulders, I thought it was just a phase. but suddenly there I was with panic attacks in public. I went to a psychiatrist and was diagnosed with Anxiety disorder and Clinical Depression from all the traumas I've been through at a young age. my ex was there but he didn't like the idea of me being depressed and there was a major shift on our sexual life.

(and btw, im the youngest. i have 2 older brothers, i know it must be hard for them as well) but sometimes i feel like my mom is relying on me, like im always responsible for my brothers.

during the pandemic my parents went their own ways. I had to move to the other city i was talking about and landed a job in a call center, i was doing my best and was performing well. my ex visits me once a month or twice even thou we live really far.

and just this year 2024, My dad went home to spain ( I'm half spanish) and he just found out that he had cancer, so he tried his best to catch up with us. Idk, if he regret being an asshole. but im a bit glad that I get to have another chance with him. I know that they aren't perfect and i dont entirely hate them because I know it's their first time being a parent too. but it could've been better if things aren't the way it currently is.

I had to quit my job to process my spanish citizenship to live with my dad. while i was processing my documents, I didn't know it would take long, my ex told me to look for a job near his hometown so we could live together for a while. and ofc, i did. I got a job, still in a customer service industry because it was the only job that I know how. and couple weeks later, my ex keeps on going through my phone like i was doing something wrong. and again, I just have a feeling that things weren't right. I snatched up his phone again while he was sleeping, and i found out that while i was going through depression, he was going out with multiple people, meeting 3-4 persons each month to have sex with for the entire span of 2 years. and at that moment my perspective changed, i kept on asking myself what and where did i go wrong this time? I never cheat, even thou I always had the opportunity and chance to.

The last two months before I left my country and him was a bit bumpy, it made me lost interest in lots of things, i started to hate my job, my hobbies, and it made me a bit bitter for people. but i gained a hobby that made me escape from most of it, i normally spend the night at a coastal pier alone. he would find me there crying and talking to God how unfair life is. he told me how sorry he was and promised me that he would wait for me to come back home, and that he'll be the best version of himself. and when i heard those words, i already know that deep down that wouldn't happen. I told him to leave after he said everything. I was trying to keep it all in and hold my sanity, and then I reached for a coin in my pocket, thinking that the coin was me, and every bad things that happened was channelled up to the coin, and when i was ready to leave i promised myself that i wouldn't go through such a thing again, and I THREW it really hard into the ocean. thinking that im gonna leave everything behind including him and not gonna experience anything like that ever again.
( you may find it funny, but it helped me a little)

I still forgave him throughout everything, and he even went to the airport with me, to say our last goodbye. He asked me not to block him on social media, and i told him, why would I ? im still grateful for everything even thou it didn't go to how we want it to be.

And now, it's almost my 3rd month in spain, he still reaches out to me, and i told him to go out there and find someone who u really want to spend ur life with because life is short.

I still question and tell myself that i might did something wrong too for idk what reasons. and i couldn't help myself to feel lonely most of the time.
I want to find love again and at the same time I dont trust anybody enough. I mostly recieve messages from people on social media, but i never open them. I tried going on tinder but i just dont feel like it anymore, I pray to God every single night that I want to find love, someone i can share all this thoughts and heartache with.

I know it's a bit stupid and that i should prioritize the important things, but it gets too overwhelming at times and i don't have friends here and im still learning spanish, and most of the time i feel really bad about myself because i dont have a job and most jobs here are required to speak at least a decent amount of spanish and catalan.  My life is a bit of a mess, as likely as how i am writing this. but.

anyway, i just feel like to get this out of my system because nobody knows what we are going through, I just hope things will align however we want it to be.
","I dont know how to cope with hard times, Is this the best way to lift something off my chest Hi, I'm (22) who recently got out of a 5 year relationship. I'm a person who mostly handle situations maturely, but as of now I dont know how to feel and what to do.

Growing up has been really challenging for me, since my dad was a gambling and a sex addict. It was mostly fun affairs and late night Bingo for him and casino slot machines. I didn't actually get to know him that much since he was always away from home, while my mom was a bit self-centered and was always looking for what's best for her self. she just kept on chasing my dad and his money. they would mostly leave us at home whenever they were in good terms with each other saying me and my brothers deserve to be left at home because we were lazy and all, at age 7.

As I became a teenager around 16, I was craving for love that I never got to have with anyone. the thought of someone valuing you and appreciate you of your existence alone made me felt that i needed something like that to have a purpose. I started to begin dating at around this age in Senior High school and met my ex on a dating site. I didn't loved my ex at first, it was just like somebody was always there for me whenever I feel gloomy and lonely. 

My ex was around 24 years old while I was about to turn 17 at that time. We talked and talked, until at some point we made it official. As time passes by, It went good, we were always there for each other and I get to vent how messy and messed up my family is.

In the 3rd year of our relationship, one night, I dreamt of my ex having a meetup in a hotel and doing some funny business. and I told my ex about it because it made me feel warry and sad. we had a long talk until we fell asleep, as we were sleeping i woke up feeling thirsty in the middle of the night and his phone started to light up multiple times, I don't normally check in on his phone because i trust him enough. but at that night, i just went and grabbed his phone. and when I was looking through the messages, i read a lot of messages that broke me like "" hey, that was fun. we should do it more""  and how they updated on each other and went straight to the hotel.

to cut the story short, I forgave him and he promised not to do it ever again. and I fully trusted him because he was my first in everything. and I was really afraid of going back to zero and start from the beginning with someone again... I know...
I tried my best to be so mature in everything, and until one day I started to have this heaviness on my shoulders, like i was carrying the entire world with me. and problems started filling in, my dad was too caught up with his bad habbits. We were having a predicament going for me to go to college, then my mom kept on giving  me advices like that I should just drop out of school and get a Call center job at another city so that I could help her with the bills at home. and without thinking, I agreed to it.

 I mostly failed with the interviews at first because LOL it was hard and english is my 3rd language, and i used to remember how my mom keeps on comparing me to one of our cousin, on how late I was in life and that she would rather have my cousin as her son. and how i bring badluck to the family.

It was really a mess, and i started to have this extreme heaviness on my shoulders, I thought it was just a phase. but suddenly there I was with panic attacks in public. I went to a psychiatrist and was diagnosed with Anxiety disorder and Clinical Depression from all the traumas I've been through at a young age. my ex was there but he didn't like the idea of me being depressed and there was a major shift on our sexual life.

(and btw, im the youngest. i have 2 older brothers, i know it must be hard for them as well) but sometimes i feel like my mom is relying on me, like im always responsible for my brothers.

during the pandemic my parents went their own ways. I had to move to the other city i was talking about and landed a job in a call center, i was doing my best and was performing well. my ex visits me once a month or twice even thou we live really far.

and just this year 2024, My dad went home to spain ( I'm half spanish) and he just found out that he had cancer, so he tried his best to catch up with us. Idk, if he regret being an asshole. but im a bit glad that I get to have another chance with him. I know that they aren't perfect and i dont entirely hate them because I know it's their first time being a parent too. but it could've been better if things aren't the way it currently is.

I had to quit my job to process my spanish citizenship to live with my dad. while i was processing my documents, I didn't know it would take long, my ex told me to look for a job near his hometown so we could live together for a while. and ofc, i did. I got a job, still in a customer service industry because it was the only job that I know how. and couple weeks later, my ex keeps on going through my phone like i was doing something wrong. and again, I just have a feeling that things weren't right. I snatched up his phone again while he was sleeping, and i found out that while i was going through depression, he was going out with multiple people, meeting 3-4 persons each month to have sex with for the entire span of 2 years. and at that moment my perspective changed, i kept on asking myself what and where did i go wrong this time? I never cheat, even thou I always had the opportunity and chance to.

The last two months before I left my country and him was a bit bumpy, it made me lost interest in lots of things, i started to hate my job, my hobbies, and it made me a bit bitter for people. but i gained a hobby that made me escape from most of it, i normally spend the night at a coastal pier alone. he would find me there crying and talking to God how unfair life is. he told me how sorry he was and promised me that he would wait for me to come back home, and that he'll be the best version of himself. and when i heard those words, i already know that deep down that wouldn't happen.

Currently I am pursuing [B.tech](http://B.tech) and she is pursuing CA. Lets go back to class 6th.Yes it was 6th class when i saw a girl entering the class. Everybody was busy with each other talking doing all sorts of stuff but i was looking only at one person. It was her. At that moment I experienced what love at first sight was. However I being dumb enough never had the courage to confess her. Confess her that I like her. We were good friends and used to talk about stuff. At school people also made rumours about us as well but I thought that these cant be real Why the hell would she like me.(Biggest blunder of my life). Ok so time passed by 6th then 7th and then till 12th I always had a chance to confess her but always stopped at the last moment with the fear of rejection. School ended i started pursuing B.tech. And lets get back in december 2024 . I made my instagram profile and send friend reqs to all my friends and hence send her the req as well. Well she accepted. It was new year so i wished her happy new year and i dont know but a conversation was initiated. And suddenly the feelings that i buried deep down in my heart started to rise up. And then i realized I was always in love with her but it was just buried in my heart. I didnt know how to tackle this. But somehow i wanted to make one last attemp as we were online and couldnt meet so i thought even i get rejected straight away i wont have to face her. So i started making some small talks and one day straight away just confessed with a long message. I was expecting a straight rejection but to my surprise she replied. ""Wait I am confused you know right i liked you back then. And my world began to shake my heart began pounding. I wasnt expecting that. I asked what she is talking about she said that she thought i knew that she liked me. and i thought just one thing ""I fked up"".So i tried to handle the situation by saying I never had any idea that she liked me as well otherwise I would have confessed straight away. Then I threw my final move I asked her"" Do I still have a chance or I missed it"" and she replied I dont think so its possible now. And my world broke. I would have gladly accepted a rejection straight away but knowing that i was this close to confess her and getting a positive response I felt horrible. I never thought that she also felt for me.

And with that I started to wrap up the conversation.Thanked her for giving me the clarity but she responded positively by stating we could still be friends. I gladly accepted as I lost  my love but didnt lost my friend atleast.

So guys I want to say one thing never hesitate in confessing.

At worst he/she will reject but you wont have the regret that if I would have shown courage things could have been different.

Thats it thanks for reading my post.

19569,1i4dw0l,post,"Teachers forced me to pull up my skirt to prove to them I had shorts on, I was 13.","Mention of: child on child sa and sa

This was March 2022 and I was into the whole “alternative” look. So, I would wear skirts that were a little too short for school, and I can admit that.

I was in my math class, just messing around with my friends. I was then called out of the class room by the 8th grade science teacher and her assistant, at that time I had no idea who they were and what their names were.

Right as I walked into the hallway, I was imitating told to lift up my skirt. Like one would do, I told them no and that there’s other students in the hallway and i’m uncomfortable. After us going back and forth for less than a minute, I lifted up my skirt to just get it over with.

I went back into class, trying not to cry from feeling embarrassed and dirty. My friends were asking me what was wrong, I wrote what happened on a paper, they took turns passing it to each other, and then my (male) math teacher came up to me and yelled at me for saying what happened and “They don’t need to know what happened”. 

I was already dealing with being sexually assaulted by a kid in my class for 3 months and then continued for another 3 months after that, but that’s a different story. So with the anxiety I had going to school because of that, made everything so much worse.

I later called my dad to pick me up from school. My mom, who obviously would be upset, called the principal. All my mom got as a response is to switch schools that are 30min-1hr away from where we live and that they won’t do anything about what just happened.

I’m now 16 and a sophomore in high school. The science teacher and assistant retired, along with my principal getting fired that next year. Last year the kid was reported for sa from many other students and they let him switch schools so no legal issues happened.","Teachers forced me to pull up my skirt to prove to them I had shorts on, I was 13.

For context, we’ve known each other since we were 15 and are now 22. He always had a crush on me, but we stayed friends because I genuinely liked him as a friend. We lost contact from 18-20 but reconnected at 21. Over the past year, we texted, FaceTimed, and hung out a lot.

In September, he randomly blocked me for two months. He later apologized, saying he thought I hated him after lying about being a virgin. I forgave him because I’m a forgiving person.

19571,1htuip5,post,How SA effects you giving birth in the future .....,"So I've never really been open about this before. But I thought I'd share my experience cause no one talks about or prepares you for birth when you have been raped or sexual assaulted in some way. 

When I was 17 I was raped for 2 months by my very first boyfriend. I didn't quite process this until I was about 19 with my daughters father. He helped me really process it all. 

Flash forward to 20. I got pregnant. Everything was great but then my baby girl didn't want to come out. It was past my due date. I did not dialate once. The doctors did a membrane sweep and dilated me 1cm. The sweep didn't bother me cause I was so tired of waiting and wanted her out lol she ended up being 11lbs so I was quite big and swollen. 

My body went from 1cm back to 0cm. She didn't want to come out. I went in for an induction. Since I wasn't dilated at all I couldn't get the medicine IV drip that Induces the labor. So, the first thing they did was put a pill inside me and behind my cervix to help soften it and dialate me. Then after 2 rounds of that they tried putting this string in my cervix with medicine (these two are called Cytadel and Cytotec I think) and that didn't work either. 

Now I say all this and it seems like oh okay I had some doctors doing things to me and it wasn't working. But ever since the first cervix check they did where they put their hand in me I struggled. Through every medicine they had to force into me I said no please don't please don't. And my mother had to soothe me while I cried out in pain and they put their hand in me and pushed my cervix  to get the pill behind it. In order to get me through it my mom would soothe me and hold my hand and whisper in my ear about this flamingo sanctuary in key West. I love the tropics and flamingos. She would describe it in detail and sing to me. (My daughters father held my hand and wiped my tears but I needed my mother in this moment. He was great during the birth)  

At one point I couldn't loosen up at all and the doctor kept telling me to calm down and it got so bad my body tightened on her hand and her hand was stuck in me. I had to focus on my breathing. To have my body release her hand. This happened over the course of 2 days. Being woken up for cervix checks, putting another pill behind my cervix, etc. At the end of the second day they put the string in me again with the gel. They have to force my cervix open to place it inside. It started forcing me to go into labor through the night and I had my first couple contractions. 

I made the nurse take it out, despite her not wanting to cause it was working. I told them that if my body has refused to dialate there is a reason and I don't want to force it. I wanted a c section. They gave in and I had a c section w an 11lb baby the next morning and they told me I was right. And if I had not taken that string out I would have ended up with many stitches in my vaginal area, a large tear, and an emergency c section. 

I have since struggled daily since this happened to me. My GYN has never in my history of being there asked about my past sexual traumas. And I didn't know this would effect me till I was in the hospital. No one talks about this. 

All I can remember is the constant checks and watching the time on the clock tick away for the next round of medicine or check. And I remember screaming and screaming for help. But in reality I was silently crying and asking for it to end when they had their hand in me forcing my cervix open and to move. I think on the inside I was screaming and this is why I remember it this way. 

When I brought it up to her father a month after her birth and that I was struggling he told me there's no reason and it's not possible to have trauma from being in the hospital cause the doctors are there to help. They aren't raping me or assaulting me. And they weren't. But they also weren't sensitive and didn't ask questions about my reactions. 

I'm no longer with her father for other reasons. And have started therapy. It's been almost 4 years since I gave birth and I left that GYN and have a new one and was open with them about my experiences and why pap smear and exams are very hard for me. They are amazing and ask the needed questions to make sure I'm comfortable. I also had them put in my medical records that if I am to have a baby again I WILL have a c section and not a VBAC. 

I just want to put this out there as something to think about for expecting mothers or people wanting to have a baby and to brace yourself or communicate heavily before it's time to have the baby if you have past trauma. I want everyone with past tramua to have a beautiful and comfortable birth of their baby. They all deserve it so much. ","How SA effects you giving birth in the future .....

Flash forward to 20. I got pregnant. Everything was great but then my baby girl didn't want to come out. It was past my due date. I did not dialate once. The doctors did a membrane sweep and dilated me 1cm. The sweep didn't bother me cause I was so tired of waiting and wanted her out lol she ended up being 11lbs so I was quite big and swollen. 

My body went from 1cm back to 0cm. She didn't want to come out. I went in for an induction. Since I wasn't dilated at all I couldn't get the medicine IV drip that Induces the labor. So, the first thing they did was put a pill inside me and behind my cervix to help soften it and dialate me. Then after 2 rounds of that they tried putting this string in my cervix with medicine (these two are called Cytadel and Cytotec I think) and that didn't work either. 

Now I say all this and it seems like oh okay I had some doctors doing things to me and it wasn't working. But ever since the first cervix check they did where they put their hand in me I struggled. Through every medicine they had to force into me I said no please don't please don't. And my mother had to soothe me while I cried out in pain and they put their hand in me and pushed my cervix  to get the pill behind it. In order to get me through it my mom would soothe me and hold my hand and whisper in my ear about this flamingo sanctuary in key West. I love the tropics and flamingos. She would describe it in detail and sing to me. (My daughters father held my hand and wiped my tears but I needed my mother in this moment. He was great during the birth)  

At one point I couldn't loosen up at all and the doctor kept telling me to calm down and it got so bad my body tightened on her hand and her hand was stuck in me. I had to focus on my breathing. To have my body release her hand. This happened over the course of 2 days. Being woken up for cervix checks, putting another pill behind my cervix, etc. At the end of the second day they put the string in me again with the gel. They have to force my cervix open to place it inside. It started forcing me to go into labor through the night and I had my first couple contractions. 

I made the nurse take it out, despite her not wanting to cause it was working. I told them that if my body has refused to dialate there is a reason and I don't want to force it. I wanted a c section. They gave in and I had a c section w an 11lb baby the next morning and they told me I was right. And if I had not taken that string out I would have ended up with many stitches in my vaginal area, a large tear, and an emergency c section. 

I have since struggled daily since this happened to me. My GYN has never in my history of being there asked about my past sexual traumas. And I didn't know this would effect me till I was in the hospital. No one talks about this. 

All I can remember is the constant checks and watching the time on the clock tick away for the next round of medicine or check. And I remember screaming and screaming for help. But in reality I was silently crying and asking for it to end when they had their hand in me forcing my cervix open and to move. I think on the inside I was screaming and this is why I remember it this way. 

When I brought it up to her father a month after her birth and that I was struggling he told me there's no reason and it's not possible to have trauma from being in the hospital cause the doctors are there to help. They aren't raping me or assaulting me. And they weren't. But they also weren't sensitive and didn't ask questions about my reactions. 

I'm no longer with her father for other reasons. And have started therapy. It's been almost 4 years since I gave birth and I left that GYN and have a new one and was open with them about my experiences and why pap smear and exams are very hard for me. They are amazing and ask the needed questions to make sure I'm comfortable. I also had them put in my medical records that if I am to have a baby again I WILL have a c section and not a VBAC. 

I just want to put this out there as something to think about for expecting mothers or people wanting to have a baby and to brace yourself or communicate heavily before it's time to have the baby if you have past trauma. I want everyone with past tramua to have a beautiful and comfortable birth of their baby. They all deserve it so much.

Since everything kicked off it's just been a downard spiral of history repeating itself and I did the thing I thought I would never do, I let go.

I blocked all my family on everything, I blocked all the ties I had to my childhood and the trauma I endured. I just hope it was the right thing, it feels like the noise around my neck is loosening but I don't feel free yet.

I know I have more work to do but I think I'll get there! 

Thank you everyone for your lovely comments, you really helped me out through one of the worst times in my life and opened my eyes to the patterns I fell into so from the bottom of my heart, I don't know who any of you are but I will be forever grateful!!




This is a throwaway account because obviously I haven't really told anyone other than my Fiancé any of this.

Currently I'm lying awake at 28 finding out today that my grandad died and it's bringing up a lot of emotional turmoil and I need to release it.

I grew up in a religious household and everything was great until I turned 8. My best friend who was 8 asked me one night to play truth or day and I thought nothing of it but then it lead to him forcing me to put it in my mouth and bum. I being a child and wanting friends thought nothing of it, never considered it abuse just thought it was friends playing around and this went on for 2 years. Around the same time this happened I remember my mum came home screaming one night she was raped and went into graphic detail of what happened and that messed up the entire world.

She later became and alcoholic and was diagnosed with schizophrenia. My dad became angry all the time. When my mum had episodes she would hurt herself (two that sticks out was seeing a lot of self harm remnants around the house because she thought her limbs were speaking to her or when she started sneaking into all her rooms to protect us from the ""demons""). I was trying to deal with all the anger and confusion that she felt but any time I did something wrong my dad would start choking me or beating me. He wasn't a protector, he was cruel and calculated. Again, I thought this was normal.

When I wasn't going to school because I was being bullied, I had no one to talk to and when I wouldn't go to school he would punch me or whack me with a brush because well I dunno, just because. Then also dealing with the situation with my friend that I couldn't talk to and the stuff with my mum and siblings.

I was lost and alone. Once they separated I would see my mum on a Wednesday afternoon from 10 years old I would cook, clean, do the chores and get the heating on. She was very incoherent for the first 4 years after the divorce so I done everything to care for her but when she was coherent and cooking again it felt amazing and like I had my mum back but then when I went back to my dad's house, the beatings would continue.

At the age of 15 this all came full circle, I was living this ""norma"" life and fucked up drastically. My brother's friend asked what semen looked like and I showed him. My friend did it with me so in my head the logic was ""we're friends and my friend showed me"". He was 11/12 at the time and when I look back on it I realize how fucked up it all was but at the time I legitimately didn't know better. I had zero role models. My dad would publicly screw married women and then treat them like they're nothing and didn't care who saw what. My mum was amazing 1/10 of the time but she never layed a hand on me so I loved her with all my heart. 

She died when I was 16 and I had no escape from my dad after that. After all the abuse, all the crap I dealt with, I realized then and there that I was alone. Until my grandad, her father, stepped up, he didn't report the abuse but he would always pick me up and collect me after it happened to make sure I was okay, he treated me with respect and dignity and showed me so much compassion. He was my role model of the person I wanted to be. Soft, kind, caring and gentle. I tried everything to be like him after mum died but stuff with my dad just kept getting worse.

My brother and sisters were there too but I got the worst of everything, when they were hit I would get my dad off them then take the brunt of it and they were too young to do anything.
When I tried to report it, they obviously took my dad's side out of fear.

For reference it got so bad that my dad broke my rib and dislocated my jaw and when I was older I ruptured his kidney and smashed a guitar over him because he wouldn't stop hitting my brother.

At 20 I went to therapy and was due to be tested for autism but my dad's response was ""absolutely fucking not, I don't have a r-word son"" (I'm censoring the word because I know it's very triggering for people). 
At 21 after countless suicide attempts and self harming unfold my dad about how he impacted me and he denied everything and didn't take accountability at all. I told him about what happened to me as a kid, about how at 18 I was groomed by a 60 year old man.
Who would visit my dying cousins house and then when he passed away tragically at 16, said man told me my uncle said it would be good for me to go to a stag night and he then sexually assaulted me on the stag night continuously (back then and growing up I couldn't say no to anything or anyone). And the last time it was spiked and raped it was by my dad's cousin.

My dad didn't bat an eye just asked ""why didn't you tell me"" so that's when I told him about everything he's done to me"".

I was done and moved far away. We started to develop a healthy relationship until a couple of months ago. The person who I showed my sperm to accused me of so much shit that it's beyond belief. He's done it in the past with other people but he got drunk with my dad and told him everything. I already know I'm a piece of shit for it and my dad used it as an excuse to beat me as a kid and honestly I believe him. My dad said everything I learned at 21 and after years of therapy, abuse begets abuse and I am scum for doing that stuff to him and that I'm a monster and how he can't look at me. I'm just that scared little boy that's stuck again.

I don't deserve to live after everything and should have been gone a long time ago. Now the person I looked up to and cherished passed away and I can't go to the funeral because my dad will be there with his friend (the father of the son i showed my sperm to as a kid).

He wants to kill me which I don't blame him for but my dad made it very clear that I shouldn't go because it's not safe for me there. So that's where I am now, spiralling back to that scared kid fighting to be alive but I don't have the energy to keep fighting. I love my Fiancé but I don't want any of this on him so I just feel it'd be better for everyone if I was gone too.","I don't know if I can take living anymore because of how my situation was growing up Update:

19573,1h3x2q4,post,Questionable encounter from years agi that weighed in me ,"Tw: sexual assault related

Years ago I had sort of reconnected with an ex several years after an amicable breakup. She came to a party weekend with some mutual friends in her city and we had a fun time partying and talking. A couple weeks later she was in my city for work and called me from the bar late at night asking me to take her back to her hotel.

In retrospect, she was just hoping for a free ride back, but at the time I thought based on our recent fun that she wanted to hook up. 

I went and picked her up and drove to her hotel(not a good move to begin with as I had been drinking a little bit). She was very chatty drunk but not obviously hammered or a mess. When we got to the hotel, we kept talking in the car slighlty flirtatiously. I was waiting for an invite up, and retrospectively I think she just didn't know how to leave without feeling rude that she used me for a ride, so we talked for an oddly.long time, like 20 mins in the hotel parking lot, and then she invited me up. 

When we got to her room, we were still in the mode where I was sort of expecting to hook up but she kept chatting. I never really made a move but just hung out talking. I can't remember exactly how it started, but we gradually started making out and began having sex. The sex was... very unexceptionable and fast. After finishing, she seemed to be asleep. It really seemed incongruous since she had been talking and mutually initiating sex, but I thought she felt awkward about bad sex and didn't want to address it, so I went to sleep too.

In the morning, I was still expecting a fun light-hearted wakeup with potential redemption sexiness, but her vibe was very much 'get the hell out of my hotel room I am late and have to get ready for work' so that's what I did.

We texted that day and she was sort of talking about not remembering everything from the night before. Without even thinking about the night's events, I started a dumb bit that would have been normal with our friends and with her at that time, and making stuff up and saying she just didn't remember - mainly that she invited me to her family dinner that night. She obviously didn't want me to come but kinda fell for it and rolled with it. I let it go for a few texts and then gave the haha jk. We sort of finished that conversation...and that was it. She went back to her city the next day, we didn't text each other, and our friend groups never crossed paths.

Several years later when metoo was forefront, I thought back at that encounter and was horrified to think that it might have been way different than how I thought it went. 

What if when I thought we we were flirty and chatting in my car, she felt pressured and didn't know how to just leave? What if she had the same feeling in her room and didn't want me there but didn't feel comfortable saying so? And maybe worst, what if she really was way drunker than I thought? What if she really was blacked out and didn't remember it? What if she really did fall asleep before/during and I didn't notice? What if when I was teasing her about not remembering, she was feeling that I took advantage of her black out? What if she felt that she was raped?

I tried many times to think of the details of how all of those transitions went, particularly how sexy started, but could never remember the exact details. I truly don't think I pressured or even initiated things, but I couldn't say with complete certainty. I was mostly sure the encounter was how i initially remembered it and it fit with our whole previous relationship, but that sliver of doubt or possibility was terrible.

I was haunted by this for a decade. I always feared seeing her. I feared that she was somehow publically accuse me of rape or assault. I feared that she would privately say it directly to me. And I feared that she felt it and was suffering from it. I began dating my now wife, who told me the story of her rape and I was horrifically afraid of how much that would hurt her to hear.

This was 12 years ago and tonight I saw that ex at a bar. She spotted me and came up to say hi. She was happy to see me and we caught up about family. That doesn't necessarily mean anything with certainty, but she definitely didn't seem to be holding ill will, and gave me confidence that the worst interpretation of that night is not accurate. At the very least, many of the scary possible scenarios involving seeing her didn't happen and are no longer hanging out there. 

I've never told a soul this story and am currently trying to process what it means to have this weight gone, and if I can truly let it go.
Thanks for reading and sorry if this scenario brought up anyone else's trauma.

19574,1gww0vy,post,TW// sa and r*pe … What sparked me to be an addict,"I was maybe 6 I remember my family was having a party/gathering they’re all Hispanic so these parties go for a long time. My cousin who’s maybe 2-4 years older than me,I actually don’t know his age exactly, came into my living room where I was and asked me to play with him and I was excited I’m the only girl in my group of cousins I have a handful of cousins and they’re all mostly boys I have 1 cousin who is a girl but she was in high school at the time so my cousins don’t always want to hangout with me. Anyways, I go to his room and he sits me down on his bed and tells me I need to be quiet and next thing I know he’s touching my private parts and grinding on me but our clothes never came off. I don’t remember a lot but I remember that and I remember he made it seem okay like it’s not a bad thing to do this together but it had to be a secret. And then anytime my family had a party I would be excited like I wonder if my cousin wants to play with me today. No one knows about it I never told anyone bc when I realized how bad that was, I was older and I feel like since I didn’t say no and we were close in age maybe it’s not that bad and I don’t wanna hurt my aunt and having her know this. I don’t know I just feel embarrassed and guilty.

In this point of time I am now maybe 7 I had a friend who lived on the ground floor of my apartment complex she once came up to play dolls with me and one day she said we should play in my closet and she started to play with herself and I asked what she was doing and she said she does that and it feels good and I should try it. I didn’t know what to do so she started to touch me and since my cousin does this to me I didn’t think it was bad. Then she started to lick me… if u get what I mean and I was scared but I didn’t want to scream for reason so I just let it happen. And then my mom came in my room and she stopped and pretended to play with my dolls and my mom opens the closet and asks why we were in here and my friend pretended like all we did was play dolls. My mom I think knew something was wrong bc she sat me down on my bed that night and asked me about it and asked me if she touched me inappropriately and I lied and said no and to leave me alone. I don’t know why I lied I feel like I didn’t want my friend to get in trouble. I stopped seeing her bc her family moved shortly after. 

In this point of time I am maybe 14 I moved away from most of my family. My parents decided to move us to the south since cost of living was cheaper and better hopes of owning a home than living in a small apartment. My mom decided I should go visit my family for the summer. I was so excited to see some of cousins and my aunts and uncles and being around my culture. However I forgot about that one cousin. I was in my aunts apartment for the whole summer and I learn the one cousin moved out, can’t remember if it was college or just In general, so it would be me and my two little cousins. Summer was great we had so much fun I loved being with my family. Then my cousin came for a surprise visit and gave me a hug as if everything was normal. I thought maybe he forgot what he used to do to me when I was little. So I thought okay I’ll forget about it too and maybe we can be normal. And we all sat on the couch watching YouTube videos it was whatever my two little cousins wanted to watch. We all were under a big blanket and then he started rubbing my leg. And again I froze like all emotions left my body and I felt nothing. I didn’t move I didn’t yell I didn’t blink just nothing. But that was it. I was scared to sleep. I remember me and some cousins went to the city and got comedy tickets and we couldn’t go in bc my one cousin was too young so we decided to go back tomorrow except it would only my be me and that one cousin. I wanted so bad to just be normal everyone else is normal why can’t we be normal? Then my aunt left us two alone since she had work and we were about to leave to go to a comedy show. Except we didn’t I was getting ready and I was scared I couldn’t ever do my makeup I felt nervous then he came up behind me and kissed my neck. I said “what are you doing?” And he said “just let me do this shut up” and I was too scared to fight back I was too scared to yell I just froze in fear and then I just went emotionless. Ugh I can remember his smell I don’t even know how to describe it but I can remember it. Remembering it makes me want to vomit. He had sex with me. I didn’t make a sound I was just numb and emotionless the whole time. At one time he wanted me to be on top and I said no and he was getting upset and grabbed my neck and I felt like he was going to hurt me in different ways so I gave in and got on top. When it was finally over I remember having tears run down my face but I was crying I felt nothing. I hated myself. I didn’t want to ruin lives like my aunt. She immigrated here got citizenship married a man had kids her husband cheated on her and then she divorced and he’s not the greatest dad. She’s a single mom who works so hard for her kids she loves them so much and she’s such a good mom she’s truly an amazing woman. I just don’t want to ruin her life. If I told someone they either won’t believe me then hate me or believe me and I ruin the family. I remember being in the shower for as long as I could scrubbing my body and no matter what I did I wasn’t clean. And everything around me felt filthy. I hate myself so much for not saying anything. 

This sparked my addiction. 

I started vaping which doesn’t seem so bad for a 14-15 year old. Then I was smoking weed, then I was self harming, then I started taking xans I almost overdosed on xans I was in high school my eyes were rolled back and I couldn’t make sentences I was mumbling I couldn’t keep my head up I was wandering the halls barley walking my friend said I looked like a zombie the way I walked I know this bc my friend took a video of me, I did cigarettes, I did coke, I did shrooms, I did molly, I took a random substance idk what it was someone gave it to me and I took it all I know is it looked like a flinstone vitamin but made u feel like u did coke, and I did oxy. From 14-24 years old. I am currently 24 and I have never ever told anyone about this ever. To this day I scrub my body and I still hate myself for allowing this. Only bright side is I got sober earlier this year in February. My boyfriend is just a great person and he deserves to be with someone who’s sober and more stable. So I got myself together ish. It’s a struggle every day. He and I are together for 4 years and I’ve never told him about this. I think I’m taking this with me to my grave. This here is my first time getting it off my chest and I definitely am not snot dripping crying. Worst part I have 3 more rape and sexual assault stories but I’ll get into that maybe another time. Thanks for reading ig.  ","TW// sa and r*pe … What sparked me to be an addict I was maybe 6 I remember my family was having a party/gathering they’re all Hispanic so these parties go for a long time. My cousin who’s maybe 2-4 years older than me,I actually don’t know his age exactly, came into my living room where I was and asked me to play with him and I was excited I’m the only girl in my group of cousins I have a handful of cousins and they’re all mostly boys I have 1 cousin who is a girl but she was in high school at the time so my cousins don’t always want to hangout with me. Anyways, I go to his room and he sits me down on his bed and tells me I need to be quiet and next thing I know he’s touching my private parts and grinding on me but our clothes never came off. I don’t remember a lot but I remember that and I remember he made it seem okay like it’s not a bad thing to do this together but it had to be a secret. And then anytime my family had a party I would be excited like I wonder if my cousin wants to play with me today. No one knows about it I never told anyone bc when I realized how bad that was, I was older and I feel like since I didn’t say no and we were close in age maybe it’s not that bad and I don’t wanna hurt my aunt and having her know this. I don’t know I just feel embarrassed and guilty.

In this point of time I am now maybe 7 I had a friend who lived on the ground floor of my apartment complex she once came up to play dolls with me and one day she said we should play in my closet and she started to play with herself and I asked what she was doing and she said she does that and it feels good and I should try it. I didn’t know what to do so she started to touch me and since my cousin does this to me I didn’t think it was bad. Then she started to lick me… if u get what I mean and I was scared but I didn’t want to scream for reason so I just let it happen. And then my mom came in my room and she stopped and pretended to play with my dolls and my mom opens the closet and asks why we were in here and my friend pretended like all we did was play dolls. My mom I think knew something was wrong bc she sat me down on my bed that night and asked me about it and asked me if she touched me inappropriately and I lied and said no and to leave me alone. I don’t know why I lied I feel like I didn’t want my friend to get in trouble. I stopped seeing her bc her family moved shortly after. 

In this point of time I am maybe 14 I moved away from most of my family. My parents decided to move us to the south since cost of living was cheaper and better hopes of owning a home than living in a small apartment. My mom decided I should go visit my family for the summer. I was so excited to see some of cousins and my aunts and uncles and being around my culture. However I forgot about that one cousin. I was in my aunts apartment for the whole summer and I learn the one cousin moved out, can’t remember if it was college or just In general, so it would be me and my two little cousins. Summer was great we had so much fun I loved being with my family. Then my cousin came for a surprise visit and gave me a hug as if everything was normal. I thought maybe he forgot what he used to do to me when I was little. So I thought okay I’ll forget about it too and maybe we can be normal. And we all sat on the couch watching YouTube videos it was whatever my two little cousins wanted to watch. We all were under a big blanket and then he started rubbing my leg. And again I froze like all emotions left my body and I felt nothing. I didn’t move I didn’t yell I didn’t blink just nothing. But that was it. I was scared to sleep. I remember me and some cousins went to the city and got comedy tickets and we couldn’t go in bc my one cousin was too young so we decided to go back tomorrow except it would only my be me and that one cousin. I wanted so bad to just be normal everyone else is normal why can’t we be normal? Then my aunt left us two alone since she had work and we were about to leave to go to a comedy show. Except we didn’t I was getting ready and I was scared I couldn’t ever do my makeup I felt nervous then he came up behind me and kissed my neck. I said “what are you doing?” And he said “just let me do this shut up” and I was too scared to fight back I was too scared to yell I just froze in fear and then I just went emotionless. Ugh I can remember his smell I don’t even know how to describe it but I can remember it. Remembering it makes me want to vomit. He had sex with me.

19575,1gus1zt,post,I was a “nice guy” and haven’t recovered to this day,"To the person who shared their “nice guy” moment: thank you for your courage and self-awareness. Your post inspired me to finally share a similar experience that’s been weighing on me for years. This happened when I was 19-20, I am now 22, feels like a decade ago.

Apologies in advance, I couldn’t figure out how to make this shorter and there’s at least 3 confessions in here.

I’ve always struggled with anxiety, which led to social isolation, awkwardness, and eventually depression. For a long time, I barely talked to anyone, but when I started college, I made a few friends. A year in, I met a girl I was interested in. We had classes together, saw each other at the gym, and I finally worked up the courage to say hi. I even suggested we work out sometime, though I never asked for her contact info—just starting a conversation was a big step for me.

To my surprise, she found me on Snapchat and messaged me to make plans. We started hanging out, and I learned she had a long-distance boyfriend. At the time, I told myself I could push aside any romantic feelings and just be her friend, even though I now realize that wasn’t honest with myself or fair to her.

We got closer over the months. We had so much in common—similar anxieties, shared traumas—and I found comfort in supporting her through her struggles. But over time, I became emotionally attached, more than I realized. She was distant at times, especially the week or two after breaking up with her boyfriend, but we continued hanging out and confiding in each other. I eventually tell her I have feelings for her and she says she’s never thought of me in that way before, so I forget about it. 

Fast forward a bit: we kept hanging out, and at one point, it seemed to me like maybe things could go somewhere. Or maybe I was just delusional. I asked her if she thought she’d moved on from her ex, and that’s when she told me she had actually been dating someone else for about a month. She said she’d kept it a secret because she didn’t want me to leave or feel hurt. I was upset for a few minutes but managed to pull myself together. I told her I understood and supported her, though I wished she’d been upfront about it.

One breakup later, she called me, and we hung out. I comforted her, and we stayed friends, but I was starting to feel emotionally drained. I didn’t know where this was going, but I kept holding it together for her because I wanted to be there for her.

Things settled back into normal, and I found myself thinking—again—that maybe this was going somewhere. Or, again, maybe I was just delusional. Then my friend called me to inform me that she’d been hooking up with someone else since her first breakup—the week when she had gotten distant from me. That stung, but what really hurt was who she had been seeing: a guy I knew to be a misogynist and an all-around toxic person.

At that point, I lost it. I felt completely used—like I was her emotional crutch when things went wrong in her relationships, but she kept me at arm’s length otherwise. I confronted her and told her I didn’t know if I could be her friend anymore. I didn’t handle it well—I let my emotions take over, and I’m not proud of how I acted.

I need to share the hardest part of this story, even though it’s painful to revisit. After my initial outburst, I spoke to her the next day. She explained that she had been hiding everything because she was ashamed she didn’t want me to see her as a “wh*re.” I told her I would never think that of her, but I also didn’t like being lied to. I invited her to lunch the next day and apologized for how I had acted earlier.

For a while, things felt like they might get better, but then she told me she “wasn’t comfortable hanging out with me alone.” Coming from someone who had once called me their best friend, that was devastating. It felt worse than any breakup I’d ever experienced. We started fighting constantly, and the pain became overwhelming. I couldn’t even look at her without feeling a lump in my throat or tears in my eyes. My anxiety, which was already bad, spiraled. Eventually, I was diagnosed with chronic anxiety and started medication, but at the time, I was barely holding myself together.

My therapist had suggested writing a letter and destroying it, but instead, I sent it to her. I don’t remember exactly what it said, only that I wanted her to know how much I cared and how hurt I was about losing her. I told her I had to fight back tears and look at the ground whenever I saw her. In hindsight, it may have come across as overly dramatic—maybe even as a veiled cry for help, though that wasn’t my intention. I wasn’t trying to guilt or hurt her; I just wanted to be honest about where I was. I’ve since learned that not every truth needs to be shared.

Months later, I heard something that shattered me. She revealed that she had been sexually assaulted by the same guy I’d heard she was hooking up with. She said she felt pressured and wasn’t given the option to say no. This lined up with what I knew about him—he had bragged to me once about how “hard” she had been to get with and even said she “didn’t want it to be real.” Hearing that, I had no doubts about her story, and even though we hadn’t spoken in months, I defended her to anyone who questioned her.

Learning about what happened to her broke me. I spiraled into a deep depression that lasted over a year. I cried for days, feeling a crushing guilt that I hadn’t done enough to protect her. One thing she said in her testimonial stuck with me: she mentioned feeling like she had no support, even though I’d been her friend at the time. I couldn’t stop blaming myself, thinking I should have been there more or done something to prevent it. Intellectually, I know it wasn’t my fault, but even now, I can’t completely shake the feeling that I failed her.

I tried to meet up with her several times to talk and make amends, but something always came up—either I had to cancel, or she did. When we finally set a time to meet, I showed up at her complex, but she started having what seemed like a panic attack over text. I tried to comfort her, but it only made things worse. Then she told me she “didn’t feel safe” around me.

Hearing that was like a dagger to the heart. I apologized and left, but those words have haunted me ever since. This was someone who once trusted me more than anyone, and now I was the source of her fear. I’ve never recovered from that moment. I stopped talking to everyone, withdrawing into isolation. I don’t want to risk making anyone feel unsafe, so I avoid interacting with people altogether.

Even though I know in my heart I’m not a predator, the idea that someone could see me as one keeps me from reaching out to anyone. I’ve been living in this self-imposed isolation for years now, terrified of how others might perceive me.

Edit: to be clear, not to paint her in a bad light, but to help people understand my perspective. She hadn’t “made it clear” that she wasn’t interested like I accidentally suggested earlier. It was more of a “hadn’t thought of it” and an “I’m not sure”. She could never tell me “no”, but I took it as a “no for now”. When I asked her about her feeling towards end of the friendship she said she didn’t know and couldn’t tell me, she said she wasn’t even sure what it meant to have romantic feelings vs a very strong bond. So she wasn’t sure. Not trying to make myself the victim, just explaining why I still had some hope throughout the friendship after she seemingly rejected me.","I was a “nice guy” and haven’t recovered to this day To the person who shared their “nice guy” moment: thank you for your courage and self-awareness.

19579,1fydmav,post,The story of my assault. TW: S/A discussion (If you're sensitive to this topic you shouldn't read this),"I know no one is going to believe this but Timothy Heller sexually assaulted me. I loved her music and had lots of merch. I discovered her in 2017 when she was in a band called ""Dresses."" I listened to her music everyday. For awhile I dreamt of going to one of her concerts and one day my mom got me tickets as a birthday gift. I was happy but we had to travel to see her perform. I had a fear of air planes but if I had to be on one to see my idol it was worth it. The concert was held at a place called Factory DTLA or something like that in Los Angeles, California. I believe it was sometime in January 2020 (pre-covid). At the time I was living in Texas so we went by plane. Anyways, when we made it to LA we got a hotel. I had so much fun and enjoyed her performance. Afterwords we were leaving and we saw Timothy leaving so I begged my mom to allow me to approach her and she said yes. Of course I was fan girling so hard so I asked for a photo. At the time I didn't have a phone so I took it with a Polaroid camera so I don't have the picture unfortunately. But I don't think that matters. Anyways, she asked if I wanted to come back with her to her hotel and hang out. I was 15 at the time so I asked my mom for permission. She was hesitant at first but since she was my idol so she said yes. My mom said she had to get things from the store so she said Timothy could take me home afterwords and I was happy. Anyways, Timothy gave me a ride to her hotel which was close to where we were staying but I had to be home before midnight and Timothy agreed. We played some board games and she had asked me if I had any interest in boys yet. I told her yes, and  I told her about my crush. After that things got weird because she told me if I wanted to get his attention I should show off my body. Specifically my chest area. I told her I didn't have revealing clothes and she said she could get some for me as long as I kept it a secret. Of course I agreed, she was my idol helping me out. Then she asked if I would ever get with a girl. At the time I didn't know about other sexual orientations. I only knew the word ""gay"" so I said I don't think my mom would approve. She said that it was normal to be with the same sex and she was an adult so I knew she was ""right."" After that she was asking if would kiss a girl if offered and I said ""I never kissed a girl before, so I dont know"" and she told me I could practice with her. That made me nervous so I asked what time it was but she brushed it off and kept being consistent about me kissing her to ""practice"" I said no, but she said if I wanted to impress the boy I liked that I should at least give it a try so I agreed. I kissed her quickly and pulled away but she grabbed my hand and pulled me closer to her body giving me little space to back up. She told me to try again but I said that I probably needed to get home. She said one more kiss and I she would take me home. Seeing how I didn't want to upset my mom or my idol at the time I gave in and complied. She then pulled me in and kissed me . It lasted only a couple of seconds but it felt like hours to me. She then took my shirt off and asked to touch my chest. I didn't even reply yet, she just went for it. I was so shocked at what was happening. It felt like just seconds ago I wanted to never leave the concert but now I wanted to get as far away from Timothy as possible. After constantly begging me to touch me I nodded and she put her hands up my skirt and started grabbing me and I started crying. I didn't want her to notice so I fought back the tears. After she was satisfied she drove back to my hotel and the whole car ride was complete silence. I sat there hoping it would be over soon and I could get away. When we arrived she told me she couldn't walk me to my room because she needed sleep so I walked up by myself. My mom was there and asked if I had a good time. I said yes and forced a smile. I didn't tell her because I thought she would get mad at me. I took a shower that night and scrubbed my lips and body. For 30 minutes I sat in the bottom of the shower crying and scrubbing. When I got out my mom was sleeping. She had got pizza for us to eat but I had no appetite so I took two pieces and shoved them to the bottom of the trash so she didn't suspect anything was wrong. After that night I fell into a deep depression and when I got home I put all of my merch in my closet and isolated myself. A month later my mom realized I was depressed. When she had asked what made me so hurt I told her I was getting bullied so she suggested therapy. I agreed but I never told anyone what happened. I was prescribed anti-depressents which made me overweight and I hated myself more. Ever since then I never felt better and I could still feel her hands on me. The way she took advantage of me and then abandoned me hurts so bad. How could someone I idolized my whole life do something like that to me? Although I'm doing much better I still get triggered easily. I'm telling my story now so I can let go of my past and so that anyone else who is struggling can know they are not alone. Sometimes I still try to convince myself that Timothy assaulted me as a way to deal with her own assault now that I know about it. But I feel like that doesn't make sense. I don't know why she did or even care why anymore I'm just happy I'm far away from her now. I apologize if it's hard to understand, my English ain't that good","The story of my assault.

19580,1c5sodh,post,I lied to my parents about applying for masters' programs and now its backfiring real bad (obviously),"Note: I know lying is bad but please hear me out

TRIGGER WARNING: anxiety, depression, sexual assault. 

So let's start from the beginning. To sum it up: I'm an Indian girl with brown parents who had high expectations of me while I grew up.  Since I was younger the seed was planted for me to become a doctor, and that's all I strived for. The only problem was that I was diagnosed with depression at 14, 10 years ago. But no one took it seriously, not me either. 

The only subject I enjoyed in school was biology and maths, so I was like sure, I can become a doctor. My first mistake was I wasn't good at chemistry so I couldn't apply for UK medical schools. I also sucked at studying without external help so that should have been a sign. Still, managed to get A\*AA in my A Levels. 

Things were all good until I transferred to UofT in 2020. Uh yeah, everything went downhill. I was doing a double major and a minor in life sciences, which sounds like ""oh you're so smart"" while saying it but I was struggling to say the least. Got really sick in 2021 while doing summer classes and MCAT prep, took months to recover and whoop back down again due to resurfacing sexual trauma. Basically, my mental health was splattered on the floor, I was so anxious I would burst into tears at anyone raising their voice in my vicinity, I could not meet any deadlines. 

I was desperately trying to salvage good grades without taking time off or another semester cause I was already a year ""late"". I genuinely was so burnt out I scraped the bottom of the barrel and graduated with a 2.0 GPA. Yeah, that's where I ended up. In 2023 I lied to my parents saying I applied for Masters' at UofT and said I just didn't get in. 

Went home from June to October 2023, my mental health declined even more due to my parents berating me (didn't know it was even possible?) and I took like 3-4 months to recover after coming back to Toronto. Mind you, I'm financially dependent on my parents. Have been applying for jobs but no luck as of yet.  

Uh but I repeated my mistake of telling my parents' that I applied for Masters. Again. This time all over Ontario and the US. But haha, my GPA and lack of work experience cause I was chasing med school led me nowhere. I was too scared so I didn't apply anywhere cause I won't get in anyway.

Fast forward April 2024, of course my father is asking questions. He doesn't believe I applied anywhere (accurately) but now I'm screwed cause he's asking for evidence that I applied. Please give advice, and if you're telling me to just say the truth at least tell me how.

Thanks, save me I'm pretty terrified. But I think telling the truth will also be freeing. I'm so exhausted. ","I lied to my parents about applying for masters' programs and now its backfiring real bad (obviously) Note: I know lying is bad but please hear me out

19581,1bz2e78,post,I grabbed a girls butt at a party when i was 16 and her reaction the next time i saw her was so weird,"So i was in first year of highschool, trying weed and loving it, first big parties, ect...
I was super shy and borderline crippled about girls, but still had friends. Got invited in a huge shisha party, and started to drink a lot. I ended up in the backyard (we were at least 20-25 there) talking with a group of friends. And that girl that i didn't know was super drunk like me. We were all from the same highschool i precise.we were standing next each other while in a circle of ppl talking. I just placed my hand on her ass for some fking reason. It felt wrong doing it but I couldn't help. She then raised her eyes to me, and then looked somewhere else like nothing happened. The worst is my hand stayed there for soo long it felt like several minutes. I cringed and felt horrible over that story for years, especially since some friends noticed. Anyway i saw her maybe a week later. The scene felt like some higher entity planed it. I was coming back in the highschool for class, and she was coming out. The entire front and inside court of the place was dead empty, not a bloody sound even if losts of ppl hang out there usually. She walked out on the front bridge as i engaged on the other end, she saw me, i looked at her and felt super bad, was awaiting disgust, hate or fear... But then she gave me a bright smile. We never met outside of the party, no common friend, so she can only remember me from the party. This is one of the most bizarre stuff i ever witnessed in my life.
I mean she probably just didn't care but damn that's some serious level of chillness

Edit : wow i didn't expect a storm of conflicting thoughts like that. I have written this fast, in a one shot idea, just because i discovered this sub, not thinking i could reach so many people. I would have definitely not have taken such a light tone if I had known. I want to say i know there is nothing right about it. Those who called me a creep are correct, i acted like a creep back then. I'm sorry about those of you who lived a sexual assault and might have been hurt reading this. I'm in no way saying that it was okay or anyone should do this. I was a frustrated and anxious kid and that led me to touch a girl without her consent. Alcohol is a big factor but doesn't excuse anything. Be sure of one thing though, i didn't only ""cringe"" at it, i hated myself and found myself disgusting. I never did anything like it again. Discovering sexual pulsion and alcohol at the same time as a boy is dangerous for girls. I understood how strong alcohol was and how bad the consequences of my actions could get if i let my pulsions be stronger than my values.
Now for clarity, the whole point of my post was the instant on the bridge. What i couldn't wrap my head around was the timing. She raised her head from her phone, saw me and instantly smiled. I don't know how she could have felt then, but i expected a first negative reaction, at least some fear or discomfort before she put up a defense mechanism...

I'm astounded at how some would kill me if they saw me rn, and some saw this as a potential start of romance or hookup.
I only wish peace to all of you, you don't do what i did, don't let others do it, and that you are confident enough to just try to seduce normally and not becoming a monster","I grabbed a girls butt at a party when i was 16 and her reaction the next time i saw her was so weird So i was in first year of highschool, trying weed and loving it, first big parties, ect...

19582,16nebzf,post,I touched multiple girls inappropriately when I was in middle school and early high school.,"For quick context, I(now 32M) had pretty difficult childhood. Large family, untreated Adhd, bullied and targeted by my own siblings my whole childhood, emotionally neglected, and ostracized. Knowing what I know now, I was clearly in severe need of mental health care and therapy as I clearly had reactive attachment disorder on top of the untreated adhd. My siblings locked me in the snow for hours, would attack me and harass me and then I would deal with the same things at an extremely small school (300 students Pre K - 12th). Even knowing what I know now I still lay in bed some nights so angry and ashamed of myself. When I was 15, I had no control of my anger or emotions and so people avoided me. Then, a group of guys started talking to me one day. They pointed out a girl in our class who was known for dating around. I don't know how they convinced me, but they convinced me to walk over and grab her butt. One of them did it first to ""show me it was okay""... so I did. She laughed it off and told me not to do it again... but the guys laughed and told me she ""was just saying that"".. so I did it again later, I don't know if I was looking for their attention or I was just so over sexualized and lonely, but it went on for so long, it happened so many times and she so clearly wasnt okay with it.. then one day in weight class the girl I had a crush on let one of the guys touch her breast for God knows what reason.. so impulsively I reached up and did the same.. but worst of all there was a group of siblings my parent babysat... one of them was not much younger than me, but in teen years even a year is considered a long time.. one day we were swimming and i was tossing them around the pool and wrestling and I realized I was getting ""excited""... I took advantage of the ""wrestling"". It was never under clothes, and it never went past touching... but to me that doesn't make it any less awful that I would do that. I just lay here some nights and these intrusive thoughts pop up like ""remember that time you just did these things to these girls?"" and I get so angry. I pray that she never realized I did that and that I didn't scar her because I was such an awful person.. but even still... anytime I feel like I'm doing good, and I've overcome my past... these memories haunt me and tear me back down...


Edit for clarifications sake and accountability: 
    So for starters. I think the main feedback I am seeing are the  comments about my adhd, other disorders, and the story of the guys. My intent was not to try and use those as ""fluff"" or a crutch.. I over communicate and have had posts on other subreddits taken down for being too long. So I didn't want that to happen and I obviously didn't explain my own perceptions to things properly. 
    My mental health issues are not my fault but they are my responsibility. The choices I made to assault these girls was still a choice I made to chase my own lustful desires and satisfaction with no consideration of them. The ""other guys"" encouraged me the 1st time it happened and with one girl. they did not play any part in it from then on except as witnesses and played no part in the other two girls I victimized... I think my state of mind was looking to it as a road map. Two things can be true at once, first that my life was difficult and thus there were many of Maslows hierarchy of needs that I did not recieve. Second that it does not excuse my behavior or justify it in anyway. But in my studies of psychology I've come across a common thread of seeking the ""purpose behind the behavior"". So I guess my quick typing without context came off as justifying, but that was not my intent nor my feelings on the matter.  

2nd. I want to apologize for not having the foresight to place a trigger warning for anyone else who has been victimized in the past or effected by actions such as this. It DOES NOT bring me any comfort to see other posts about how common this is. My hope for this post was not to hear other horror stories about this being a normal male behavior. I have been in therapy a few different times, however the times I have gone into therapy has felt directionless. Even still, therapist are trained to be unjudgmental, to remain impartial and unmoved. I posted this to get real, true responses. So thank you. 

To those who have offered words of support and understanding. Thank you for showing me that there are people out there who will understand that I strive everyday to get as far away from the person I was as I can. That I am not that person anymore and never will be again. This was what I needed, to know that others could see past who I was and understand that I despise who I was. That I could still be seen as a person by real people and not just a therapist in a chair being paid to convince me i am a person... 

To those who were critical and correcting. Thank you. I learned a while back the value of criticism. Having real people provide insight into these things helps to identify blind spots and mistakes.

To those who were raw. I appreciate your feedback. I understand there's nothing I can ever do to make it right. I can't take away the things that I did regardless of age or circumstances. I am not seeking any forgiveness or get out of jail free card. I am not try to manipulate people to coddle me or tell me what I did ""wasn't a big deal"" or ""normal"". I recognized my failures, my desire to be a better person is not dependent on anyone's forgiveness of ANY mistakes I've made past present or future. I want to be better because I recognized how horrible and disgusting the things I did was and how much hurt and trauma I could have (and as others pointed out) likely did cause. If someone is truly remorseful, they will change with or without forgiveness or acceptance, because it whats right. I can promise you that I will never be that person again, and I will continue doing everything I can to advocate against these behaviors.","I touched multiple girls inappropriately when I was in middle school and early high school. For quick context, I(now 32M) had pretty difficult childhood. Large family, untreated Adhd, bullied and targeted by my own siblings my whole childhood, emotionally neglected, and ostracized. Knowing what I know now, I was clearly in severe need of mental health care and therapy as I clearly had reactive attachment disorder on top of the untreated adhd. My siblings locked me in the snow for hours, would attack me and harass me and then I would deal with the same things at an extremely small school (300 students Pre K - 12th). Even knowing what I know now I still lay in bed some nights so angry and ashamed of myself. When I was 15, I had no control of my anger or emotions and so people avoided me. Then, a group of guys started talking to me one day. They pointed out a girl in our class who was known for dating around. I don't know how they convinced me, but they convinced me to walk over and grab her butt. One of them did it first to ""show me it was okay""... so I did. She laughed it off and told me not to do it again... but the guys laughed and told me she ""was just saying that"".. so I did it again later, I don't know if I was looking for their attention or I was just so over sexualized and lonely, but it went on for so long, it happened so many times and she so clearly wasnt okay with it.. then one day in weight class the girl I had a crush on let one of the guys touch her breast for God knows what reason.. so impulsively I reached up and did the same.. but worst of all there was a group of siblings my parent babysat... one of them was not much younger than me, but in teen years even a year is considered a long time.. one day we were swimming and i was tossing them around the pool and wrestling and I realized I was getting ""excited""... I took advantage of the ""wrestling"". It was never under clothes, and it never went past touching... but to me that doesn't make it any less awful that I would do that. I just lay here some nights and these intrusive thoughts pop up like ""remember that time you just did these things to these girls?"" and I get so angry. I pray that she never realized I did that and that I didn't scar her because I was such an awful person.. but even still... anytime I feel like I'm doing good, and I've overcome my past... these memories haunt me and tear me back down...

19583,158d3l5,post,I assaulted someone 8 years ago and it still haunts me,"8 years ago, right before I went off to college I sexually assaulted someone at a small get-together. 

In an effort to impress everyone there, I stupidly drank much more than I could handle. It was the summer right before I went off to college. I took swigs of heavy liquor to “impress” the people there. It was so stupid, I can’t even recognize myself when I think back to that memory. I drank so much I blacked out. In the morning after the drinking, I could and still only can remember vague recollections of what happened the previous night. I remember drinking heavily, I remember being at a parking lot for some reason? I remember walking down the hallway of the Airbnb that we were staying at, yelling random obscenities. I remember passing out in the bedroom, puking over and over while my friends helped me.

In the morning, I woke up not knowing at all what happened. I found out first through a friend who texted me asking if I remember what happened last night. He told me I forced a kiss on a girl in the group last night. I was frantic when I found it out, I asked the friends who helped me last night what happened. I got mixed stories, one told me I touched the girl last night, another told me I only kissed her. And yet another told me I was acting crazy and they needed to watch over me.

From the info I did get, I clearly assaulted this person. I remember I couldn’t even process the information when I found out. How could I have done something like that? I had always viewed myself as a good person, how could I have violated someone else like that to such a degree?  My first thought was suicide, I thought I ought to have killed myself for what I had done. I had violated someone else to largest extent you could, why would I deserve to live? I remember standing over the porch, thinking of how I could jump and probably die from the fall. But I couldn’t do it. I was too scared and too cowardly to just kill myself there.
 
I heard from my friends the rumors that spread. That I was a predator, that I was a horrible human being, that I needed to be taught a lesson. I felt these were valid, and I felt I couldn’t argue against such comments after what I had done. 


Regardless, nothing happened, I was never charged with anything, nothing was reported to my university, I had lost some friends, but the reality was nothing had actually happened to me. I went on with life, I had girlfriends, graduated college, and now work in a cushy job that I can’t help but feel like I don’t deserve. Every month though since the incident, it comes up once or twice, and I feel so ashamed and hateful of myself. Nothing like it has ever happened again, I’ve been much more watchful of my drinking, and I’ve gone to therapy to sort out my lack of understanding with consent and empathy. But I read stories on here of assault and of the stories of victims of these sorts of crimes, and I hate myself. I did this to someone. It doesn’t matter that I drank, it doesn’t matter that I blacked out. I did that, and I don’t think I can ever forgive myself. I’m confessing here to maybe get some sense of repentance? I don’t know. But thank you for reading, and I hope you all are having a wonderful day.","I assaulted someone 8 years ago and it still haunts me 8 years ago, right before I went off to college I sexually assaulted someone at a small get-together.

19585,mkfv9n,post,I've Been Assaulted and Assaulted Others at Various Parties,"(all of the names of people have been altered in this post to maintain privacy for everyone involved)

Over the years I've slowly been piecing together my drunken sexual experiences as a teen and I have realized some things that happened to me and some things that I did back to others. Alongside multiple instances where I was taken advantage of and assaulted by older girls in my school, there are two instances where I think I assaulted people. I feel abused and guilty.

In my sober state of mind, I have had no problems establishing many instances of consensual sexual acts. I value consent over everything else when it comes to any sexual acts in my life. I have been told by both of my girlfriends that I ask for *too* much consent. I would ask ""is this okay?"" at every step of a sexual experience for months into the relationships. I have done this for every sexual act I have conducted with anyone outside of a relationship setting as well. But there are 4 experiences in my life where someone was taken advantage of sexually. 1 of them I think I may be the abuser. 2 of them I was or was almost taken advantage of. 1 I’m not sure.

3 of these instances happened all in one night. In my mind I call it The Night I Wish Never Happened. I was 15 and at a party the night after my first kiss. I really liked the girl that the night previous had been my first kiss and had no intention of doing *anything* with any other girls this night. Most of the people at the party were in the grades above me and my friend Amber who went together. I drank a lot of alcohol that night and smoked a lot of weed. I made a complete fool of myself and no doubt ruined my reputation in the eyes of many of my peers. The combination of substances I was on was no doubt the reason so much of this night lies in a hazy fog in my memories, but over the years I have pieced it together.

&#x200B;

1. **Jackie.** The first instance is the most hazy for me. I was already drunk and was out in the detached garage smoking weed with some of the older kids. There was a girl in a grade older than me, Jackie, who was to my right in the smoke circle. Once my high was coming onto my already drunk mind she looked over at me and said. “I want to make-out with someone!” I didn’t know this girl and wasn’t even particularly attracted to her but I was very insecure and took the opportunity to do so and I said “me too!” She took me, stumbling, down to the basement of the party where there was a miniature room under the stairs and she shut the door behind us leaving us in complete darkness and she came onto me. I don’t know how to feel about this. On one hand I technically gave her explicit consent but in my country inebriated individuals can’t give consent; I can’t help but think she may have targeted me because I was younger and extremely under the influence. We began to make-out and I was so drunk and high I don’t remember most of it. I remember a lot of mouth action. I remember grabbing her chest. Then I remember touching her genitals through her jeans and receiving a protest in the form of a hand pushing me away. I think I may have tried to touch her in the same spot once more but I don’t remember. That haunts me. I may have violated her but all of the substances I had already consumed were taking over me and I can’t for the life of me remember.
2. **Jessica.** I don’t remember how Jackie and I’s relations in the closet went on for. I don’t remember how they ended either. The next thing I remember was chugging a peach Smirnoff I had stolen from someone’s bag in the kitchen of the party to chants from my classmates. I finished the drink, set aside the bottle and fell over. I was so drunk I felt like my clothes had turned to weighted blankets. I couldn’t stop laughing on the ground. I could hear people talking about me. Some laughing, some angry, some concerned. Someone took a video of me when I was on the floor and showed it to me months later and I was horrified. I didn’t look like myself. I eventually got up and talked with some people around the party for a while before I ended up talking with Jessica in the middle of the party. Jessica was a grade older than me as well. We had a couple mutual friends, and I remember seeing her around school. I don’t remember how we started talking or even what we talked about but I do remember her lunging herself at me and shoving her tongue down my throat. I was humiliated. In front of everybody once again I was being gawked at. I was defenceless though, she was bigger than me, and I was not in a mental state to think or protest. We ended up back in the same room under the stairs and the whole time I was thinking about how much I wanted to leave; How much this mindless mouth mashing wasn’t fun; How much I wanted to go back outside with my friends; How much I wished I hadn’t betrayed my First Kiss. After some indeterminate amount of time, my friend, Habib opened the door because he wanted to get his wallet. He didn’t know I was the one in the room and he was scared someone was going to steal money from him. I took the opportunity and left the room and Jessica behind. At this point I hadn’t processed anything so I wasn’t shaken or upset I was more so just overwhelmed. I wanted to get away from people so I went all the way to the top floor of the house where I didn’t think anyone would be.
3. **Megan**. When I got upstairs I had no time to collect my thoughts. There were 3 girls in the hallway between the rooms. I started talking to them. All 3 of them were in grades above me, one of them was even 2 years older. We began talking and they were very sexual to me. I started to come down slightly off the substances and I realized what I had done and what had happened to me this night so I made the mental decision to stop engaging in any more sexual activity that night. One of the girls from the group was more forward to me than the others. She told me her name was Megan. She began asking me if I wanted to “go talk with her in a another room.” I knew what that meant and I said no thanks. She insisted. I said no again. I was so drunk my head was spinning. She grabbed my arm and started dragging me towards a room; the whole time I was saying no and - because I was so drunk - weakly attempting to get away. I was powerless again. I wanted to cry. She eventually opened the door to the room she was about to drag me into and to my luck, there were already people in there making out and they told us to go away. I took the opportunity to leave. I was scared. I went outside and found Amber. I cried that night because I knew I had ruined my chances with my First Kiss who I was very into. And I knew some terrible things happened.
4. **Party Girl.** Fast forward 3 years. In between I had a small handful of sexual experiences including a girlfriend for 6 months. Although I was still a virgin. No bad sexual experiences happened whatsoever. I was freshly graduated from high school and not enrolled in university. It was around Halloween and some of my friends who *were* in university invited me to a frat party. I had never been to one and I was very interested. I was still friends with Amber and we went together once more. There were a handful of people I knew there from school but the house was mostly filled with 18-20 year olds that I had never met, and it was packed. In the basement of the house there was a dance floor with a bar. My friends told me the entrance fee covers you and you can have as many drinks as you want. They were serving punch with vodka I thought, but it was actually Everclear. I got the nearest to blackout drunk I have ever been without crossing the line. There was a lot of dancing and people in halloween costumes. Most of the night was filled with talking with my friends and reminiscing about younger grades we shared together. As the night went on I started to act dumber and dumber. I’ve seen videos of myself from this night as well and I don’t recognize that person. I was sticking my tongue out and my hair was completely disheveled. I lost most memories past this point. One of the only memories I have past this point is what makes me sick to my stomach. I remember being downstairs on the dark dance floor with the moving colours. I remember dancing. I remember a girl grinding on me. I remember touching her on her chest and over her pants once again and being protested once more. I think I stopped but I don’t remember. She turned around and began making out with me. I kissed her back. That is all I remember. What if I didn’t stop? What if I did it again? What if I left her with mistrust in men that is irreparable?

I’ve spent so many nights thinking and stressing about these events. I’ve cried for what happened to me; I’ve cried for what I’ve done. I’m scared my future career choices will be affected. I’m scared I may have negatively affected someone’s life. What happened with the 3 girls at the party when I was 15 has stayed with me for my whole life since. I had a hard time trusting girls for a long time. I don’t like being drunk around strangers anymore. Then I went and accidentally got drunk again and lost control. I’m scared I’m a menace. I sometimes watch a YouTube video where people are talking about sexual misconduct and I feel so sick. I feel triggered for myself and I feel guilty for what I might have done. 

I don’t know what to do or how to feel about any of this.","I've Been Assaulted and Assaulted Others at Various Parties (all of the names of people have been altered in this post to maintain privacy for everyone involved)

At this point I hadn’t processed anything so I wasn’t shaken or upset I was more so just overwhelmed. I wanted to get away from people so I went all the way to the top floor of the house where I didn’t think anyone would be.
3. **Megan**. When I got upstairs I had no time to collect my thoughts. There were 3 girls in the hallway between the rooms. I started talking to them. All 3 of them were in grades above me, one of them was even 2 years older. We began talking and they were very sexual to me. I started to come down slightly off the substances and I realized what I had done and what had happened to me this night so I made the mental decision to stop engaging in any more sexual activity that night. One of the girls from the group was more forward to me than the others. She told me her name was Megan. She began asking me if I wanted to “go talk with her in a another room.” I knew what that meant and I said no thanks. She insisted. I said no again. I was so drunk my head was spinning. She grabbed my arm and started dragging me towards a room; the whole time I was saying no and - because I was so drunk - weakly attempting to get away. I was powerless again. I wanted to cry. She eventually opened the door to the room she was about to drag me into and to my luck, there were already people in there making out and they told us to go away. I took the opportunity to leave. I was scared. I went outside and found Amber. I cried that night because I knew I had ruined my chances with my First Kiss who I was very into. And I knew some terrible things happened.
4. **Party Girl.** Fast forward 3 years. In between I had a small handful of sexual experiences including a girlfriend for 6 months. Although I was still a virgin. No bad sexual experiences happened whatsoever. I was freshly graduated from high school and not enrolled in university. It was around Halloween and some of my friends who *were* in university invited me to a frat party. I had never been to one and I was very interested. I was still friends with Amber and we went together once more. There were a handful of people I knew there from school but the house was mostly filled with 18-20 year olds that I had never met, and it was packed. In the basement of the house there was a dance floor with a bar. My friends told me the entrance fee covers you and you can have as many drinks as you want. They were serving punch with vodka I thought, but it was actually Everclear. I got the nearest to blackout drunk I have ever been without crossing the line. There was a lot of dancing and people in halloween costumes. Most of the night was filled with talking with my friends and reminiscing about younger grades we shared together. As the night went on I started to act dumber and dumber. I’ve seen videos of myself from this night as well and I don’t recognize that person. I was sticking my tongue out and my hair was completely disheveled. I lost most memories past this point. One of the only memories I have past this point is what makes me sick to my stomach. I remember being downstairs on the dark dance floor with the moving colours. I remember dancing. I remember a girl grinding on me. I remember touching her on her chest and over her pants once again and being protested once more. I think I stopped but I don’t remember. She turned around and began making out with me. I kissed her back. That is all I remember. What if I didn’t stop? What if I did it again? What if I left her with mistrust in men that is irreparable?

I’ve spent so many nights thinking and stressing about these events. I’ve cried for what happened to me; I’ve cried for what I’ve done. I’m scared my future career choices will be affected. I’m scared I may have negatively affected someone’s life. What happened with the 3 girls at the party when I was 15 has stayed with me for my whole life since. I had a hard time trusting girls for a long time. I don’t like being drunk around strangers anymore. Then I went and accidentally got drunk again and lost control. I’m scared I’m a menace. I sometimes watch a YouTube video where people are talking about sexual misconduct and I feel so sick. I feel triggered for myself and I feel guilty for what I might have done. 

I don’t know what to do or how to feel about any of this.",24,10.0,2021-04-05 8:29,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/mkfv9n/ive_been_assaulted_and_assaulted_others_at/,Neutral

So a long long time ago, I was at school and I had a group of friends that sat with me, and were in a club with me. They all were terrified of this kid, let's call them J, because they had previously sexually harrassed them/assaulted them. They told me and I was extremely angry, because my friends were all sweethearts and didn't deserve it. So, I hatched a plan in my mind.

Fast forward to a few days later, and we're there at the after school club. We're doing the activities and I on purposely sat in front of them. I believe the next thing was a complete accident, but some part of their body grazed my lower back/butt and I jumped up. They looked at me and I sat back down, but I waited until I got home, and I told my parents that J touched me. They called the school and were making sure I was okay (I was younger than 10 so I can't remember how I handled it).

The next day, I got called to the office and previous, I had told my friends that they touched me. They supported me and I told the office that J reached through the back of my seat and grabbed my butt. They took it very seriously and my other friends also spoke to the office because I asked if they wanted to share their stories.

All he got was a slap on the wrist from the school and an apology address to his victims and me. I continually feel awful about it but he did touch my other friends, so there's that.","I Lied To Get a Kid In My School In Trouble, But It Backfired Buckle in kiddos.

19588,fre0wi,post,I verbally abused and verbally assaulted 3 people a couple weeks ago.,"TLDR; I verbally assaulted people for being catholic and protecting an abuser. Theres backstory so it's long. TLDR-TLDR; I let my childhood trauma get the best of me and acted like a complete ass. 

I am sheltered in place in my grandmother's home in Texas as I write this. There's catholic trinkets and pictures everywhere and it reminded me of an incident when I was home in Pasadena California last month.  

I grew up around religion but it wasn't really forced on me. I always had a deep aversion towards religion and on some level toward religious people. I was a C&E catholic growing up, as we called it. (That's Christmas and Easter for the laymen). I was also baptized as a kid, I didn't know any better and it wasn't exactly an option. My mother's family was deeply religious and always preached to me as a kid and gave money to the church like clockwork. 

I had an extremely chaotic and abusive childhood, albeit never at the hands of a religious person. I was raised by my mother who wasn't at all religious except as it pertained to drinking and drugs. She was violently bipolar and I was subjected to unspeakable horrors as a child. I was neglected to the point of being hungry for days on end while my mother disappeared and hit, punched, kicked etc.  I developed pretty severe OCD as a result of this. I was also molested by a neighbor as a young boy; that situation and the shit I endured at the hands of my mother was more than enough to convince me there was no god.

 I grew angrier and angrier at the rest of my family who claimed christianity, but did nothing to help me when they knew the things that went on. They never once tried to help me or my sister and on one occasion when I was away at my grandmother's house CPS removed my sister from the home. My mother's family was called as they were the closest relatives and asked if they could take my sister temporarily so that she didn't go into foster care. They declined and my sister went into foster system. To make things worse, it would have been very temporarily just until her dad could get her. Not long term. 

I came back and my sister was gone. I ended up leaving shortly thereafter to live with my best friend and his family. I'm so grateful for then as they took me in from 14-18. If not for them who know what would have happened to me. Anyways I got heavily into drugs. I was young and dumb. I ruined my life. I spent 5 years in prison and went to rehab a million times. I've been homeless and strung out on drugs blah blah blah. My life was truly awful until I was 27. I got sober and became very successful blah blah blah. 

Now I know I didn't capture the whole story but you get the idea. My very catholic, christ loving, money donating family never once tried to help my sister and I. On top of all that they judged the shit out of me because of the way my life turned out. Now listen I made my choices but honestly I just did what I could to get by.

 So I basically have a ton of resentment toward religion, abusers, and judgemental folks. But I _always mind my own fucking business_. I'm not some edgelord who wants to debate religion or shit on people for being religious. Just don't force it on me and I'm good. 

Now for the story: 

I was sitting outside a small cafe in Pasadena drawing and having a coffee. 3 people came and sat at the table next to mine. It was an omder woman (OW), a middle aged man (MM), and a 30 something woman with a Karen haircut (K) 

They all worked at a catholic K-12 school and their conversation went something like this:

OW: ""I cant believe this. I just don't know how to feel. Do you think they're lying?""

K: ""I don't know but it's really testing my faith. And I'm worried because all 3 of my kids go to school there. But I've seen him be abusive toward a few parents before. He's not the nicest priest I've ever met.""

MM: ""mhm, mhm"" 

OW: ""I know he was _accused_ of the one thing from a long time ago, I think thirty years or something, but I know he was cleared"" 

MM: ""mmmmhm""

K: ""I don't know. It just scares me because he is around my kids. I've seen him grab other kids at school pretty hard. I saw him pull one kid by the collar of his shirt. A lot of other kid's parents have made complaints on him before. And now this and the archdiocese is involved. Theres an investigation.  It's just really testing my faith"" (she said this thing about testing her faith about 5 times in the entire exchange)

MM: ""hmmmm yeah wow"" 

OW: ""Well, I've never seen him be anything but stern. He's a tough priest, but I think maybe they're lying. Why would he do something like that?"" 

K: ""He's been at the school a long time. I don't think he should be fired unless theres any proof he did what they said. In sure the investigation will be thoroughly done. I mean the archdiocese is involved now. It's just my kids I worry about you know?"" 

MM: ""Yeah. Mhm, yeah"" 

At this point I've been listening to them go back and forth with this shit for about 10 minutes. I was extremely upset. I was getting that shaky feeling and like just had really bad anxiety. I started to think of something clever to say and I was just growing angrier so I thought of a couple sentences to say and practiced it in my head for a few minutes so I would get it right. I know that sounds stupid but my OCD is like that. I wanted to say certain things and I knew I was angry so I tried to reiterate in my mind what I wanted to convey so that way when I finally said something it wouldn't be ""fuck you all"" and I'd spend every shower I took for the rest of my life regretting it. 

(Now, I  don't know if the accusations were sexual or physical abuse or whatever but of course I assume the worst, after it's a catholic church school they were discussing) 

I stood up and put all my drawing stuff back in my bag. I walked over to the table and spoke:

""You all should be absolutely ashamed of yourselves. You're sitting here having a conversation that is literally trying to defend an abuser. It's fucking disgusting. It's bad enough that every time you do anything to support the church, you're supporting an institution that systematically abuses children and then covers it up, but here you all are actually trying to protect a fucking abuser. You especially lady! (I pointed at the Karen lady who was the mom) you said about a hundred times this is testing your faith, well it fucking should. If you love your kids you'll take then out of that school and out of that church. What the fuck is wrong with you? You're all fucking disgusting and you should all be ashamed of yourselves and ashamed of the school you work at. I cant believe what in hearing."" 

This isn't verbatem of course but it's close. That was it. I walked away and headed home. I only bow started to feel a bit guilty when I came to my grandmother's house and saw all the jesus stuff. Not that I think I was wrong but I shouldn't have verbally abused those people. I probably shouldn't have said anything at all but if I had to say something I should have done it more maturely. It was a stupid thing to do and I definitely didn't have any positive impact on the situation and I let my feelings and emotions get the best of me. I doubt any of those people are redditors but if they are, I'm sorry.","I verbally abused and verbally assaulted 3 people a couple weeks ago.

19589,eiehns,post,I lied to the police to protect someone who hurt me,"TW: Sexual assault

This has all been pretty recent so I really feel like I need to get it off my chest. I also apologise for the formatting, I’m on mobile.

I was sexually assaulted, no other way I can say it really without completely breaking down.  I thankfully can’t remember everything that happened but I have enough clear recollection to say it was more horrible than I have words for.


The official story:

It happened when I was out with my company for a celebration. A few of us decided to keep the party going, there were some of my work friends and a few other coworkers. I have had confirmation via blood work that someone put something in my drink during this time.

I don’t remember anything until the assault happened (which yet again is not a complete recollection) and when I became completely lucid after the assault occurred when I was able to move and seek help. I have no idea who assaulted me, what they looked like (I have glasses which were taken off for most of it) or what they sounded like. At the moment, the police are frustrated because they might be looking for someone who doesn’t exist and I’ve refused to make an official statement. They can’t even do anything until I make a statement.


The truth: 

I know exactly who it was who did this too me. One of the people I was with was a coworker we’ll call J. J is a mid-high level manager in my company. He saw I wasn’t feeling well and we caught a cab together. The plan was to drop me off at a main street near where I live and for him to continue back to his place as we lived in the same direction. 

That didn’t happen. I couldn’t tell you how or why it changed, but it did. J was the person who did that to me, and left me passed out in an alley.


Now there’ll be a lot of people most likely confused about why I haven’t told the police if I know who did and why I haven’t made a statement. Honestly, I don’t even have a good answer for you. My official reason, and this is also the truth, is I currently don’t think I could go through the process. The second, unknown reason, is J is a manger in the area I want to get a position in soon. I thankfully wouldn’t ever see him, aside from the odd occasion, but he’s very well regarded in the team and friends with a fair number of the people there. As well potentially missing out on working the area I’ve worked so hard to get into, I’ve not been in my company long and I’m afraid of what might happen if my company found out. It’s a good place but I couldn’t deal with this following me around, not to mention the difference in level and power between me and J. The thing I’m most concerned about though, is people not believing me, especially the friends I have who work/have worked for him.

And that’s it. For all who have gone through a similar experience, I am so sorry. I never realized how hard it is to live with.","I lied to the police to protect someone who hurt me TW: Sexual assault

19591,df0m9f,post,I haven’t went to any of my college classes or done any of the work for them since the start of the semester but I’ve been telling my parents I have.,"This is my first year at school and I thought that I could do it but I just kept ignoring all my schedules and have stayed home in my apartment almost every day and only go out at night. Mostly it is because I am extremely mentally ill now, I think more of psychosis than depression. But I can’t tell my parents why I am like that because I would have to do an insane amount of explaining. 


I am wasting my money and everyone else’s time but I can’t seem to get it together. I had insanely good grades in highschool too and I feel like this would be far to unexpected for my parents to believe without any further explanations. 

I’m thinking about dropping out but I’d have to find another place to live because they only let students live in my place so I would have to sublet to another student. I have like one “boyfriend” from high school I could stay with at his other house he has near my school but I don’t know if this would make my life better or worse. 

I feel like an absolute let down and like I just wasted one of the biggest priveleges and opportunities in life.

Edit: I really appreciate all the response but I feel like I’ve misconstrued some things. I am not stressed about the actual schoolwork i actually took a summer semester and I did very well and got mostly 90s. I don’t want to sound arrogant but my problem is more my mental health, I am dealing with issues of sexual assault and old relationships etc. I really do appreciate all the motivation and advice :)","I haven’t went to any of my college classes or done any of the work for them since the start of the semester but I’ve been telling my parents I have.

19592,cls5bk,post,i sexually assaulted a classmate 5 years ago,"i don’t remember much about the incident itself, barely anything at all. we were both 20 at the time, in our first year of college. she came to my room to make out and i went farther than she agreed to. she didn’t say much, probably out of anxiety, and i took it as consent when i should have taken it as a lack thereof. i didn’t forcibly penetrate her, but i was on top of her grinding and kissing which is not much better. we talked a few times afterward, albeit never about what happened, and i forgot about the whole thing. 

when i heard rumors about myself sexually assaulting someone, i figured a guy who had bullied and lied about me previously was spreading them and so i lashed out at people who were talking about it (including her, she brought it up in third person to see how i would react). when i put the pieces together i panicked and repeatedly asked her if it was her (which is an incredibly shitty thing to do to a victim, especially after denying it, but i was so scared at that point i wasn’t thinking straight).

i lost most of my friendships, and i can’t blame anyone for that. even my brother mostly stopped talking to me after he found out. i dropped out of college soon after and moved back in with my parents, who continue to unhelpfully insist to me that the classmate i assaulted was crazy or exaggerating.

i’ve tried to kill myself twice since then, once that year and once two years afterward. due to the depression, i haven’t been able to leave the house much or hold down a job for more than a couple of weeks. things got a little better when i volunteered for an immigrant’s rights group, but someone from my school recognized me at an event and i was no longer welcome.

i don’t really talk to anyone or do much anymore, i’ve just been a leech on my parents. i’ve started drinking a lot to cope, and i’ve blown through all of my savings doing so. i’m thinking of trying to kill myself again, since i don’t know what’s even left for me in life and i don’t think i deserve to live anyway.","i sexually assaulted a classmate 5 years ago i don’t remember much about the incident itself, barely anything at all. we were both 20 at the time, in our first year of college. she came to my room to make out and i went farther than she agreed to. she didn’t say much, probably out of anxiety, and i took it as consent when i should have taken it as a lack thereof. i didn’t forcibly penetrate her, but i was on top of her grinding and kissing which is not much better. we talked a few times afterward, albeit never about what happened, and i forgot about the whole thing.

19593,ccz4go,post,I sexually assaulted my friend last night after we got drunk,"I'm really rattled by it and I'm confused and upset by what happened. We were both at our friend's house celebrating his 21st birthday. I drank a little too much but I'm fairly confident I remember everything that happened. My friend seemed fine for the most part, but again I was impaired so I don't know for sure how he was but he was definitely intoxicated. 

&#x200B;

All in all we ended up sleeping in the same bed together when the night ended, still intoxicated. I remember waking up sporadically throughout the night and I was cuddling him and touching him from what I know. Then something came over me, I don't know what it was. The dominate conversation the whole night between our friend group was intimacy, maybe I was lonely because of that. Or turned on. Or what I don't even know, maybe I just wanted to feel powerful. But I ended up reaching into his pants. I think he resisted it as best he could, I don't know how he reacted at all. 

&#x200B;

I'm completely disgusted with myself. I don't know what came over me. He didn't mention anything this morning when we woke up, he said he didn't remember us cuddling but I don't know how he wouldn't have woken up with what was happening. I hope he doesn't have any idea what happened. If he does I hope he wasn't damaged. I don't want to have hurt my friend.","I sexually assaulted my friend last night after we got drunk I'm really rattled by it and I'm confused and upset by what happened.

19594,c45nqr,post,I racially profiled a patient,"I want to preface this by saying I am so ashamed of this incident, and it makes me hate myself every time I think about it. 

I'm a white female nursing student, and last year I was on a placement in a day procedure ward. I had new a patient come in who happened to be a black man. As soon as I entered his cubicle to take down his details and explain the side effects of the anaesthetic he would be receiving, I got a bad feeling and immediately thought, ""Don't get too close because he'll try and feel you up."" This gentleman was very smiley and chatty with me, which increased my bad feeling about him. I was talking to him about the procedure for about twenty minutes, and then we talked about his kids for about ten minutes, during which he was wheeled into the theatre. After his procedure I was put on recovery so I was there when he woke up, and I got him a sandwich and a cup of tea before he went home. At no point whatsoever during my interaction with him did he behave inappropriately at all. During my tea break I thought about the whole experience, and whether I would have reacted the same way if he was a white man. I am certain that the fact that he was black was what made me feel uncomfortable. I feel so disgusted with myself and how I reacted to the whole thing, and the bottom line is that he was a lovely patient, and because he was black I assumed he'd sexually assault me. I'm not looking for people to tell me this is okay, because it is not in any way okay. The best I can do is learn from this and try to bear it in mind the next time I have a patient who isn't white.

White people: sure, like you've never subconsciously racially profiled someone in your life. It's ingrained in us, taught before we even realise.

Non white people: I'm really sorry, and please know that I'm doing everything to identify and  change this.","I racially profiled a patient I want to preface this by saying I am so ashamed of this incident, and it makes me hate myself every time I think about it.

19595,c2i2d5,post,"Risky behaviour causes major scare, but I don’t seem to be able to stop","I’ve been sleeping around since 7-8 years. Either Tinder/Bumble dates or escorts. I have a high sex drive but wifey has zero. I don’t blame her, its partially due to strict Christian upbringing equating sex to a sin and also vaginusmis (maybe I’ve spelt it wrong) due to which she doesn’t enjoy it. We have a kid, which was conceived through IUI. Cant tell her or discuss this mainly because of her religious beliefs.

I’ve slowed down (no of sexual encounters) considerably since last few years but I have also gotten bolder. I’ve had unprotected intercourse a few times, both with FWB as well as escorts. Each time it has been a well thought decision based on my assessment of the partner but i could be wrong. There hasn’t been untoward incident yet and i keep it very discreet. My wife doesn’t know.

Now is the problem. Recently when I met a escort and she blew me she refused because blood touched her lips. It has never happened before and totally fucked me up. I went to a doc who checked and found some growths which even protruded from the urethral opening. I consulted a specialist who suggest removing them. A surgery was planned and a cystoscopy was also performed. Nothing inside the urethra but the growths were removed by the doc. He said they looked like warts. Asked him to avoid that word in front of wifey and he agreed. He addressed it as lesions and told her while its not common in that area of urethra, its not uncommon either. He said we will know the nature of the growth only after the lab reports come back but he mentioned to me privately that he was 99% certain it was warts.

Now while I wait for the reports I’m confused. If its warts and report mentions HPV ill have to find a way of making sure wifey doesn’t know. If its not warts but rather something cancerous, that’s even more fucked up. Apart from this I’m in very good shape and regularly exercise.

While lying in the hospital bed I had a sense of realisation of how I’m putting my family at risk. Not infection but if anything happens to me they will suffer. But now that im back home, I’ve started checking profiles on Bumble and Tinder again and don’t know how to stop. I’ve though made a resolution ill never have unprotected sex and never see an escort. But somewhere inside i feel even the Bumble/Tinder is bad and I should stop. I think I’m addicted to sex and don’t know how to stop. An example is how I had such a strong urge today that I masturbated (very gently though by just rubbing my head) but still had bloody cum. It relieved me but the blood was scary.

In the hospital every time my wife was showing concern and taking amazing care of me, on my kind was playing a thought that if she finds out that its probably an STD she would divorce me and would probably be assaulting me, instead of such kindness.

This is both a confession as well as a cry for help to get out of this which is affecting both my personal life and job. I’m an otherwise very high achiever but I feel I do get distracted by pretty women and the sex on my head.

I’m sure there have been others probably in my situation so please help me before I ruin myself completely.","Risky behaviour causes major scare, but I don’t seem to be able to stop I’ve been sleeping around since 7-8 years.

19596,bwzgxk,post,I sexually assaulted someone and I don't know how to feel,"When I was fifteen, I had a friend who was sixteen over quite often. After realizing one day that I was attracted to him I made several attempts to be physically close to him and he sometimes reciprocated, for example, I would sit down on the couch and he would put his legs under me before I sat down. One time I moved my leg between his and kept it there and when I said I had to leave he said he didn't want me to leave. Sometimes he would move away but sometimes he would reciprocate and try to touch me a lot. He sometimes got erections when looking at me but it wouldn't lead anywhere. Well after this kind of noncommittal touching/looks I decided one night to reach my hand down his pants. I didn't jerk him off but I just felt his ass. I honestly don't know what the fuck I was thinking. After this happened for about twenty minutes he asked me to stop and I did. I made a dumb excuse that I was asleep and just tried to pretend like it was an accident. We both never talked to each other about our physical closeness or if we had any feelings for each other and this whole thing lasted over six months. Also one night while we were sleeping next to each other, he got close to me and he put his waist next to mine and started moaning. 

&#x200B;

Anyways the other day I was driving with him in the car and he brought it up how I put my hand down his pants. Apparently he told my brother and said to my brother he thought he was raped. At that point I kind of froze and realized that maybe I was grossly misreading the signs he was giving me. I honestly thought that if he didn't move away when we got close he liked me and that it was okay. I just thought we were into each other and we were too scared to actually admit it to each other. He didn't move my hand immediately when I put it down his pants and I honestly just thought nothing of the whole situation for years. I thought the whole thing was mutual and wish that if he really was not interested then he could have just told me out right. I don't know why he would sometimes reciprocate, I honestly just thought we had something between us. I feel really fucking stupid for acting the way I did when I was fifteen. I'm wondering if in his mind I was frequently making him uncomfortable and crossing serious boundaries. In my mind I just thought we were messing around. I know now that consent needs to be spoken. Honestly I feel so fucking terrible about all of this and I am wondering if I am just a monster. Not only that I am considering jumping off a building sometime soon.","I sexually assaulted someone and I don't know how to feel When I was fifteen, I had a friend who was sixteen over quite often.

19597,bucorh,post,I sexually assaulted a friend years ago and I feel absolutely awful,"A couple of years ago, during my freshman year of college, I was romantically engaged with this girl. I really did like her but I treated her awfully. We started out as friends and we clicked really strongly, and hung out all the time between classes, went on dates together, and generally hung out together a lot while smoking cigarettes on a bench on our school campus. There was obvious sexual tension between us and we would often kiss each other and cuddle a lot. She was in a bad relationship at the time and she left him for me. But we never actually officially dated. On one of the school breaks I invited her over to my house, over an hour away. We had an awesome date and she came to my place, and I for some reason fingered her, I never asked for her consent, and I have no idea what came over me or why I did that, I guess I was just a horny dumb idiot kid who thought this was a good idea. I invited her over to my house, and totally betrayed her trust and her emotions.I n the days and weeks afterwards I apologized, and since then we've obviously never been the same. We hung out on the campus before a couple of times and we've had classes together before and she even gave me a house warming present when I moved into my new apartment she's been nice to me, and whenever I say I'm sorry for how I treated her in the past she says that I'm fine. But I can't forgive myself. And I don't think I ever will. Since then I've had my own relationships and she's had her own and we've obviously grown apart due to college and classes and stuff but I hate knowing that there's this side to me that can and will hurt others. I'm currently seeking out therapy but I'm worried I won't be able to afford it. I know I hurt her really badly, and I don't know why I hurt someone I loved so much. 

I'm currently looking for therapy and counseling, and ways to get help for this, because the guilt I feel has lead me to isolate myself from a lot of my friends and I don't know what to do.

19598,bu6jsx,post,I sexually assaulted my best friend while we were drunk and I can’t live with myself (update),"[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/bt1m5l/i_sexually_assaulted_my_best_friend_while_we_were/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app) is a link to my old post. She eventually responded to my texts a few times over the last few days. She thinks that I had planned the whole thing, and that I wasn’t even drunk when it happened. I know that’s not true, and I’ve told her that. She eventually stopped responding to me, but today is the first day back in school from the weekend. I have a class with her, when I saw her in person and asked if she wanted to talk she said no. She barely even makes Eye contact, and I texted her saying “do you want to talk in general”, and she didn’t respond but I know she saw it. I think she hates me. I can’t imagine suddenly not being friends with her after 3 and a half years of being super close. It’s so awful and I still hate myself so much.

She eventually responded to my texts a few times over the last few days. She thinks that I had planned the whole thing, and that I wasn’t even drunk when it happened. I know that’s not true, and I’ve told her that. She eventually stopped responding to me, but today is the first day back in school from the weekend. I have a class with her, when I saw her in person and asked if she wanted to talk she said no.

19599,btu68h,post,I used to go ~2 days without eating or drinking anything,"Short version: Once my two oldest siblings moved out, I got a room to myself (albeit only large enough for a bed and a small desk). I'd stay in that room for days, often only leaving the room once a day, quickly, to use the bathroom (I guess I didn't have to urinate that often because I was chronically dehydrated at that point). I'd get so dehydrated that drinking would hurt enough to cause my eyes to water. I'd just stay in that room for as long as possible, either sleeping, laying in bed depressed/struggling with my thoughts, or reading a book. This continued from when I was ~12 to when I was ~15, when I had to go to school. It might be part of the reason I have a lot of health issues now (hormones, tachycardia, fatigue, among others).

Longer version:

I've always been told I'm a very forgettable person. Teachers would forget to grade my work; family would forget to, for example, tell me dinner was ready; I'm told that when I was a baby, my mother forgot about me for an entire day because I was quiet; my whole family has, on two occasions, forgotten my birthday, despite it being 4 days after one of my brothers'; my parents forgot to buy me new shoes, so I was stuck wearing the same ones for 2.5 years (until they literally fell apart); the few friends I've made have forgotten to get back to me/message me about stuff; my best friend forgot my birthday this year. Stuff like that. 

I was homeschooled. While this wasn't the stereotypical ""no school""ing, it also wasn't healthy. Because we lived in a bad neighborhood, we weren't allowed to go outside (my mom was a stay-at-home mom, so I don't know why, in retrospect, she couldn't just watch over us, but whatever). Our closest relatives lived over an hour away. Because of this, we spent ~8 hours a week outside of the house, and less interacting with people other than immediate family.

My siblings always took priority. When they finished a workbook or a difficult lesson, they'd be praised and rewarded. Meanwhile I was required to do the same level of work (same grade) as my brother 3 years older than me (except in math, in which I was a year ""behind""), and my accomplishments were met with a dismissive, ""good job, now do the next one."" We held extravagant (for us, being very poor) parties for my siblings upon their completion of high school (meaning, a get-together with some relatives, an expensive meal and lots of dessert); when I finished high school, my mother said, ""but you don't _really_ want a party, do you?"" If I had a fight or argument with one of my siblings, I was always the ""bad guy"" and often labeled a liar, regardless of what the evidence (cuts and bruises, broken toys, etc.) said. When my siblings were ""done"" with a toy, it was put away or given away, didn't matter if I still wanted it.

I was, quite frankly, abused. I have a phobia of cockroaches, which my father decided was ridiculous, so he forced me to pick up a cockroach every day for years. If I refused, escalating punishments (usually whippings) were used until I complied. He also screamed at us, threw things, broke things, etc. and his favorite form of ""discipline"" was whippings. My mother told me repeatedly growing up that I was horrible and I was going to be a terrible person when I grew up. When I was around 6, my sister began molesting me. As a family, we had a brief amount of ""family time"" almost every evening where we'd sit down together and watch TV for an hour (until our TV broke, I don't remember how old I was, and we didn't get a new one for 3-4 years). She would make me sit down beside her, cover us in a blanket no matter the temperature outside, and touch me for most if not the entire duration of the session. I honestly have no clue how nobody caught on. I knew it was bad and wrong, but I also knew that if I spoke up I'd be labeled a liar and probably be treated even worse for saying something so terrible. After the TV broke, she would shut me in our room and play ""games"" with me. She moved away to college when I was 12, but the sexual contact continued every time she visited until she got married (when I was 15-16). To be perfectly honest, I'm not 100% on the ages here because until the year before last, I had blocked everything up until I was 16 from my memory; growing up I couldn't remember the past except in brief flashes, I guess because I was living day-to-day to escape the trauma (it all hit me at once when something traumatic happened the year before last, just before my 18th birthday). It's still extremely difficult to remember specific events outside of my flashbacks, though I know general stuff (like in the above paragraph).

As soon as my sister and oldest brother moved away, I isolated myself in now-my room. Aside from quick ventures to the bathroom, generally once a day, I'd just lay in bed sleeping, trying to control my thoughts/depression, and reading books. I completely stopped doing school work, and wouldn't even leave the room to get something to eat or drink unless forced. I only stopped when I was 15 because I had to leave my room to go to my college classes, at which point my mother started checking in to make sure I was keeping myself healthy enough to be seen.

I've been diagnosed with severe depression, psychotic depression, bipolar, general anxiety, and social anxiety (who'd've thought I wouldn't be well adjusted to socialize, since I got a _whole 8 hours_ a week around other people?... and maybe an hour of that was spent talking to non-relatives). I'm on antipsychotics now because without them I hallucinate (visual, audible, and tactile), and because they make it hard to think about anything so I won't obsess over assaulting and possibly killing my sister, then killing myself (and honestly, if I had seen her while I was off my antipsychotics and I was in that state, 100% I would've attempted it, and I can't say I would've regretted succeeding). I am in therapy, and the therapist approves of the antipsychotic use for that purpose because my thoughts and feelings are ""disgusting"" and ""disturbing"" and several other things.

Sorry for the rant, I just really needed to talk about this. But yeah, my confession: for 2-3 years I'd isolate myself in my room for up to ~2 days at a time without talking to anyone or eating or drinking anything. I don't know how I survived only eating a few of times a week and averaging maybe 1/2 a cup to 1 cup of water a day, honestly. I'm sure my religious family would call it a ""miracle"" of ""God"" if they knew.","I used to go ~2 days without eating or drinking anything Short version: Once my two oldest siblings moved out, I got a room to myself (albeit only large enough for a bed and a small desk).

19600,bt1m5l,post,I sexually assaulted my best friend while we were drunk and I don’t know how to live with myself,"We’ve been best friends for 3 and a half years. We’re both in high school, and about a week ago she came to me asking if we could drink together, because she never had before. We did, and it was a really fun time. After a while we started to cuddle, something we’ve never done before. It was consensual I know because we were talking about it and asking if it was okay. While we were both trying to fall asleep though is when it happened. I don’t know why I did this, I would never even think to if I was sober. I put my hand on her boob and on her butt. When she noticed she got out of the bed and started to walk home. It was 1 am. I couldn’t get her to stay. She made it home okay, we don’t live that far apart. I don’t know how to live with myself after this. I betrayed her trust, she felt safe with me her first time drinking and I ruined it. I’ve never done anything like this before, I always look down on people that sexually harass others like this. I’ve texted her, but she’s completely ghosted me. All I want to do is to make things right, I was barely even thinking about what I was doing in the moment, and I regret it with every inch of my soul. I can’t image the pain it causes her, and I hate myself so much for what I did. Should I give her space to heal? I really just want to talk to her, to know how she’s feeling. What do I do? How do I make things right? Will this feeling of guilt and self hatred ever go away?","I sexually assaulted my best friend while we were drunk and I don’t know how to live with myself We’ve been best friends for 3 and a half years.

19601,bqqg4k,post,I assaulted my younger brother,"When I was a child (7 or 8)  my cousin two years older than me taught me how to masturbate. She touched me and kissed me and from there I developed a sick addiction where I'd do it 20 times a day and feeling disgusted with myself would hit myself and call myself stupid.

She convinced me to dance seductively in front of my brother and tried to get me to touch my younger cousin inappropriately and to act as a lookout while she tried to touch other cousins .

I remember kissing a girl that I was on a play date with and I remember trying to kiss another girl while at childcare but I got caught by teachers.

Once her father walked in on us touching each other in her bed. I got sent home and got a whopping.  Her dad thinks I initiated, that I was the bad seed but he had no idea.

One night I made my brother go into a closet while I laid on top of him. I don't remember kissing him or touching him or anything. Maybe I would have but thank goodness he ran out of the closet and told mom that I tried to have sex with him. I lied and said no I didnt. Mom was pissed and yelled at him for lying about something so wrong.

I never ever forgot this so he has to remember but he never bought it up. I don't talk to my cousin either. I see her once in a blue moon if I decide to go to family gatherings.  As you get older these memories come back or get clearer. I'm waiting for the day for him to bring it up. It hasn't happen yet. He's pursuing a career in entertainment (I am kind of too). What if he makes it big and speaks about that incident?  I'd  feel so much shame. I'd be ruined. 

Lesbian relationships bother me, disturb me, make me a bit upset and the only reason I can think of this is because what happened between my female cousin. 

I have a daughter and I held her back from attending sleepovers with friends and family because I was afraid she'd get touched too. 

I guess you can say I sexually assaulted my brother. This thought comes into my mind once in awhile and I think to myself what a monster I was. What if he didn't run out of the closet? Then I think of my cousin and I have disdain. She not only gave me my first sexual experiences but she was a bit cruel to me in other ways.

I looked up to her and only wanted her to like me.

Feels better getting this off my chest. Any thoughts on what I can do about this?","I assaulted my younger brother When I was a child (7 or 8)  my cousin two years older than me taught me how to masturbate.

19602,bjqvj2,post,I Wish I had been a bigger asshole to my psychotic roommate,"Throw away bc I'm lowkey still afraid of this psychopath. I don't know how much detail to give since we lived together for two years and so many things happened. Let's call my roommate Jackie. Jackie and I went to HS together and were best friends, we went to diff universities for 2 years before transferring to the same school and becoming roommates off-campus. We even switched to the same major! 

&#x200B;

Our lease started at the beginning of summer but we didn't move in until August and Jackie had gotten a bf over the summer. This bf had been at this school for 2 years with his own social circle and since we were new, we hung out with them. I realized kind of quickly they just weren't my type of people- very sexist, rude, obnoxious, and immature, so I sort of steered clear of them and found my own friends and hobbies on campus. Jackie constantly hung out with these guys though, but we also still hung out one on one at our apartment and had dinner/went shopping together. 

&#x200B;

Winter break passes, she stops talking to me. Avoids me, doesn't say hello when she sees me. After half a semester of this I try just asking her whats up when I see her. She responds normally.. and I soon realize she won't talk to me unless I talk to her. It was one-sided but I wanted to be civil and I didn't know what her deal was. The semester ends in early May and we both realize we signed up for physics courses of the summer in the same class and she starts being INCREDIBLY social and nice to me. I soon found out it was because she wanted to copy my HW and cheat from my exams. I said no, she failed the first exam and dropped the course. Kind of was still nice to me, until she asked my grade in the class. Stopped talking to me until August after I said I got an A.

&#x200B;

August comes and we actually had a third roommate moving in (this was agreed on the previous year when we were friendly) and the roommate happens to be her bf's best friend, lets call him Adam. Adam moves in, wants to bring in a forth person from their friend group, I say no and this is the first confrontation. Jackie sends me a bitchy text and I stand my ground for decent reasons. After this, Jackie and Adam don't really talk to me and when they do, it's very fake like they're prying for information. One time Adam left the apartment and left his phone on the kitchen counter unlocked. A text from Jackie comes up as I am making lunch and the text says ""Is she still home?"". I couldn't help myself. I picked up his phone and went through his entire conversation with Jackie. It was early October and they had texts the whole way back to JULY talking about me. I am the only topic of conversation. THOUSANDS of texts ABOUT ME. Calling me every name in the book, TRACKING when I was home, talking about going through my things, threats, racist comments about my boyfriend... everything horrible that could be said was said. What really hurt me is that they had a full on 50+ text conversation about how I should kill myself. With gruesome disgusting details. These are 22 year old adults. When I read that segment I put the phone down and called one of my best friends. I was shaking from being so mad and crying from being so violated and hurt.. Two people I lived with were borderline stalking me and absolutely obsessed with me. I regret not taking pictures of these texts for a police report and restraining orders.

&#x200B;

I stopped talking to them immediately except when there were serious issues- Jackie not paying the bills and Jackie breaking into my room. Both times led to me confronting her in person with a stern tone. She stopped doing shit to me after I told her off for breaking into my room. So from then on, instead of messing with my shit or not paying things, Jackie and Adam would invite people over to have parties. They would throw things at my door. They would blast music. They would break anything I left outside of my room. They would call the landlord and lie about certain things to try to get me evicted. I would be at the gym or library and they would suddenly appear EVERY TIME in front of me as if they followed me out of the door. I later had a mutual friend tell me that Jackie reported me to the police for sexual assault AND reported me to the police again for stealing her credit card - which were both complete lies that obviously led to nothing. There were so many things that I just ignored for the sake of ""being civil"" and ""being a bigger person"". I dealt with so much harassment and bullshit for two years and I only told Jackie off twice. I wish I made her life a living hell. I wish I never went on the path to be a ""bigger person"" and ignoring all of this harassment. I wish I made her move out. She was a complete fucking asshole and I let her get away with it. I let her drag my name through mud and shit for the sake of being civil. I wish I told them both I read their entire text conversation just to watch them stand there scared and confused like rats trapped in a corner. I lived my life feeling utterly violated and stalked for 9 months while they both laughed about it and tried to ruin my life.

&#x200B;

I have held onto these memories and feelings for two years and I don't know why I was so afraid of them. They were passive fucking cowards that only started shit when they had 20 friends over or were talking over text. Christ I wish I ripped into them, especially for the suicide jokes/wishes. On a side note, Jackies mom also died one year after I moved out. Her mom killed herself.

&#x200B;

I stopped talking to them immediately except when there were serious issues- Jackie not paying the bills and Jackie breaking into my room. Both times led to me confronting her in person with a stern tone. She stopped doing shit to me after I told her off for breaking into my room. So from then on, instead of messing with my shit or not paying things, Jackie and Adam would invite people over to have parties. They would throw things at my door. They would blast music. They would break anything I left outside of my room. They would call the landlord and lie about certain things to try to get me evicted. I would be at the gym or library and they would suddenly appear EVERY TIME in front of me as if they followed me out of the door. I later had a mutual friend tell me that Jackie reported me to the police for sexual assault AND reported me to the police again for stealing her credit card - which were both complete lies that obviously led to nothing. There were so many things that I just ignored for the sake of ""being civil"" and ""being a bigger person"". I dealt with so much harassment and bullshit for two years and I only told Jackie off twice. I wish I made her life a living hell. I wish I never went on the path to be a ""bigger person"" and ignoring all of this harassment. I wish I made her move out. She was a complete fucking asshole and I let her get away with it. I let her drag my name through mud and shit for the sake of being civil. I wish I told them both I read their entire text conversation just to watch them stand there scared and confused like rats trapped in a corner. I lived my life feeling utterly violated and stalked for 9 months while they both laughed about it and tried to ruin my life.

&#x200B;

I have held onto these memories and feelings for two years and I don't know why I was so afraid of them. They were passive fucking cowards that only started shit when they had 20 friends over or were talking over text. Christ I wish I ripped into them, especially for the suicide jokes/wishes. On a side note, Jackies mom also died one year after I moved out. Her mom killed herself.

There were three separate incidents:

1. In the summer of 2017 with my close friend's girlfriend.
2. In the fall of 2017 with someone I had never met before.
3. **Last week with my best friend.**

I will try to provide as much context for each incident as I possibly can. **Please know that NONE of this is an excuse for any of the actions that I have committed. I have tried to write this all as objectively as I possibly can, but reading all of this back I realize that I might often sound like I am trying to downplay what I have done.

**The most important information regarding this current situation is in the third section, skip to the next bold line for the most necessary context.**

⁠1. I had just graduated from high school and was still getting over a breakup that had happened in the fall of my senior year (fall 2016). We had been together for a little over a year but we had broken up leaving me in a terrible depression that I had basically been ignoring for years. I had essentially set up the relationship as the most important thing in the world to me and I was using it to ignore all the problems that I was having. This was something I still didn't realize at the time and would probably not realize for another year or so. But it was around this time someone else came along, we'll call her [A], and she was the first one to be really affectionate towards me both physically and emotionally since my ex and so I thought that something could happen someday with her. But I soon found out from another friend of her's that she just tended to be flirty or appear affectionate around everyone and so I mostly gave up with her. I still remained in on and off contact with her through a connection of a close friend, we'll call him [N], and few months or so after I met her, [N] and [A] started dating. 

The following summer 2017 I was at a public event with [N], [A], and a few other friends. We had all been to many events like this in the past and [N] would often be too busy to talk to [A], and so I ended up talking to her a lot during these times. Even though she was in a relationship she was still as affectionate with other people as she was before, including me, and so I still felt a connection.

When I was at this event we were sitting next to each other on a couch. It's been too long for me to remember what I or she were talking about but what I do remember is that I was being more flirty than I had any right being to her. At some point during the night I remember laying back and pressing the back of my head into her chest. I also remember telling her that my hands were cold and so she voluntarily sat on them, but I groped her and so she got up. I apologized to her afterwards for how I acted and what I did, and that was it.

No charges were pressed by anyone, but later that night [N] told me over text that I had broken his trust beyond repair and so he, [A], and her group of friends who I had also known cut me out of their lives stopped talking to me. [N] and [A] would eventually have a bad break up a few months later though and so [N] gradually started talking to me more and more as he was also not talking to [A] or her friends anymore. Now I think we are what I would consider to be as good friends as we were before I had done this. I don't whether he chose to just forget about or forgive me for what happened, or if he just decided it didn't matter because he broke up with [A]. That is a conversation that I still need to have with him and will have when I feel the time is right for it.

⁠2. I had just moved into college and was meeting a lot of new people in my dorm. Our building had around twenty floors with a lounge on every third floor so I would go from lounge to lounge a lot of nights to socialize with people. One night in the early fall of my freshman year (2017) I went into a lounge and met a girl who I had never met before, we'll call her [T]. She invited me to lie down next to her on a couch in the lounge and I did. She was being flirty with me and joked about me being her new boyfriend and soon after I gave her a short kiss on the lips. I remember she was taken aback by it, but I don't remember how she exactly reacted to it. I do know that after I did that she still let me stay with her. We ended up kissing a few more times and talked for almost an hour still lying down together. 

During that time she had basically turned me down and made some kind of joke about ""just using my right hand."" I grossly misinterpreted this as a literal request because my right hand was free and so I grabbed her breast before she told me to stop and I had realized that I made a mistake. After that she still let me stay and I think I may have tried to grab her one or two more times but I don't remember. Either way she still let me stay and I didn't leave until it was getting late and she asked me to. I went back to my own room and we still texted for a little while after that, and then I went to sleep. 

The next morning however she told me that I had violated her and so she reported me to our college's Title IX office. After this happened I had felt actively suicidal because of what I had done and so I contacted my therapist and she ended up checking me into the local mental hospital. 

Once again no charges were pressed and I only ended up getting a warning from the Title IX office the very next day and a no-contact order signed by [T].

**Skip to here for the third section.**

⁠3. Only a couple of weeks after the second incident happened (later fall 2017) I had met the person who would eventually become my best friend for the next two years, we'll call her [C]. We had met on tinder but things didn't work out between us in the beginning. She wasn't in a relationship at the time but she also was going through a lot of personal issues that lead her to temporarily cut everyone out of her life including me. 

When she had finally figured out the problems she was having she started talking to everyone again but by the time she started talking to me again she had already found someone else and started a relationship with them. A few months later she ended up breaking up with him and dating someone else who she has been with ever since. In the short time between those two relationships I tried making a move on her but she said that she still only saw me as a friend and that I wasn't her type.

Before this point the two of us were not very close. We still knew each other decently well but it wasn't until after she got into her current relationship that I felt like she started warming up to me more. During this time she started giving me more affection both emotionally and physically. We ended up learning almost everything about each other, and I eventually told her about the two previous incidents that I have written about here. When I told her about them she said that she still didn't see me any differently than before and that she understood that I had been trying to move on from them and that was trying to become a better person than I was at that time. Along with this, she would also let me be very handsy with her. She eventually told me that she did it because she knew that I was lonely and she felt that I needed it, and that she would reciprocate more if she didn't have a boyfriend. It was to the point that we were often cuddling together and only one step away from kissing. Some people who saw us together even assumed that we were actually dating, which was something she jokingly made note of to me on several occasions. These factors are what made [C] the person I was closest to at school as well as my best friend at the time. And even though she was already in a relationship I just ended up falling in love with her more and more because she was the only person who I felt like I could really talk to and be close to. And so despite what she had said about me when we first met I thought that I might have a chance with her someday. This kind of relationship with her went on for almost a year and a half up until last week.

Last Thursday night I went back to her place and we were lying down on top of each other while talking until we eventually started napping, which is something we had done a few times in the past. Eventually she said she was going to move upstairs to her bed and she said I could sleep with her if I wanted to. She eventually fell asleep but I was unable to because I didn't have my meds with me that I usually take to fall asleep and I became very restless. While she was asleep I ended up grinding against her while grabbing her breasts. I also kissed her on the cheeks and forehead and lightly on her lips. She didn't wake up until I grabbed her breast a little harder and when she did she slapped me and said that what I did wasn't okay, but that she really didn't care and wasn't affected by it, and that it wasn't going to ruin our friendship. Despite that I still felt guilty and I told her so, which lead to a conversation where I told her how I really felt about her. She ended up telling me again that I wasn't her type, and that I had never had any chance with her from the start. I ended up crying for a while, I think it was the combination of both heartbreak and guilt. At that point she still trusted me enough to let me stay the rest of the night with her in her bed. I still didn't sleep for the rest of the night and in the morning I felt sick to my stomach and still immensely guilty. I told her that I didn't want to lose her and she assured me that I wouldn't. I left her house soon after.

The next day however, she texted me saying that she changed her mind and that she now did not feel comfortable around me anymore. She also said that anything she said the night before about her not being affected by what I did was now invalidated because at the time she said she had not fully processed what happened. For the next day or two I begged her over text for her forgiveness but she refused.  

In these text conversations and the conversation we had the night before I had expressed a want to kill myself because of what I had done to her. She was still worried enough about me to notify my dorm's residence director who then called my college's police. This lead to my second visit to the local mental hospital since my previous visit there almost two years prior from the second situation I wrote about.  

Once again no charges were pressed by anyone. However when I was at the mental hospital I ended up telling my building's residence director who brought me there what I had done. Because of this he said he was obligated to tell our school's Title IX office and that they would be contacting both me and [C] soon. It has been almost a week however and I have not been contacted, so I do not know if they have contacted [C] or if they will actually contact me, as I was contacted by them almost immediately the time before. 

**TL;DR/Conclusion**

And that's where I am now. I feel both heartbroken and immensely guilty for what I have done. For almost two years I have been, and still am, extremely in love with this girl and I feel even more guilty for still feeling that way. [C] would sometimes talk about the problems she was having with her boyfriend and recently told me that she was thinking of breaking up with him within the next two or three months. I think that a lot of our friendship was riding on that chance that I thought I could have with her someday. What I did to her was a grave mistake, but my other mistake was being such a fucking idiot by letting myself be friends with her for so long under the false pretenses and unrealistic expectations that I had made for us. She told me she always knew how I felt about her. But I was too much of a coward to ever say how I felt to her face because I was afraid that it would ruin the only chance I thought had with her. And so I just let our relationship go on the way it did until I let my impulsiveness and impatience get to me and hurt her.

For a long time now, being in a committed relationship with somebody has been a very important thing to me that I feel a lot of my happiness depends on. Before I was using my relationship to avoid the personal problems I was having, but now I believe that it would be healthier because I have since figured out a lot of my problems and have been able to get myself a little further out of the depression that I have been in for years. I have felt for a long time now that I was the most physically and mentally healthy I've ever been in my life, but  despite that I am still extremely impatient and impulsive. And that has lead me to do terrible things to people, some of them who were very very close to me.

I believe that these three incidents are partially a result of me misinterpreting signals from people (either in the moment with [T], beforehand with [C], or both with [A]), and largely a result of me being unable to control my impulses and my tendency to be impatient and desperate when it comes to meeting people that I want to date. Had only the first two incidents happened I think I would have been able to move on from them because that's what I thought I was able to do until now. 

Because now this third incident has happened. I've hurt my best and only friend that I have here and now I'm probably going to lose her forever. I don't know how to live with the guilt and pain that I feel. I don't want to be a bad person and I want to be trusted and loved by someone someday. But I don't know how anybody could ever love me or trust me or forgive me because now I don't even feel like I can even trust myself. I believe in giving people second chances but now I'm on far more than that and I've lost my best friend because of what I've done. I deserve every ounce of pain and guilt that I feel right now but I don't know how I can ever live with it or forgive myself for what I've done. I really don't. I feel like a terrible person and I feel like I don't deserve to live because of it.","I have committed three instances of sexual assault over the past two and a half years, including on my best friend, and I don't know how to live with the guilt. This is going to be a very long post because all three incidents require almost three years of context altogether, with the most recent one probably needing the most.

19604,b40wl1,post,I’m worried that I may have sexually assaulted someone years ago,"Hi everyone. Without making the story too long, here’s what happened: I was having my first sexual experience years ago when I was younger and less emotionally in tune with other people. It was with a family friend and we’re both girls who thought we were attracted to girls. We started playing this game that she came up with where we would “tickle” each other’s backs and stomachs until we fell asleep. We would take turns, one person tickling the other while the person being tickled just lied there. Eventually, as the months wore on, the game got more sexual one night.

She ended up touching me very sexually on the butt, making me groan, to which she responded with a kind of dirty sexual joke. From then on, I also started making things more sexual. When it was my turn to “tickle” her, I would also run my hands over her breasts and butt and in between her legs. However, I noticed that she wouldn’t touch me as intimately when it was her turn to “tickle” me. I was a lot more turned on/into it at this point than she was. At the time, I was confused as to why she wasn’t touching me as intimately as I was touching her, so at one point, I asked her if she could “touch me lower” (my exact words). She responded by indeed touching me lower, but only on my lower stomach. I then said “lower” to which she finally did touch me in between my legs, but I remember it was quick/rushed/seemed like she wanted to get it over with. 

This moment makes me question if things were consensual and, looking back, I feel like her being less eager/enthusiastic/turned on than I was and not touching me as much were indicators that she was uncomfortable and I should’ve at least stopped and checked in with her. So I don’t know if my actions are in line with sexual assault. 

One last note: A few years after this incident, we were hanging out in the first time in a while (we don’t see each other much because we live in different states) and she brought this incident up and started laughing about it, saying “We were so weird hahaha” and was generally just joking around about it. 

tl;dr I played a weird game with a female friend of mine years ago where we took turns touching each other except I was touching her more than she was touching me, and she seemed pretty reluctant to touch me when I asked (but still did). I didn’t think about it at the time, but now I’m very worried that she was very uncomfortable by this and that, something that started out fun for both of us, turned into sexual assault. 

EDIT: I should also mention that since this happened, this friend will still gladly sleep in the same bed as me, really really likes me as a friend (as far as I can tell) and even feels comfortable being half-naked around me, so I don’t know if that counts for anything.","I’m worried that I may have sexually assaulted someone years ago Hi everyone. Without making the story too long, here’s what happened: I was having my first sexual experience years ago when I was younger and less emotionally in tune with other people. It was with a family friend and we’re both girls who thought we were attracted to girls. We started playing this game that she came up with where we would “tickle” each other’s backs and stomachs until we fell asleep. We would take turns, one person tickling the other while the person being tickled just lied there. Eventually, as the months wore on, the game got more sexual one night.

She ended up touching me very sexually on the butt, making me groan, to which she responded with a kind of dirty sexual joke. From then on, I also started making things more sexual. When it was my turn to “tickle” her, I would also run my hands over her breasts and butt and in between her legs. However, I noticed that she wouldn’t touch me as intimately when it was her turn to “tickle” me. I was a lot more turned on/into it at this point than she was. At the time, I was confused as to why she wasn’t touching me as intimately as I was touching her, so at one point, I asked her if she could “touch me lower” (my exact words). She responded by indeed touching me lower, but only on my lower stomach. I then said “lower” to which she finally did touch me in between my legs, but I remember it was quick/rushed/seemed like she wanted to get it over with. 

This moment makes me question if things were consensual and, looking back, I feel like her being less eager/enthusiastic/turned on than I was and not touching me as much were indicators that she was uncomfortable and I should’ve at least stopped and checked in with her.

19605,b3m9md,post,I sexually assaulted someone last night and it's eating me alive (long),"First off, I want to say that i'm not doing this to make myself feel better the point of this is to get suggestions on what I should do. Last night a group of friends and I went out to the bars. We ran into a group of girls (some were mutual friends others weren't). One of the girls who I did not know started talking, having a couple drinks and I thought that it was going well and that she was enjoying herself. At one point our group decides to all head over to a buddy of mine's house.

I got back to the house and her and I talked some more had a few more drinks. At this point I'm drunk (still making conscious decisions) and she from what I could tell is more around buzzed but I can't be sure. The night starts winding down and everyone is leaving but the girls she came with were staying the night with two of my friends so she decided she was going to sleep at the house too. She didn't choose to stay at the house with me she more or less didn't have a choice because of that, and this is where I look back and should have realized the situation. So now we're alone, from the signs that I thought she was giving me (physical contact, engaged in conversation, at one point she said she thought I was attractive), I decided to try and make my move and I went to kissed her on the lips. She didn't pull away from it but she also didn't exactly kiss me back, instead she kind of smiled and said ""i'm tired I'm going to lay down for the night"" and she did. I was discouraged but not angry in anyway, and I went and had a few more drinks.

At this point I'm pretty drunk I come back to the room she is laying on the couch and watching Netflix and I ask if its okay if I lay with her. She tells me ""yes"" but not enthusiastically but I couldn't tell that from the state of mind I was in (not and excuse). I lay down and we talk for a little bit while I was rubbing her back probably trying to see if it will get her in the mood. Well after a while we both end up falling asleep, I wake up probably less than 30mins later while she's still asleep and its like i'm almost out of my own body I started rubbing her thigh, in the back of my mind I knew it was wrong but I just couldn't stop. I just kept going taking another step next thing I knew I had my hand under her shirt and I was touching her breasts, she never woke up and I kept justifying it thinking in my head that she's can't really still be sleeping and if she wanted me to stop she would tell me, then in the next second I had my hand down her pants and I was trying to rub her vagina, this is when she made a twitch to close her legs but I don't know if that was her consciously doing so or just a movement she made in her sleep. I didn't go any further than that and I never initiated  sex or penetrated her but I know that this is definitely assault because there was no consent and she was sleeping I felt the regret and fear instantly. 

We woke up the next morning and she seemed to act like nothing happened which I know a lot of sexual assault victims do stuff like that out of fear or disbelief or I don't even know I've never been this situation before I tried to make small talk with her but I was scared to bring it up because I don't know if she knew what happened. She seems like a very nice girl and she didn't deserve what I did at all. I want to come clean but I don't know what to do, I'm in college and I have friends that have been assaulted and even raped and to think that I'm putting somebody else through what they went through is tearing my mind apart. What should I do I know I should come clean to her and talk about it but I don't know how to go about it. I haven't got out of bed all day and I know if this is how feel she feels even worse.

19606,b3luc3,post,I tried to kiss someone without their consent; overwhelmed by guilt,"Hi everyone...A few years ago when I was a teenager, I was at a party and drunk, and I jumped onto the lap of a random boy and tried to kiss him and he didn’t want to. He was moving his head from side to side, trying to avoid my lips, and I kept trying to catch his lips for about ~10 seconds before I realized how horrible what I was doing was, jumped off his lap, and started apologizing profusely. He was VERY uncomfortable afterwards, and I felt so bad and kept trying to do things to make him feel more comfortable, but eventually I just left the room. After I left, he made out with a different girl and, when I came back, he was a lot happier and visibly comfortable, and he told me that even though he did feel uncomfortable at the time with what I did, he doesn’t feel uncomfortable anymore. And then, as he was leaving the room, I made a sexual joke and he ran away (probably uncomfortable again). 

I’m, honestly, really horrified by my actions! I know what I did was sexual assault, and I feel pretty wrapped in guilt over this. I mainly just hope and pray that this guy isn’t super hurt by my actions, that this didn’t affect him and his life (I don’t really know how he feels bc he was just some random stranger at a party). I just don’t know how to live with myself after doing such a horrible thing to another person. This was a few years ago and one of the first times I had ever been drunk, which is NOT an excuse, I think at the time I didn’t realize the extent of the effects alcohol would have on me....

I haven’t done anything like this since, and I’m VERY conscious of issues like sexual assault and my actions in general, and I believe that sexual assault should be taken very seriously and that it’s a pretty horrific thing to do to a person, so I’m having a lot of trouble dealing with what I did...
 
Anyways, how bad were my actions? Is it reasonable for me to be wrapped up in guilt over this? Is it likely that he is still really hurt by this? Does an action like this define me??

tl;dr I attempted to kiss a boy at a party once who didn’t want to, he felt uncomfortable for a little bit, I then made a sexual joke in poor taste to him, and now I’m wrapped up in guilt over this because I can’t believe I did something so wrong and because I worry that he’s still hurt over this in some way.

19607,b1qqph,post,I sexually assaulted multiple women when I was a teenager.,"Every year my middle school would throw a carnival at the end the year. My 8th grade year I had been watching a lot of YouTube videos on how to talk girls. What the videos boiled down to was be confident. However I misinterpreted being confident, with doing whatever the fuck I wanted. So during the carnival I would walk around and try to flirt with girls, and if they reciprocated with a laugh or smile at one of my jokes, i would take it a step way to far by grabbing their butt, or poking their breasts. I even tried to motor boat a girl. The girls would usually, laugh or smile, but looking back they were definitely uncomfortable, and were just trying to get me to leave them alone. Fast forward a few months later, and I'm in high school. Me and my friends were sitting outside after school, when one of our classmates asked us if we had any change she could borrow. I stupidly said, ""If you want my money your gonna have to earn it."" Then proceeded to poke her boob. I started chuckling to myself, but quickly realized no one else was laughing. There was an awkward silence. The rest of the incident went down like this.

Girl: ""What the fuck.""

My Friend: ""What the fuck dude."" Then proceeds to slap me in the face.

Me: Gives her the money in shame while trying to apologize.

Girl: walks away without saying anything.

I quickly realized after this instance that what I was doing was definitely not ok. I somehow never got reported at all for this behavior, and was never punished, and i think that's what bothers me the most about this whole ordeal. The fact that I never got what was coming to me. It's been years since this happened, and all I can say is that i was a complete creep/ass hole back then, and I'm not even gonna try to defend myself. I've thought about reaching out and apologizing to the people I assaulted, but I don't want forgiveness for what I did. I feel like if i were forgiven, what i did would somehow become ok, and i don't ever want what i did to be ok.","I sexually assaulted multiple women when I was a teenager.

19608,b0xyzp,post,I just found out/realized I'm a perpetrator of sexual assault and I don't know how to live with myself,"My last long-term relationship of 14 months ended a year and a half ago. I met my friend, (and not-yet girlfriend) through a social justice oriented event we both cared about. I messaged her a while later, we made plans to go for a bike ride and to the beach, and I felt some pretty intense chemistry right off the bat, but she told me she was healing from childhood trauma and wasn't interested in dating. Pretty quickly we were hanging out regularly, and having non-sexual sleepovers where we would cuddle. She told me she liked cuddling but didn't want anything else from me.

Eventually we went to a music festival, and I didn't have a tent so she told me I could sleep in hers and we could cuddle. One of the nights (I'm pretty sure I was inebriated but that's not an excuse), I remember giving her a kiss on the mouth, while she was sleeping. I don't remember it well, but I'm pretty sure I knew she was asleep (but not really sure). When we got back from the festival we both had a recovery day and she wanted to spend the night at my place again. I remember at this point, I couldn't deal emotionally with my feelings for her and told her she could stay over that night but we'd have to stop having sleepovers if she viewed me strictly in a platonic way. That night she kissed me. We made out for a while, chatted, and a couple of weeks later were officially dating.

After about 14 months of officially dating, she started seeing someone else and then ended up dumping me for him. I was hurt but we maintained our friendship, and have seen each other occasionally since then, though things have been heated at times (she said something incredibly hurtful to me while we were on a road trip with friends 8 months ago and I gave her the cold shoulder for a couple of days)

Last night she messaged me and asked if she could come over to talk about our friendship. When she came over, she started the conversation by saying she felt like I had resented her, and we talked about that for a bit. I've completely moved on and hadn't intended any coldness in my interactions with her recently, so I let her know that, and apologized for the lack of warmth she was sensing from our communications. I told her I was resentful of her around the break-up because of how things ended, but it was for the best and I had moved on from any negative feelings. I told her that I love her and value her friendship and that I want us to be able to remain close friends.

Then she told me some things that made me want to jump out of my skin. She told me that I kissed her before that music festival while she was sleeping one night (I don't remember that), and then told me about the time I kissed her in the tent, again while she was sleeping (which I did remember and was incredibly ashamed of). She told me that she started dating me because she loved our connection and felt 'safe' with me, and didn't want to lose me (though after some reflection I realized there were definitely some inconsistencies in what she remembers as our first time actually making out; she thought it was a week after the festival in some weird circumstances)

But the worst thing that I did (which I have no recollection of) is that I fingered her in her sleep one night. I was shocked and asked her if she would be comfortable sharing details because I flat out couldn't remember doing something so unforgivably horrible. She said it was about 6-8 months into our relationship while she was staying at my place one night.

I don't remember it, and would never have imagined I'd be capable of doing something like that. I asked her if she ever talked to me about it and she said no, but that she woke up to me fingering her while I was wide awake, and told me to stop.

This would have taken place around 2 years ago now, and even though I can't remember it, I told her I trust her, and don't know how I could have done something so terrible, and can't even understand how she could bear to be friends with me at this point.

I'm kind of at a loss now and don't even know how I can proceed with my life. I can't imagine doing something like that, and the thought of it makes me sick. I'm making arrangements to talk with a therapist, but also am considering asking her to press charges if she's comfortable, because when I think of assault from an outsider perspective, I don't think assailants should get a free pass, and I've always been supportive of victims. However, in this case, \*I'm\* the perpetrator, and I don't even know how to proceed. I want to confess and tell people about it, to apologize publicly, to out myself, and I know that will result in losing all of my friends (because I'm not friends with the types of people who would condone sexual assault). I don't know how I can ever have a relationship again because I feel like I should be obligated to disclose the type of person I am. I expect I'll lose my career and the support of everyone who currently cares about me, and I believe I deserve it. But looking at it objectively I think that's what I deserve. I've never felt deeply sympathetic for other people who've done similar things, and I don't know how to go on living as a purported ally of sexual abuse victims when I'm everything I hate in the world.","I just found out/realized I'm a perpetrator of sexual assault and I don't know how to live with myself My last long-term relationship of 14 months ended a year and a half ago.

19609,aw6o7z,post,I probably sexually assaulted a girl I'd just met at a bar.,"I have been overwhelmed with guilt for the past 2 days. The worst part is that I don't remember exactly what happened. I met two girls (We'll call them Abby and Macy) at a karaoke bar who were really cool and really fun. I had had far too much already and I was still drinking. The three of us were friendly all night. We sang Let It Go from Frozen together. I don't remember the order of events, but here's what I do remember:

\- at one point Abby and I kissed. It was consensual.

\- Eventually the bar closed and we went outside.

\- Abby mentioned being in a relationship, Macy was talking about her husband.

\- The 3 of us were the last to leave the bar, we spent 2 AM to 3 AM outside the bar. I don't really remember how we filled that time.

\- Abby was able to drive by the end of the night.

I believe Macy was intoxicated but I don't know to what extent either of them were.

Eventually the two of them were sitting on the curb behind Abby's car. They were kind of cuddling, Abby was sitting on the curb and Macy was between Abby's legs and curled up into a ball. At this point Macy said that she wanted to do the same thing but with me instead of Abby, so Abby and I switched places. So I was sitting on the curb with my arms around Macy. I put my hand under her shirt and rubbed her back. I remember asking ""Is this ok?"" to which there was no response. So I said ""you didn't say anything so that's a no"" and I took my hand out, at which point she did say yes it's ok. So I continued rubbing her back for a little bit. Eventually she shifted position so that my hand was on her tummy instead of her back. I remember my finger grazing her nipple slightly (she wasn't wearing a bra), and I guess I got embarrassed or remorseful because I took my hand right out. I don't remember what happened immediately after.

What bothers me is that I don't remember asking if it was ok to bring my hand higher. She didn't say or do anything in response to it, but consent should always be positive and emphatic, and I don't remember having that. I don't know how she feels about what happened but I know what I did is wrong. I feel sick to my stomach. I never imagined that I would be guilty of something like this, and I never realized how quickly something fun and consensual could turn into what could be considered assault.

I became facebook friends with Abby and as of right now we are still friends.

I'm not sure if it's against the rules of this sub to ask for advice on what to do next. Do I apologize? Or just stay the fuck out of her life and hope that's the end of it? I don't know how she feels about what happened. Honestly it's still possible that I did ask for consent and just don't remember. There is so much I don't remember and the uncertainty is killing me.

I know nothing I can do can change what has already happened, but I know that I need to make a serious change. I have no desire to ever get drunk again, at least not until I feel I can trust myself to never again put myself in a situation like that.","I probably sexually assaulted a girl I'd just met at a bar.

19610,as7t6w,post,I was sexually assaulted and basically mentally abused in high school by a 'friend' and couldn't feel like I could tell my then SO and gave me an eating disorder,"Long, sorry

My junior year this guy in a class of mine kind of started being nice to me and started hanging around me. We hung out and he was kind of douche and a weirdo but nice enough at the time I guess. Then he got kind of flirty and he knew i had a boyfriend and saw me hanging around him but never would actually talk to him EVER. Like he would barely look at me if I was next to him. He is also a huge pathological liar with an ego the size of Texas with self hate flowing like Niagara Falls.

 Eventually he told me he loved me and would die for me and my boyfriend saw the text before I did on my phone and asked me to follow up in the morning since it was late and I did and he goes on a huge rant with lies and I stop responding and he keeps texting for about 3 hours. I'm freaked then he posts a picture of a scar on his face that he's told multiple people different stories about the origin. 

At that point people told me it seemed like he was stalking me and that he obviously was infatuated. He made me keep talking to him because I was the only one he considered a friend but I was still uncomfortable. He manipulated and lied to me to try to make me his plaything. He tried to touch me and ignored my boundaries. I think if my boyfriend knew what was really going on at the time he would have killed the guy.

During the course if our ""friendship"" he would put his arm on my back or up the back of my shirt. I tried to tell him no but would act upset and turn it into me comforting him. He made me get into the back seat of his or my car and basically try to feel me up under the guise of talking but end up being some sick need to fill a void for human connection. He tried and sometimes gave me ""massages"" because he was a licensed masseuse (another lie) but me saying no never ended up ever making a difference to him. He would show up before me at school and wait for when I still got there at an ungodly hour of like 6:45 and leave school when I did so he could walk in and out with me. He would make me feel guilty for not wanting him there or if I didnt talk to him and wanted to hang out with other friends. It destroyed my sense of boundaries and the touching eventually led to some small comments about flat stomachs and being small. Which lead me to restrict and stop eating as a form of trying to control some part of my life. And when I finally told him to fuck off and i was done, he called me a bitch and tried to degrade me then made it seem like I was the bad guy. No one believed anything he said which was nice but he still told people we slept together and others a threesome. But eventually, he pinned me and forced his tongue down my throat and I was left powerless and that wasn't even the end of his abuse. I felt broken.

The recoil of touch and lack of feeling eventually put a wedge between my boyfriend and I and combined with my schedule he was done and thought I just had lost interest in him. 

He got kicked out of school after a friend talked to administration for me and no one would tell me exactly what happened. I didn't want to talk about it but others were called in to talk about him and then after a long weekend he didn't come back. It was a sense of relief like no other.

I still have flare ups of the eating disorder(anorexia and bulimia) and have gone to therapy for boundaries, trust issues, and the trauma. I get scared when I see someone like him. I had scratched my sides and wrists and thumbs raw and bloody from stress. I had hair fall out. I had cried my eyes swollen and fell asleep with tear stains on my face. It was a traumatic experience that made me want to kill myself at times and I felt like I had to keep going because I didn't want him to put anyone else through what he did with me. My therapist said that his description sounded in line with future domestic abusers. She said I was lucky to stand up at all. 

TLDR: this guy started stalking me and pretty much did everything but rape me. He broke me mentally with abuse and manipulation. Almost a year later I still get fits of rage and remorse and phantom touches that makes me skin feel like its crawling. This made me become emotionally and physically unavailable to my then boyfriend that I refused to talk to about him and eventually he broke up with me because he thought I was no longer invested in the relationship but I actually couldn't handle talking about it to anyone at the time, especially my boyfriend.

19611,aqs3l0,post,I sexually assaulted my professor when I was in college and I feel absolutely horrible.,"Its been 11 years since this incident, I was 20 and in college. I was a bit of a... well, hoe? I slept with a ton of dudes, I went out of my way to try and look as attractive as possible, I constantly wore revealing outfits. I used to 'pick out' men who I wanted to sleep with and went out of my way to try and seduce them basically. For me it was kind of a power trip. 

I had one professor who I was very attracted to. Fit, handsome guy, looked kind of like Salah, the soccer player. I wanted to sleep with him really badly, so I would talk to him and flirt with him after class a lot. We got friendly, and I thought he was 'ready' so to speak to take it to the next level, so I got extra flirty one day. He looked kind of shy but he was friendly enough and responding, and then I noticed he had a hard on, clear as day, in his pants. I don't even know what came over me, but I just smiled at him and put my hand  up his shirt so I felt his abs, then reached down into his pants and grabbed his dick. I tugged at it for like one second before he sort of yelped and said ""please please stop"". The whole encounter lasted maybe 6-7 seconds, I guess he was paralyzed by what I did that he didn't respond right away. I wasn't even looking at his face until then, but when I did he looked horrified. I don't know why I just automatically assumed he would be into it, but he looked REALLY red in the face and terrified at what I just did. I just said I was sorry, and he just said he was getting married, and he literally looked like he wanted to cry. I just repeated that I was sorry, and then I left his office. 

I finished the class, but I never looked him in the eyes again. His face after I did that still makes me feel horribly guilty. I could tell he was visibly shaken by what I did. It feels even worse because I didn't merely grope him over his pants, I fully reached down and grabbed his entire dick. 

I wouldn't end my hoe phase yet, but I definitely slowed down. At 21 I found my current husband, who I married at 23. I have 3 kids now so I am basically a full time mom. My husband has zero idea what I did, nor will I ever tell him. ","I sexually assaulted my professor when I was in college and I feel absolutely horrible.

19612,ap7icx,post,I am not reporting a child rapist in fear of losing my family,"About 14 years ago, when I was 6, my uncle sexual assaulted me. I had reported what had happened to my mother and aunt but both chose to do nothing. In fact my mother told me to keep the incidence to myself, as if I had done something shameful. 

There are high numbers of rape cases in the country where I'm from and families often cover it up in fear of being shunned or losing their jobs. 

My family and I have moved away to US not too long afterwards and have been here since.  
Although it's been more than a decade, I still have moments where I have uncontrollable breakdowns in private knowing that there is a man out there who took advantage of my vulnerability and walked away free. There isn't a day that goes by where I don't feel crushed by guilt and fear that I may be letting this abuse happen to another child. 

The truth is, I am so used to my rape being minimized that I no longer have the trust to open up and confide in somebody. I feel trapped and alone. On the outside, I never miss the opportunity to meet new people and do whatever I can to help another person. I do well in school, take care of my health, volunteer and have lots of hobbies. I try to bring light to life and make people laugh and smile. My friends would describe me as an outgoing and creative person. At times, it feels like my past was just a fever dream. 

It as been years since my mother and I spoke of the incident and we have a good overall relationship. She is my mother and I have forgiven her, although I do not agree with her choices. 

I don't know how to go about reporting this to the police of the country where I'm from. They have a reputation for not taking old cases seriously, especially family ones. I also have no desire to open a Pandora's box of negativity. I want to move forward in my life and hope that someday I can forgive myself.

TL;DR
I was sexually assaulted as a child and my family never reported it to the police. The man just walked away free and it disgusts me knowing that he may be continuing to abuse other children. By going to the police, I risk having people know what my parents did and what happened to me.

Our relationship has been sexual but only over texts and pictures. Until yesterday there had only been cuddling. Last night her and I were spooning on the floor with some light grinding.

I made the assumption that she was moving my hand to her crouch so I prematurely moved my hand there and started rubbing. Eventually I made my way under her pants and continued.

Now today she's texting me saying that she only meant to move my hand to her waist, and that when I went for her crouch she was too afraid to say anything or stop me. As bad as that sounds, she's not mad enough to press charges or anything, she just said that she's currently very uncomfortable with what happened and thinks we should take a short break for her to gather her thoughts.

I feel like I need to tell everyone I meet that I'm a rapist. ",7,22.0,2019-01-15 2:57,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/ag3vpj/i_coerced_my_high_school_boyfriend_into_sex_at_a/,Neutral

19617,af3gsg,post,I sexually assaulted my best friend and this is the story off my chest,"  

It was my first year at university. I was thrilled. Honestly, I was a bit scared. Having gone through my college years of GAD (generalised anxiety disorder) and hardly ever attending, I scrambled together some mediocre grades and got a place at a University. I made some friends during freshers, but nobody really close, these friends didn’t really invite me to anything, you know? I always had to ask if somethings happening, didn’t help they were in a different flat. Anyways, after freshers, I made some close friends, two people I would consider my best friends, back then.

We formed our friends group and constantly invited new people and made friends. I was a virgin and kiss-less at the time, so I would constantly be on the subreddit “Seduction” to do research and put the stuff I learned into practise. I finally lost my virginity to a girl. I was on top of the world. I did more stuff with other girls. I had an amazing friends group. Sure, there was drama at times…But overall, it was fucking awesome.

Well, it was fucking awesome until girl A joined the group. Now, whenever there were girls joining our group, I never really interacted with them because people would joke around like “oh he’s trying to get with her “. So, I pretty much just ignored her. Friend A on the other hand, he loves to flirt with girls and he’s extremely confident. He sort of taught me a lot that I know today. Anyways, girl A had a boyfriend, but friend A didn’t really care and just kept talking/flirting with her. Turns out that she was on a long break with this boyfriend and things weren’t going too well. So, friend A decides he can potentially get in there. Now, I genuinely loved Friend A, and I wanted the best for him, so I wing manned him a lot. Friend A and girl A became quite romantically involved, no sex or anything, but a lot of kissing. Friend A was obsessed with her. He fell in love within a week. But so, did she. Then, when friend A confessed this love, she also returned it. She told Friend A everything he wanted to hear. Friend A obviously wanted a relationship but she didn’t want to officially break up with her long-term boyfriend. 

She constantly told Friend A things such as: you’re the best thing ever, you’d be the best boyfriend. You know? Stuff like that. She’d say she loves him and he’d say it back. Then, one day, she decides things are going too far right? She has a boyfriend that she’s on a “break” with, so she decides to tell friend A that she just wants to be friends after saying she loves him. Friend A is distraught and assumes she’s gotten back with her BF. She had not. Friend A decides to just be friends with her. They’d still hang out, and she’d kiss him and flirt with him. Bizarre. I was fully involved at this point, trying to sort out this thing. I honestly wanted them to just be together because they were perfect, and I loved seeing my mate so happy. Numerous times over, she’d say she just wants to be friends with him and then he’d get mad and scream at her, and then the next day she’d tell him she loves him. Over and over again. A complete cycle of bullshit. Lmao.

One night, we’re all out clubbing (like the full group of more people), and we’re all having fun, but obviously them two are having drama, so Friend A storms off, and then Girl A starts flirting with me and then another friend breaks up a moment where we’re about to kiss (we were both intoxicated). Anyways, that night, friend A didn’t see any of that, but at one point he’s screaming at her and then storms off in the middle of the street and Girl A is crying in the middle of the road. I genuinely felt really bad for her because I never could fully understand why he would get so aggressive. I talked to her about it, we spoke with friend A, and everything was sorted, they were just going to be friends.

Friend A was constantly a bit of a dick to me at times. But he became even more so. Maybe he blamed me for ending their “relationship”? I don’t know. Me and the whole group sort of disliked him because he made a lot of drama and was a dick to people. After that night where everything was sorted, girl A starts messaging me a lot, and being quite flirty, which I flirted back to. She invited me to her room like the next day and we just chilled and stayed up all night chatting about life, nothing romantic. I asked her about the moment we nearly kissed in the club, but she claimed she doesn’t remember. She kept constantly inviting me to the library, which I accepted. After having bad anxiety for 2 years, and not being able to leave my room, I decided to not turn down opportunities, I should be grateful that I can leave my house without throwing up, feeling anxious, head spinning, feeling tired and unwell, so I accepted every offer from people at university. Friend A was extremely jealous that I was hanging out with girl A. We both told him nothing is going on and we’re just friends. Times pass, she becomes my gym buddy, my library buddy, my hangout buddy. We would constantly message each other. We would flirt for a joke. And then, when we went clubbing, we would get drunk and dance together, and then I’d lean in and so would she and then she’d usually pull away and tell me we can’t kiss. This happened a lot. Why didn’t I just get the message right? Well, there were tons of mixed signals. She’d grind on me at the bar, sometimes she’d even lean in herself. We’d hold hands and hug and flirt with many sex jokes. Now this whole time, I was constantly battling myself, telling myself she’s just a friend and I shouldn’t do anything. She then goes and tells friend A the other reason she hasn’t kissed me is because of him. Kind of a mixed signal to be honest.

Anyways, we’d video call all the time, still flirt, she’d tell me to stop flirting, and I’d stop and then she’d flirt with me so I continued again. One night, we were drunk and in the same bed and cuddling and says fuck it and we start dry humping but then she stays stop so we stop. It’s like, when I’m sober I’m like ok she’s just a friend, no problem, girls and guys can be friends. But when we’re both drunk, the barrier goes and we sort of lose control. Friend A hated all of this and heard about it, and seen it all. He called me a dick friend, and I always knew it was wrong what I was doing, considering he was still in love with her this whole time, but it didn’t stop me because she wasn’t an object and she could make her own decisions. I don’t even know my own thought pattern to be honest. I just sort of went with it. He always told us if anything happened, he’d never speak to us ever again.

So, there was a holiday break, I go back to my country and we’re constantly video calling. And I badly missed her, so I told her that I liked her in more than a friend way because I don’t just miss my friends. She tells me she doesn’t feel the same way. I respect that and move on quite quickly, but I just continue to be her friend. Friend A, tells us that he doesn’t love her anymore and we can do anything. The next day, I arrive back at university and there’s a little group party. My parents gave me alcohol so I said I’d share it with her. We drank a 1/3 of a bottle of prosecco and a 1/3 bottle of wine each. Then, I drank her some of her schnapps, which was already mostly gone. She was wearing quite a casual outfit and then she asked me if she should change and I told her no there’s no need. She then strangely changed her outfit from casual into a dress. I wondered like, is there a reason for this, I don’t know… 

Anyways, we head from the party to another friends flat, we’re holding hands and talking about how “coupley” we are. We get there, and we both start drinking some more schnapps. Maybe an hour or so later, I offer out my hand and take her into the corridor, and I lean in to kiss her, she tells me no and then a second later starts dry humping me. So I lean in again, and she tries to move away, so I grab her hand and block her path and ask her why not. She then storms away and begins crying. She comes back with her other girl friend visibly upset. I tell her I’m sorry for upsetting her and I leave the party and go back to my flat as I didn’t want to create any drama and ruin the atmosphere. She then video calls me and tells me she’s coming to my flat. I meet her in the corridor and she says to go to my room. We’re lying on the bed just talking about random stuff and our friends come and check on us and then they leave. 

I start drinking some vodka toffee on my side. She goes into the toilet and says she feels sick, so I offer to hold her hair back( like I’ve done plenty of times beforehand). There was once a time she was so drunk that I had to carry her home. She tells me to get out as she doesn’t want me to see her throwing up, which I assumed was weird as I’ve seen her throw up before. Anyways, I just sit by the door and I’m not really hearing her throw up, so I walk in and then sit next to her. She gives me a hug and then lies on my chest. She tells me I’m comfy. We get into the bed and she asks for one of my shirts as she likes sleeping in a shirt, so I comply. We’re giggling and laughing and having banter and then we start snuggling in bed. I start escalating on her like the seduction posts I’ve read. She’s obliging and next minute we’re kissing each other on the neck and dry humping. I try to kiss her on the lips but she turns her head away, so I ask why, she tells me she’ll catch feelings, so I kiss her on the cheek, which she then says “you’d be so good”, idk about you, but I took that as a continue… I continue to kiss her on the neck and she’s also kissing me back. I have a foot fetish. She doesn’t know, but we’ve joked in the past about her not knowing my fetish. So, I decide to show her, so I take off her socks and start massaging her feet. She’s moaning and saying it feels good. I then start sucking on her foot and she says “why does it feel so good? “. She’s lying back and then I pull out my penis and start rubbing my penis on her foot. I then tell her I’m about to cum and she tells me to stop, so I stop and we both fall asleep. We both wake up a little while later and I start rubbing her stomach with circular motions and slowly and slowly keep going lower until I reach her vagina, I start rubbing her from outside her underwear. I then start fingering her, and she’s moaning and seems like she’s having a good time. I then move and start eating her out. Now, keep in my mind, I’m pretty inexperienced still. So she tells me “ do it in a circular motion, it’s way better “. I comply, she’s moaning and saying “ awh fuck “ whilst her legs are wrapped around my head. I ask her if she wants to have sex and I don’t get a clear response because her arm is over her mouth and I ask again, still no clear response, so I continue what I’m doing and she tells me to stop, so I stop. We then both fall asleep, the next morning I’m joking about with her saying we’re friends with benefits, she leaves after a bit and then tell me that can’t happen again, so I agree. The day after, I ask her to go library and she’s being off, I ask her what’s wrong and she says I took advantage her…

Now, in my mind, I didn’t think I had done. As soon as she said it, I was convinced I did nothing wrong. I told friend A, who originally took my side, but then switched later and comforted her. People were constantly trying to convince me what I did was wrong, but I was so confused, I couldn’t understand. She claims she was super drunk and couldn’t remember anything. Logically, we didn’t drink that much. She told her boyfriend, who wasn’t supportive and hated her, so I thought maybe she said this to make her seem innocent. She said she wasn’t going to the police. A week or so later, she’s hanging out in the group again and wants to be civilised. We all go out clubbing again, she gets drunk, we dance, she then later starts asking me why I would do it and calling me a monster. I was so depressed. Like genuinely, I’ve never been so sad in my whole life. I would never intentionally take advantage of a woman. But I did? I did it by accident you could say. I never knew she was that drunk. “Surely it’s obvious when someone is too drunk far past consent?”. Well, turns out that her and another friend went out and her other friend didn’t even know she was drunk when she was wasted.

Eventually, everyone in the group found out. They all despised me. They hated my guts. Most didn’t even hear my side of the story. But, do I even have a side? Technically, I’m a rapist. 

Well, anyways, a month after the incident, I’m back in my home country and she calls me up saying we need to talk about it and she says she sees the grey area and that she knows I’m not a bad person and I didn’t mean any harm. So, we go back to being friends. Oh, but the whole group still hated me at this point, and they start to hate her, and think she’s lying about the whole thing. We become really good friends again and then when I head back to university, she ghosts me, so I decide to not be her friend and delete her off everything.

I’m doing a lot better now. There were many sleepless nights. But, right now, I’m good.

The day after, I ask her to go library and she’s being off, I ask her what’s wrong and she says I took advantage her…

Now, in my mind, I didn’t think I had done. As soon as she said it, I was convinced I did nothing wrong. I told friend A, who originally took my side, but then switched later and comforted her. People were constantly trying to convince me what I did was wrong, but I was so confused, I couldn’t understand. She claims she was super drunk and couldn’t remember anything. Logically, we didn’t drink that much. She told her boyfriend, who wasn’t supportive and hated her, so I thought maybe she said this to make her seem innocent. She said she wasn’t going to the police. A week or so later, she’s hanging out in the group again and wants to be civilised. We all go out clubbing again, she gets drunk, we dance, she then later starts asking me why I would do it and calling me a monster. I was so depressed. Like genuinely, I’ve never been so sad in my whole life. I would never intentionally take advantage of a woman. But I did? I did it by accident you could say. I never knew she was that drunk. “Surely it’s obvious when someone is too drunk far past consent?”. Well, turns out that her and another friend went out and her other friend didn’t even know she was drunk when she was wasted.

Eventually, everyone in the group found out. They all despised me. They hated my guts. Most didn’t even hear my side of the story. But, do I even have a side? Technically, I’m a rapist. 

Well, anyways, a month after the incident, I’m back in my home country and she calls me up saying we need to talk about it and she says she sees the grey area and that she knows I’m not a bad person and I didn’t mean any harm. So, we go back to being friends. Oh, but the whole group still hated me at this point, and they start to hate her, and think she’s lying about the whole thing. We become really good friends again and then when I head back to university, she ghosts me, so I decide to not be her friend and delete her off everything.

I’m doing a lot better now. There were many sleepless nights. But, right now, I’m good.

19618,ae2kgu,post,One of my best friends was raped by her brother and I failed to help her,"I’ve been friends with her for well over a year now and we’ve both helped each other through our toughest points. We started to grow a little more apart recently but we still care about each other. 

A few days ago she told me that she was raped by her brother. This is not her first time being sexually assaulted, but it’s never been like this. She may also now have HIV and is having to be tested.

I didn’t know what to do or what to say or how to help. I’ve never heard of anything like this happening to anyone I’ve ever known and I had no idea how to react. I stayed and talked with her for a while about it and but couldn’t find anything to say. I’m now worried about her, as she also struggles with depression and I’m afraid she may do something extreme.

Despite worrying and feeling horrible, I haven’t helped her. I haven’t talked to her since she told me and generally don’t know what to do. What can I do in a scenario like this? She’s taking legal action and her already complicated and divided family is now in even more of a downward spiral, and I want to help. She’s reaching out for help. But I didn’t provide any. All I’ve been thinking about is what I should have said and how I could have made her feel better. God, I didn’t even ask her what I could do.

I’m now concerned for her life and cannot live with myself if I don’t do more to help.","One of my best friends was raped by her brother and I failed to help her I’ve been friends with her for well over a year now and we’ve both helped each other through our toughest points.

19621,ab4lhh,post,Sexually assaulted girl I barely knew during an outdoor trip,"Details will be sparse here to protect my identity. 

&#x200B;

This all started when I signed up for a hiking trip and started getting to know all the people in the group I'd be with. I was cool with most of them, but there was one person who I shared a lot of interests with and seemed all around pretty cool. We became decently good friends, and this continued when we actually transitioned to the trip instead of just doing prep and seeing each other around, etc. She was cute, but I had the attitude of ""If something happens, I'm cool with it, if not I'm cool with being friends"" which is pretty standard for me. 

&#x200B;

A few days in, we were going to sleep in the tent and she happened to be in the sleeping bag next to me. Still nothing was different really, except as we were going to sleep I start to feel a feeling like a finger lightly stroking my side. I was a little surprised by this, but I was ok with it, and it was pitch dark and everyone else was also going to sleep so I figured it was just a convenient time/place for her to send that message. So I basically got up closer next to her, kindof imitating the same thing, etc. Nothing really extreme, but still completely inappropriate contact under normal conditions. 

&#x200B;

So the kicker you've been waiting for is that this contact I was ""reciprocating"" wasn't actually initiated; it was just my brain pretty much imagining some random stimulus. My brain assigned the cause of that stimulus to her because, well, I wanted that to be the case I guess. I also know it couldn't have been anyone else since I was on the edge of the tent, and there's no way anything or anyone else could've been at a position to do that. I didn't even realize this was the case, though, until the next morning when I woke up and smiled at her, only to have her look at me with this disgusted look. 

&#x200B;

Didn't take me too long to piece together the horror of what I'd just done, but by then she was already further away from everyone else and being visibly upset about it, to everyone else's bewilderment. I felt and continue to feel an immense load of guilt for that look, demeanor, all of it. I caused that, singlehandedly. Up until that point in my life I'd never done anything I'd consider hurtful, but this changed that record (and by extension my life) forever. I wanted to explain, but what is there to say? Who would believe that explanation that sounds for all the world like clutching at straws? So I just said I was sorry, really, really sorry. It didn't do much, if anything, for either of us, but it's the best I have. 

&#x200B;

Now I'm still involved with the original organization I took the trip with, but obviously this memory looms over me quite a bit as I try to be a role model. Whenever I see her around I just try to avoid eye contact and have us go our separate ways, but it often ends up being more awkward since trying to tell yourself ACT NATURAL is a pretty easy way to act unnaturally. I think quite often about how much harm I've done through my selfishness in making an assumption and not asking for consent, as well as the fact that she has the ability (and perhaps the right) to pretty much destroy my life at any point if she chooses to come forth with this. I try to avoid thinking about negative or destructive thoughts but this memory and all its implications override that rule more often than not. It's not fun but it's my mistake to live with.

&#x200B;

Moral of the story is ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS ask consent, and if you are in a situation where you ""can't"" ask consent verbally then don't do anything at all because it's simply not worth risking it.","Sexually assaulted girl I barely knew during an outdoor trip Details will be sparse here to protect my identity.

19623,a2kmkt,post,Self mutilation,"Since my early teen years I have had various ways of mutilating myself. One thing I think everyone can relate to is being bullied and the effects it leaves on someone mentally. My case wasn't typical in any sense. I was bullied in many different forms. I've had concussions, lacerations and a sexual assault. In my junior year of high school, I had finally reached my capacity for it. Since 1st grade I was bullied and I dont know how I made it as far as I did. I went to Job Corps and one weekend I went home to visit family. I had just gone through a bad breakup, where my ex had aborted our child behind my back and tried to hide it from me by saying  she miscarried. I was at home in my room, in the basement of my families house. I prayed to God and asked him to take the pain away and help me find peace. My first mutilation came in the form of a cross, which I carved into my hand with a hot blade. It left a very distinguished scar on my hand and I try to make it a symbol of my faith and to stay strong. But it led to more and more mutilations. I bite my fingernails down as far as I can until they bleed, I rip my toenails off then clean and bandage them. I've hit myself, smashed my head into things, I even go as far as to dislocate my kneecaps. I am now speaking with a psychologist who has put me on some psychotropic medications to try and help my diagnosis with Bipolar disorder, Major depressive disorder and Anxiety. It took a lot for me to write this and if anyone out there is in a similar situation, know that you are not alone.","Self mutilation Since my early teen years I have had various ways of mutilating myself.

19624,a2i43w,post,I sexually assaulted my best friend and love of my life,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons.

We had good chemistry, and I loved spending every moment with her, and her the same. I would do literally anything for her. One night she got drunk at a party, and called me at 4 in the morning to pick her and her friends up. We had kind of fought the night before about how she just wanted to be friends for now, and that she did love me, but she couldn’t handle a relationship. I was fine with that, but her calling me at 4 in the morning to pick her up was a bit agitating so I was grumpy about the whole thing. When I finally brought her and her friends back to her dorm, she could tell I was annoyed with her, but I kept insisting I was fine. She said she’d suck my dick if that made me happy, but I told her that I didn’t want that and besides, she’d be mad in the morning. We went back up to her dorm and she kept insisting on doing sexual favors and I kept insisting “I’m not mad at you, I’m fine”. She eventually asked me to fuck her, and I said the same “no, you’re drunk, and you’ll just be pissed in the morning”. After asking me twice she just goes “What do I have to do for consent? Take your dick and put it in me myself?” Which threw me off entirely. My poor choice of my entire life was to finger her, which just made her want me more and I ended up having sex with her.

We hung out like normal for the next three days, but I felt awful and I knew what i did was wrong, but I didn’t know how to talk to her about it. She had me come over to her dorm at the end of the three days, gave me all of my crap, and told me she never wanted to see me again and that she knew what happened.

I told her everything that happened, but it doesn’t make what happened any better. What I did was awful, and I regret it literally every day. She has a new boyfriend now, and I’m happy for her. I know he’ll treat her better than I ever can and that’s the only thing that keeps me going.","I sexually assaulted my best friend and love of my life Throwaway account for obvious reasons.

I was got a long well with this girl in class and started groping, fondling her. Not just her ass or breasts but her vagina as well. She never consented to anything I did but she never said NO or pushed me away. She just let it happen. I do regret doing this but her strangely accepting stance on this has me conflicted. She has never spoken about it to me or anyone else and we're even closer friends than ever. I've changed over the years and wouldn't dare do such things again without consent. As much as what I did was bad, could it be that she enjoyed it?

EDIT: She wasn't a shy girl at all. By far the most vocal and capable of soul destroying insults even her own mother who was a teacher got insulted in front of the entire class. As a result most guys in our class wouldn't touch her with a 10 foot pole. Was it because I was the only one guy who gave her attention?","I'm best friends with a girl I sexually assaulted often in High school.

19626,9za645,post,"In my first year of college I had devised a plan to drug and rape a girl, and it didn't work so I didn't go through with it.","God I can't believe I am actually typing this out, but here we go. 

In my first year of college, 1993, I was a depressed, angry, ugly kid. All of the people around me were getting laid and I was just doing nothing basically. I attempted suicide halfway through the year, survived and nobody but me knew about the attempt. It wasn't just that year, I had built up depression for years before that. I was a fucking creep back then, I didn't give a single shit about anyone but myself, I spied on girls and took pictures of them and jerked off to their photos. Sometimes I wonder if I had been born just 15 years later, would I have been the type of kid to shoot up a school? It wasn't even in my mind at the time because it wasn't popularized by the media, but when I think at my mindset back then... I was at the very least at a high risk for some shit like that. 

I didn't really have friends but I had my roommates who were sort of popular. 2 of them were talking about how this guy got a girl really wasted off of anti anxiety medications that he bought from him and fucked her while she was basically passed out. This was 1993, and they thought that was cool to do. The whole entire anti sexual assault campaigns had barely even begun, and guys did a lot of scummy stuff back then which was just seen as normalized. Frat guys would basically brag about rape casually, it was a bad time. 

So I bought a bunch of the anti anxiety meds, didn't say what I was gonna use them for. My plan was to put like 5 of them in a drink, wait for it to dissolve, then ask a girl I knew if she wanted to have a beer chugging contest and she would chug the whole thing. Then when she was starting to pass out or feel nauseous, I would take her to the bathroom and rape her, forcefully if I had to. I was really, really fucked up in the head. I can't even like think about the mindset I had back then, it was just constant anger and hatred for everyone around me, including myself. Its weird because when I try to think about how I devised the plan, I cant remember thinking ""what about her?"" at all, I just thought about myself. I just wanted to experience sex finally, any way possible.

It didn't work. I went to a party, put the pills in the drink, but the drink looked horrible and I took a sip and it was painfully obvious it was not only beer. It tasted horrible. I just gave up. But I would have continued with my plan if it didn't taste terrible. That terrifies me, the idea that I likely would have done it. Funny enough, I went back to the party and actually had a fun time. It was the first party I had ever been to where I had fun. And that also disturbs me, because I was having fun even though I had just spent 2 days devising a plan to rape one of the people at the party. 

Anyways, I attempted suicide again about 6 months after, this time when I was back home for the summer. Parents found out, sent me to therapy, loads of it. I lost 50 pounds. Went on anti depressants for a while but quit because they were making me gain the weight back. I just had a much, much healthier mindset when I went back to college. I also got a girlfriend soon after. Really the two years following that were sort of me crawling out of the dark hole I put myself in mentally. 

Anyways I am married with kids now. Nobody but me knows. I actually blocked this out of my memory for years until just now.

19627,9yndoo,post,Unsure whether I committed sexual assault in high school (four years ago) and unsure whether to reach out and apologize,"I am now in college and the incidents in question happened my junior year in high school (four years ago), just when I started to drink. Because I was drunk and these incidents happened a few years ago, I'm hazy on the details (which worries me). I don't want to have too big of a preface to this so I'll just get down to describing the situations:

1. I was at a party and very drunk. I was talking in a group of people I knew, including one girl who was a somewhat  friend of mine. I believe she was also drunk and she was having a bad time and was complaining about something that I can't remember. While we were talking a guy started feeling her ass and she responded with ""yeah you can touch my ass, that's totally fine."" At the time, I thought that she was saying anyone could touch her ass, so I proceeded to touch her ass. I can't quite remember but I believe the other guy was feeling her ass too. This continued for about 30 seconds-1 minute, and at one point she turned to me with some sort of scared face. I did not know how to read this face and I can't quite remember it now. At the time, I thought that her face was expressing distress about whatever she was complaining about earlier. Regardless, I stopped touching her ass at that point. In retrospect, I feel like she was being ironic when she said that the guy could touch her ass or that she was only telling him that HE could feel her ass and that it wasn't an open invitation. I believe I misread the situation. She continued to be friends with me afterwards. A year after this incident, she even followed my private instagram account only for close friends (finsta) and commented that she was happy we were following each other's accounts (paraphrasing here). Even though she seemed friendly with me afterwards, I don't think that necessarily means that I did not sexually assault her. I thought that what I was doing was okay but because she does not know my thought process of why I touched her like that, I still could have caused her tremendous hurt.
2. I was at another party in junior year, and I was drunk. I was talking with this girl in a crowd of people and I wasn't sure if she was coming on to me or not, but now I don't think that she was. I ended up wrapping my arms around her waist and kissing her rather abruptly. We made out for a few seconds, and then she pulled away. I don't remember her looking scared or anything but she was clearly not into it. I do remember apologizing to her, but in a very drunk way. It was something like ""Sorry you're very attractive"" with stupid drunk giggling or something. She also continued to be friendly with me after the incident and I even heard from other people that she wanted me to ask her to prom (I ended up going with someone else).

I talked to my best friend (who is a girl) about this and she insisted that I was overthinking both situations. She assured me that I was a good person and that I'm always trying to find things to prove that I am a bad person. She said I sounded insane digging into my past like this. While I am a huge overthinker, I worry that her view of me is biased because she thinks I'm such a good person and I met her in college so she does not know either of these women. I do very much care about the issues of women now but I feel like I wasn't as aware of these issues in high school. Part of what prompted me to worrying about these incidents was the brett kavanaugh investigations and I did not feel comfortable criticizing him if I was potentially just as bad as him. I feel like a hypocrite for supporting feminist causes. I would not act the same way as I did in high school and I don't think that these moments were appropriate. BUT, even if I am a ""better"" person now, I never faced any consequences for my actions and I feel like the me too movement stresses accountability. I recognize that a huge part of me worrying about these incidents is because I want to be a good person, and it is therefore selfish. But I also truly feel bad if I were to hurt these women in any way. I have been somewhat coerced into sex with someone who I did not want to have sex with (another incident in the grey area of sexual assault) and I do not wish that feeling upon anyone else.

&#x200B;

I now have a girlfriend who is also very supportive of feminist causes and I worry that, by telling her these incidents, she will never see me the same again. I do want to get her advice on the issue, however. I feel guilty even writing this point without telling her that I'm worried about it.

&#x200B;

I'll close with two questions:

1. Do you think these incidents qualify as sexual assault? Or am I overthinking this?
2. Do you think I should reach out to apologize to these two people? Would it help ease their potential pain in any way? Or would it just be selfish of me?

19628,9xihpq,post,I Sexually Harassed a Girl When I Was a 6th Grader,"We all learn about sex when we are in elementary school. For me, though, I learned about it much earlier. I was first introduced to porn when I was 7 years old.

I genuinely can’t even remember where or how I came across it, but I did. I continued watching it for many many years. I still do, in fact.

But one thing porn doesn’t really teach you is the law. Aside from the occasional intro text saying “All models are 18 and older”, I knew nothing else.

By 6th grade, I unfortunately knew the act of sex very well. Years of watching that kind of stuff teaches you a bit. What I didn’t know were the laws about sex.

I knew the basic stuff like rape being illegal and stuff like that, but I didn’t know what sexual harassment/assault were or that they were illegal.

Well there was a girl in 7th grade that I knew from the year before that walked the way I walked home from school.

The middle school bus (which came from a middle school many miles away) would drop the 7th and 8th graders off at the elementary school and have them walk home.

Fair enough.

Well I would harass this girl almost every day after school. I would say things like “Hey, sugartits!” “Nice ass!” and way worse things that I can’t really remember.

I knew these things were not ok to say to her. I thought they were frowned upon, but I had no idea what I was doing was a literal crime. I don’t know what the fuck was going through my head. I just felt a push or an urge to say them.

Well she went and told the vice principal about it. The day I got called in, I played dumb. I said “No. I don’t know who you’re talking about.” The school LET ME OFF WITH NO REPERCUSSIONS. Nothing on my record or anything.

I stopped talking to her because I didn’t want to get in trouble, but I still waved at her sarcastically and I would wink at her.

If you look through the paperwork, the whole thing was forgotten about, but the paper isn’t always right.

About 7 months ago, I woke up in the middle of the night after having a dream, more like a flashback, to the terrible things I said to this girl.

I had completely forgotten about it since it had happened so long ago (more than 10 years ago). 

Since I remembered it, I can’t unremember it. 

For the past 7 months, I have been searching on social media trying to find this girl and ask her for forgiveness, but I’ve had no luck so far.

I’ve since then developed insomnia and a deep hatred for myself. I am having such a hard time forgiving MYSELF for the things I’ve done. 

I know that if I were to ever meet her again, I would burst into tears and beg for her to forgive me. I know for sure she hasn’t forgotten it.

I’m sorry if this post goes all around the place, but my mind has been going in a million different directions this year.

To Miranda, if you’re reading this, I am so sorry. You have no idea how much I regret the things I did those many years ago. I hope that if this ever reaches you, you can find it in your heart to forgive me.","I Sexually Harassed a Girl When I Was a 6th Grader We all learn about sex when we are in elementary school.

19629,9s8byk,post,"I was kicked out of a bar after trying to kiss my friend. I looked up sexual assault, and now I hate myself","I went out to a bar with Adam, Adam and I got drunk at Bar 1, and went to Bar 2. I was messaging my friend Hayley, and she was in town. I hadn't seen her since I'd been and gone from the country, so figured I'd go say hello. When I got there I bought us a drink. We were sat super close together and I misread the signals, I proceeded out to the smoking area and she came with me. We were talking and something in my mind said 'kiss her'. I went in for a kiss, and she leaned back. Told me it wasn't going to happen. I tried again. And drunkenly mumbled something about how it means nothing, and that we're both drunk. Or something. I don't know, it must have been disgusting to hear. I don't think we ever actually kissed. I just tried. I might have kissed her neck or something, I don't know. I was so drunk. 

&#x200B;

We then went inside, she walked ahead. I didn't realise I'd made her so insanely uncomfortable because I was drunk and being a moron. I didn't read the social queues. She went to the bar, I went up to her and told her I've had a crush on her for ages. She said I know. But no. I don't know what else I said there, I don't remember. I was pretty drunk. 

&#x200B;

We got back to the booth where a bunch of her friends were. I started speaking to the others, having completely forgotten about the last 5 seconds. I don't remember much. Suddenly one of her friends is telling me to fuck off. To get out. She pushed me. I felt confused as hell, so approached Hayley and said ""can you tell your friend to stop being so mean to me?"" and she told me she didn't want to get involved, that it was her friend's night out. So I just packed up my stuff and left. I felt super bad, but couldn't figure out why. 

&#x200B;

I woke up the next morning and immediately understood. I felt fucking terrible. I **feel** fucking terrible. I sent her a message and apologised - I didn't make any excuses for myself; that I was drunk or whatever. I just said sorry. She said thanks for apologising, and told me that she doesn't want to see or hear from me for a while. That she felt gross. She thought we were friends, and she'd made it clear to me that she wasn't interested but I kept trying. Then I felt gross, and I should. I have become the perpetrator of a behaviour I always hated hearing about from friends who'd experienced it.  I wonder how many times I've done this in the past - that is make someone feel uncomfortable or unsafe. I can't stop thinking about how I've burnt this friendship to the ground. I totally objectified someone I supposedly considered a friend. I ruined someone's night.   


I don't like typing this up. I feel like a bad person, and will likely feel like a bad person for a long time. I don't know how to reconcile this. She's blocked me on Twitter and Instagram, I won't reach out to her. I think that'd be worse. I have apologised, but I know there's nothing else I can do, or should even try to do. 

&#x200B;

I really hate myself right now. I don't want to drink anymore. I hate myself. I need to get my mind right. Has anyone been here before? What should I do? Should I just confess this to people I know? Will that make me feel better? Will I lose friends? Am I a bad person?

19630,9qwntg,post,"Not sure if I cheated on my boyfriend, or was sexually assaulted."," 

tl;dr: I can't remember if I had consensual sex with someone and cheated on my boyfriend or was sexually assaulted.

There is a backstory here that has too many intricacies to cover fully. So I'll just start from the beginning of the night. 

I was promoting an event with a few of my friends last weekend. This night I had decided to not do any MDMA or Cocaine as my boyfriend (let's call him Jason) was at the event with me. Jason wouldn't judge me for doing any of that, but he doesn't do it and I wanted to enjoy the night with him so I decided to stay on his level. 

A friend who always comes to our event (call him Mark) had a celebration that weekend, and had been drinking all day since 9am. Our event started at around 9pm. About 30 minutes into the event Mark was clearly too high on MDMA. Paired with drinking all day he seemed very out of it. Everyone took a pause from partying, took care of Mark until he was ok again, and continued on with the night. But for that short while, he was very high and people were seriously concerned. 

After the event, around 2 am, we all went to an after party at my friends house. I had driven those friends to the event, so I took everyone back and hung out for a while. My boyfriend didn't come to the afterparty. I don't remember too much of it, except that everyone was jumping in the pool and I was talking to Mark. Just regular conversation. I remember not having fun anymore and asking Mark if he wanted to come back to my house to hang out. 

We got back to my house and Mark had a lot of alcohol. We were just hanging out watching Netflix and drinking. I remembered I had a tiny bit of cocaine left in a bag somewhere and found it. Mark saw it and pulled out a full baggie of cocaine. We did it all. I remember doing bumps and talking. I remember him trying to kiss me and me pushing him off and laughing. I remember fingers inside me. I remember I liked it.

And thats it.

The first thing I said when I woke up was how there was makeup all over my pillow. I was naked from the waist down. I think I went to the bathroom? I had had my period. I had no tampon in. I came back upstairs and Mark was standing up and was naked. I got him to get his stuff together. Looking at what was left, I drank at least a litre of vodka. I drove Mark to his car and came back home. I slept all day.

This happened over the weekend. It's Tuesday night now, and as much as I've tried, I still can't remember any more than that. 

I feel like a piece of shit. I understand that people will say that I was too inebriated to have given consent, but he was worse off than me. It's also completely possible that I was into all of this and I just don't remember because of alcohol and drugs. I made a huge mistake by bringing him into my house, but I have a lot of male friends and it's not irregular for me to have a male friend sleep over, even beside me in my bed, 

Now that I type it out...I see it's his fault. No matter how drunk you are if a person isn't into it you shouldn't just do it anyways. But...I still don't remember the whole event so it's still possible I consented...

Either way. I haven't told anyone else and probably won't.   


  
","Not sure if I cheated on my boyfriend, or was sexually assaulted.  

tl;dr: I can't remember if I had consensual sex with someone and cheated on my boyfriend or was sexually assaulted.

There is a backstory here that has too many intricacies to cover fully. So I'll just start from the beginning of the night. 

I was promoting an event with a few of my friends last weekend. This night I had decided to not do any MDMA or Cocaine as my boyfriend (let's call him Jason) was at the event with me. Jason wouldn't judge me for doing any of that, but he doesn't do it and I wanted to enjoy the night with him so I decided to stay on his level.

19631,9pfc72,post,My ex boyfriend started dating the random girl who helped me after I found out he was cheating,"A few days after my ex and I broke up I decided to go to a party with a few of my friends. A few of his friends showed up, I said hi and continued to socialize. That’s when things started to get blurry. 

I remember one of his friends coming up to me and saying that my ex had been cheating the whole time, and he had already slept with a whole bunch of girls. (All of this turned out to be true) I turned around as I could feel my body going numb and couldn’t find any of my friends. 

A girl that I had seen a few times grabbed my hand and we headed towards the back porch.  She held me while I was completely shaking and assured me that I would be okay and I didn’t deserve what he had done to me. A few people had crowded around, many people giving me their drinks. I barely remember getting in my Uber, and I have no idea how my exes random friend ended up there with me. 

People later told me that he said he lived next to me and that he would get me home okay. Although I never pressed charges, he sexually assaulted me that night. 

It took a VERY long time for me to recover from that night. I reached out and thanked that girl for being there for me when no one else was. She didn’t even know me and saw how completely crushed I was over the guy that I loved for the last two years of my life. I still believe that she is a good person and showed me kindness when I felt that I was alone. 

It wasn’t until a few months later that I stumbled upon her Instagram account. I knew that she was in the same group of friends as all these people, but I didn’t know that she would immediately start dating the guy that I had cried in her arms about. I also had no idea that he would be able to move on so fast after he essentially destroyed me. It still hurts knowing that he was able to do so much with no consequences. He drank alcohol, slept around, and got a new girl friend to recover from us... I was the one who had to build from that night that completely broke me. 

But she was right, I do deserve better. I have so much ahead of me and I am on an amazing life path. I just hope that when he repeats what he did (there’s no doubt in my mind that he will) that she will realize that she deserves better too.

19633,9ovbya,post,I’m 20 yo and I’ve never had a real relationship,"I’m 20 (F) and I’ve never had a real boyfriend. Most of the time it doesn’t bother me but every now and then I get lonely when I think about it. And it’s not that I just need someone to talk to or to cuddle or to have sex with. Sure all those things are great but I really want to find my “soul mate” if that’s even a real thing (I hope it is   I’ve always enjoyed the idea). I know I’m still young but it’s hard not to feel a little lonely at times when you see that kind of love all around you. I had a “boyfriend” my junior year of high school that dumped me over text after about a month that was my first kiss and only “boyfriend”. 

After high school I fell for a coworker but he only wanted FWB even gave me the “let’s not label this yet” but I was so “in love” I gave him my virginity. When he still felt the same way afterwards it broke my heart (I guess I thought sex would change his mind lol) and I took some time to myself and eventually realized I was going to be okay and I didn’t even want to be friends with him (he was a dick just didn’t realize until afterwards of course love is blind as they say). 

Thinking it would help me get over heartbreak went to tinder slept with a guy who sexually assaulted me (took the condom off in the middle among other little things that just put me off) didn’t realize that’s what it was until a month later btw and after seeing him two more times. I know. Dumb. Luckily nothing like that first time happened again and I just stopped seeing him because as you can imagine I didn’t have a good feeling about this guy even tho through text this guy seemed great but something was just off about him.

SIDE NOTE- I have been tested I’m all clean thank god but after that first time when I felt disgusted with myself and talking(texting)to him about it I told myself I should give him another chance which was stupid in hindsight especially in such a situation. I’m just lucky nothing worse happened.

Funny/weird side note- every time no joke EVERYTIME we had just finished having sex he would do a yogi bear impression 

Later on gave another coworker/friend who was really sweet a chance (very short period of time) but didn’t have those feelings toward him and talked about it with him and we ended it on good terms he turned into an asshole started talking shit about me to other coworkers and showed his true colors of how childish he was. He transferred to a diff store and I later on quit. Both for different reasons atleast my quitting was. 

That’s all of my experience or tales of almost boyfriends . It kinda sucks that I can’t even call my “first love” an official ex but oh well. I just get lonely sometimes and fun fact I’ve never had a valentine. More discounted chocolate for me feb 15th :D D’:

19634,9ou6st,post,"My son was accused of sexual assault and I defended him publicly, knowing that he most likely did it.","My son was always a good looking kid, very handsome. He got an offer from a modeling agency at 18 and we were all so excited. 

&#x200B;

When he was 21 (this was around 2009) he got accused of sexual assault. Then two other girls came forward and said that he also tried to sexually assault them, and was incredibly forceful and creepy with them. 

&#x200B;

My son said that the girls were trying to 'bring him down' over a contract that he got that was supposed to go to someone else. I wasn't quite sure of the specifics, but I just readily accepted what he told me without any second thought. I told everyone that the girls were liars, and that they were just out to get my son. Our cousins, family friends, aunts and uncles, they all heard about it, and I was always the first one to go and tell them it was a lie and that my son would never do that and the girls were just trying to bring my son down because he was so much more successful than them. 

&#x200B;

The thing is... deep down, I knew that the girls were most likely right. My son had girls over, a lot, growing up. I can't even count the amount of girls he brought over and introduced as his 'girlfriend' in senior year. I can mostly hear what goes on in his room from my library study, and on THREE occasions, not just once, I remember him trying to forcefully pressure a girl to do stuff with him. Being extremely pushy and telling them to just 'stop acting weird' or 'just relax'. I remember hearing the girls tell him no, over and over again. I remember on two occasions the girls said 'stop touching me' or something similar. On one occasion the girl stormed out, hysterically crying. I always tried to erase those memories from my mind, I thought maybe I just misinterpreted what was happening in the room, and maybe it wasn't that bad. There was just \*no way\* that my son could by that type of person. There was another incident, at his cousins wedding, where he was VERY adamant about flirting with this girl who was there, to the point where it was making her uncomfortable. I remember two people had to tell him to stop talking to her, because he was being too forceful and creepy. 

&#x200B;

But when the girls at the agency accused him of sexual assault I just buried those memories so deep into my brain that they basically never came up. It didn't matter, he got fired from the agency either way. 

&#x200B;

He got married the year after. We were so excited for him. Then literally only 7 months later we found out his wife was in a women shelter, because he was beating her and abusing her. Of course he told us differently, that she was just in a hotel, and that they were having marital troubles. That was just... the last straw. It sort of all came back to me, all of the pieces connected at once, everything made sense. \*My son was, and is, a piece of shit\*. I stopped denying it constantly and just accepted it. 

&#x200B;

I feel a lot of regret about defending him when those poor girls came out saying he sexually assault them. It wouldn't matter in the end because he lost his job either way, but just the personal feeling of giving him vindication. 

&#x200B;

I stopped speaking to him after we found out about what his ex wife went through. After a long and lengthy court case, he went to jail. He only just got out last year. We still haven't spoken.

19635,9oadlc,post,When I was thirteen or so I started sneaking into my mom's bedroom when she was out and I'd lick her dildos. (Among other things),"[No Regrets]

I don't know why, but I've always been sexual, even as a younger boy. I was obsessed with sex and the body when I was young (I still am to an extent, but nothing this fucked up) and I would go and put my mom's porn dvds on and lick and suck on her dildos while I masturbated. I would even go as far as trying to use them on myself and when it didn't work I would turn the vibration on and rest it againt my asshole while I jerked off. I would also insert her silver bullet vibrator into my as and jerk off like that.

I have no clue why I'm such a deviant when it comes to sex/sexual urges. I don't remember any trauma that would have caused it or anything. I just know I've always been fucked in the head when it comes to sex. (Not that I'd ever assault anyone or anything, I'm not detached or psycho.)
But when I was young, like 6-8 before I knew it was wrong or even a thing, I would touch my mom or grandmother while I slept beside them. (That actually started with me sniffing their used tampons and stuff.) 

It only happened with my mom once, because she woke up and shamed me about it in front of my sisters (actually that may be what imprinted my incest kink now that I think about it) and I've always worried that it permanently changed how they think about me.

So yeah, that's the first time I've ever shared that at all and fuck me does it make me look like a total nut. Geeze.

19636,9nt35l,post,I witnessed a “sexual assault” in kindergarten,"Just using an alt. account as I don’t want to associate this with my main. 

Just for context, I don’t know if other countries outside of Australia have it, but kindergarten is basically pre-school. 

This happened when I was about 6 or 7, in the early 2000’s. The memory is faint, but as I’ve gotten older, it’s bothered me more and more, primarily as I begin to realise how fucked up it was. 

In our kindergarten, there was, as with any pre-school type place, a pretty decent sized playground. At the front of the playground, furthest from the building and where the teachers would supervise, was a large group of shrubbery. 

What I remember is a group of maybe 8 boys, same age as me, taking a girl, same age, into these bushes and stripping her naked. She clearly was not contempt with it, as any person would be, and screamed, but the boys just kept on going at it. What I remember distinctly is one of the boys touching her genitalia, running away, hiding, and then coming back and do it again, as if it’s a game. It disgusts me. I think, from memory, is that I was kinda of there, but just standing back, while they stripped and touched this young girl. Obviously I was naive and didn’t understand what was going on.

However, while I feel utmost disgust, I also feel small pride, as somehow, despite my youthful innocence, I understood what was going on and told the teacher. That’s where my recollection stops.

The memory completely left my mind until the last few years. I’ve never told my parents. I don’t even think the kindergarten told my parents. I think I’ve brought it up to my friends occasionally, just completely thinking over it. But now, I just feel disgust.

I put sexual assault in apostrophes because I struggle to wrap my mind around it. I don’t not know it was. What scares me is that these boys didn’t understand what they were doing, and might’ve scarred this girl for life. What scares me more, however, is if they did. 

I can’t remember the particular people involved, but I do think I remember the girl. If I’m right about who it is, I’ve spoken to them recently, and they seem fine, but you never know how deeply such an event may traumatise them. 

This just continually haunts me. I think it was a defining moment in my life without me even knowing it. And the seriousness of it, as I learnt how what sexual assault and rape is later in life, just makes me wonder if this was it. If this was “sexual assault”. It scares me, and it makes me feel so uncomfortable. 
","I witnessed a “sexual assault” in kindergarten Just using an alt. account as I don’t want to associate this with my main. 

Just for context, I don’t know if other countries outside of Australia have it, but kindergarten is basically pre-school. 

This happened when I was about 6 or 7, in the early 2000’s. The memory is faint, but as I’ve gotten older, it’s bothered me more and more, primarily as I begin to realise how fucked up it was. 

In our kindergarten, there was, as with any pre-school type place, a pretty decent sized playground. At the front of the playground, furthest from the building and where the teachers would supervise, was a large group of shrubbery. 

What I remember is a group of maybe 8 boys, same age as me, taking a girl, same age, into these bushes and stripping her naked. She clearly was not contempt with it, as any person would be, and screamed, but the boys just kept on going at it. What I remember distinctly is one of the boys touching her genitalia, running away, hiding, and then coming back and do it again, as if it’s a game. It disgusts me. I think, from memory, is that I was kinda of there, but just standing back, while they stripped and touched this young girl. Obviously I was naive and didn’t understand what was going on.

However, while I feel utmost disgust, I also feel small pride, as somehow, despite my youthful innocence, I understood what was going on and told the teacher. That’s where my recollection stops.

The memory completely left my mind until the last few years. I’ve never told my parents. I don’t even think the kindergarten told my parents. I think I’ve brought it up to my friends occasionally, just completely thinking over it. But now, I just feel disgust.

I put sexual assault in apostrophes because I struggle to wrap my mind around it. I don’t not know it was. What scares me is that these boys didn’t understand what they were doing, and might’ve scarred this girl for life. What scares me more, however, is if they did. 

I can’t remember the particular people involved, but I do think I remember the girl. If I’m right about who it is, I’ve spoken to them recently, and they seem fine, but you never know how deeply such an event may traumatise them. 

This just continually haunts me. I think it was a defining moment in my life without me even knowing it. And the seriousness of it, as I learnt how what sexual assault and rape is later in life, just makes me wonder if this was it. If this was “sexual assault”. It scares me, and it makes me feel so uncomfortable.

19638,9ma03m,post,Mistreated friends of mine and can't get over it. not sure if confessing helps.,"Hi All,

i  can't get over three major events in my life. it's one thing to face  things I've suffered, but i find it hard to confront the wrongs i've done towards others.

One event can be described this way (a letter i want to send to this person):

>Hey.  I know you’ve unfriended me, so I’ll be brief. I’ve spent years  wondering how I might have wronged you and I think about the night the  condom came off, and I told you as soon as I knew. I’m so sorry for not  having been more responsible, for not being more supportive. And the  night after, you came to visit me and I was excited to see you for the  wrong reasons. I was a little too touchy when it seemed you didn’t want  to be touched, when we were talking on my bed and you seemed to want to  tell me something and I was trying to touch your boobs instead. It’s a  little blurry to me now, but I’m so sorry if I ever disrespected or  violated your boundaries. I didn’t know how to approach you and I tried  my best to respect your space afterwards. I’m sorry for texting you when  you didn’t want to be texted.  
I also  remember you telling me some days after the fact that you were at least  tipsy the night we had sex. If I’d known beforehand I would never have  gone through with it. You seemed to me to fully consent at the time, and  you walked down the stairs okay, and we had full conversations during,  and I’m so sorry if I fucked up there. I should have asked. We both  seemed enthusiastic. I’ve run it over a million times in my head since  and I’m so sorry.  
I wanted to apologize. I should have been a better friend and human being and my head wasn’t in the right place. I’m so sorry.

what  happened above \^ was at least five years ago and it hurts as if it  happened yesterday.  so that's one.  (is that an ok letter to send? i  don't even know if i should send it at all...)

and  the second i dont even know how to write. spent a lot of time in  therapy trying to work through it and it never got better. i slept with a  girl who it turned out was very drunk in college, and i asked her if  she was drunk and she said she wasn't so i had sex with her. i've never  been able to fully describe what happened, it scares me just to think  about it. i only realized she was drunk when i texted her the next  morning and she was surprised it was me she had sex with. i apologized  to her and she seemed to forgive me but it doesn't feel like enough...  and i also had a thing with her where i violated her physical boundaries  by being touchy. i only noticed it when one of her friends pointed it  out and i was so upset i went to another college over a thousand miles  away. that was six years ago.

and the  third event, i groped a friend some 8 years ago and i apologized for  that. it still weighs heavily on me. she deserved a much better friend.  obviously our friendship never recovered.

i  was sexually assaulted myself for many years, from childhood onwards,  on a regular basis, and not processing those experiences properly made  me think that's how everyone was supposed to be treated. i feel  sandwiched between my own experiences and what i've done to others. i  like to think i've really come to terms with those experiences and made a  good life to myself, been giving to others, i'm writing a book right  now that's actually promising, but this pain and shame and guilt and  confusion is so in the way i honestly am not sure if i can finish it.  maybe i don't want to finish it. this feels a little narcissistic??, but  maybe part of it has to do with this kind of stuff getting out, or me  being open about it, and then being despised, hated, going to jail???...  i'm scared. i'm also trying not to be attention-seeking, not to make  this about me when i know these are about wrongs others have experienced  as a result of my actions. i'm sorry to anyone reading this if there is  anything attention-seeking in here, please point it out to me if you  see it. i've tried to remove anything that is. the pain im feeling is  intense and it's confused...

i don't know  what to do. and i feel like an asshole because part of why i'm so  suicidal is related to the idea of public humiliation, that it's not  just the 'pure' recognition that i treated people poorly in one way or  another.

19639,9m2d5u,post,I sexually assaulted two of my sisters friends when I was 11-12 years old.,"Hello /r/ confession,

&#x200B;

This is something that happened long ago, and has weighed on my mind to varying degrees ever since. I am 26 now, and am just finishing up my second degree. My life is going well, and I have all good opportunities ahead of me. I am happy with myself, and wouldn't consider myself depressed, angry, or troubled in any major way, except for this. 

&#x200B;

Tonight I ran across a facebook post, following the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh, saying something to the effect of ""raise your hand if you've made it out of highschool without trying to rape another person""... I felt a stupid sense of pride for not having made such a horrible mistake in my life. But then I thought about it, and it hit me harder than a ton of bricks. I \*did\* sexually assault two people. On two separate occasions. I have just gotten over what I believe to be a mild panic attack that was set off by this realization-- \*I can't claim to never have sexually assaulted someone.\* I never thought about it in this way, and I'm horribly, horribly ashamed of myself. I'm ashamed of myself for what I have done, and I am almost equally as ashamed for not having realized that I've repressed this and have kept it to myself for almost two decades. I have, and still do, consider myself a good person. I feign from violence, continually advocate for non-violence, and speak out against sexual assault whenever it comes into discussion like any decent human would do of course. The point is, this is \*very\* unlike me today. 

&#x200B;

This is what happened. I will spare the details. Both times were sleepovers, not too far apart in time. I insisted on sleeping in the same room. We fell asleep together on a large pallet on the floor. At some point in the middle of the night I woke up and touched them, down below, through their clothes. I don't think either of them woke up, but I can't be sure. Both times, it couldn't have been longer than a minute's time span. They were my sisters age, two years younger than me. I'm not sure if I was 11 or 12 at the time, I've sat here and tried to think exactly what year it was but can't think of any definitive way of knowing. I do know that after this has happened, they have never come over again, and my sister, to my knowledge, hasn't really talked to them again. This leads me to believe that they somehow know, but again, nobody has confronted me about this ever. That's it. 

&#x200B;

I've had many wonderful relationships after this. I consider myself gentle with women, and pride myself of it. I've never touched another person sexually without their explicit permission. I've never had the temptation or the plan to do otherwise. I feel very grateful for this.

&#x200B;

I know this isn't a particularly juicy story, and I will say that having this on my mind hasn't been life-altering, but I do feel I needed to tell someone. I felt an immense weight of shame after reading that post and coming to this realization, and decided that I need to tell another person now, or I might not ever. I know how easy it is to deceive yourself. I might shove this back into where it came from, or I might do something about it, which is why I'm here.

&#x200B;

Tonight, I feel ashamed. I feel like I don't deserve to be in a relationship again. Whoever is reading this, I come to you for confession as well as advice. What should I do? Are there any of you who have regrets about your past actions? How have you dealt with your past misdoings? I feel like I should tell a friend, and seek their advice, but I'm not sure yet. Thank you for reading.

There is a problem. So many men have hurt women in countless ways. And so many of these men will never face justice.

&#x200B;

There is a culture of silence among the abusers, their friends, their families, and even the survivors of their abuse. This silence allows abusers to escape the consequences of their actions. They go on with their lives and everything settles back to normal.

&#x200B;

This cannot continue to be normal. 

&#x200B;

The normalization and silencing of sexual violence allows these men to continue streaks of violence and domination, never learning and never caring. And it isn't fair.

&#x200B;

Their actions are excused; they were drunk, they were just roughousing, asking for consent isn't sexy, they misinterpreted signals, etc.

&#x200B;

This is what I told myself and others when I was abusive.

&#x200B;

I never raped anyone, but I tried to twice under the influence of alcohol, both times I was persuaded to stop. Once when I was 15 and once when I was 19.

&#x200B;

Additional details are being omitted out of concern for the survivors. When I told them I was thinking about confessing, they asked me not to provide any details of the story, because they were worried people they knew would begin talking about it. Please do not bother them, I am sure these are not memories they enjoy revisiting. 

&#x200B;

Over the years, I've grown a lot personally and emotionally. My views on so many issues have developed to see the world in a radically different light over the course of just a few years. And I slowly, but surely realized that I had done something so unspeakably horrible. Before, it was just a fact of life - everyone makes mistakes, but now I understand that this is something else. These were not events, but were a product of a culture of toxic masculinity that I had fully bought into. I can only apologize and regret all the awful things I've done and said about women over the past few years. I'm working on it, I really am.

&#x200B;

I have apologized to both women. And I am blessed that I still consider one to be a friend who I can confide in. Everyday I wonder how she can reconcile what I tried to do to her and her wanting to continue interacting with me. I asked her and she didn't know either. 

&#x200B;

Likewise, I don't know how I can consider myself to be a good person in light of what I've done. I've apologized, I've tried to make amends, I try to be a fierce advocate for women today, I've had very healthy relationships with women both platonic and romantic, but it still doesn't feel like that's enough.

&#x200B;

It feels dirty to publicly be an ally, but privately know that there are skeletons kept in the closet by silence. 

&#x200B;

That's why I'm coming clean. I chose to break this culture of silence. Other than the intense feelings of guilt, shame, and regret, I have faced no meaningful repercussions. I spoke at my high school's graduation ceremony, I went to college on a scholarship, I graduated a year early with my degree, I am in grad school, I seem to waltz into employment opportunities with ease.

&#x200B;

I don't believe I deserve the privileges my life has afforded me. I fully realize that by writing this, there is the possibility that it all comes crashing down - that I will experience difficulty finding work or that I will lose friendships and relationships which I cherish. As unpleasant as that is, it pales in comparison to the intense amount of pain and confusion I have caused. If this brings the survivors any comfort, if it helps survivors to be believed, and if it helps to encourage other men out there to rethink their actions, then it will have been worth it.

&#x200B;

A few years ago, after both of those events, one of my friends was going through a bad breakup and we were both drunk, we kissed, and she asked me if I wanted to stay the night with her. I said no because we were drunk and emotionally vulnerable. She thanked me for my restraint the next day and she continues to cite this incident as indicating I am trustworthy to her friends. 

&#x200B;

The amount of pride I feel for that one decent act has been far more fulfilling than any sexual tryst I've had. If I had gone through with it I could never forgive myself for taking advantage of the trust of a friend. 

&#x200B;

I am telling this story because I want to warn all the men out there to treat women, and others, as fellow people instead of objects. 

&#x200B;

If you have done wrong in the past, that will never change, but you can be better now and in the future. Ever since I started telling people this story, it's felt good. 

&#x200B;

And survivors should ALWAYS be believed. Silence is not only common, it is part of the abuse. 

&#x200B;

I want to play a part, even if it's a small one, in breaking the culture of silence. 

&#x200B;

It's the least we can do, as wrongdoing men. ","I've abused women in my past and want to confess publicly but a survivor of my abuse doesn't want me to. I'm confused and don't know what to do.

&#x200B;

That's why I'm coming clean. I chose to break this culture of silence. Other than the intense feelings of guilt, shame, and regret, I have faced no meaningful repercussions. I spoke at my high school's graduation ceremony, I went to college on a scholarship, I graduated a year early with my degree, I am in grad school, I seem to waltz into employment opportunities with ease.

&#x200B;

I don't believe I deserve the privileges my life has afforded me. I fully realize that by writing this, there is the possibility that it all comes crashing down - that I will experience difficulty finding work or that I will lose friendships and relationships which I cherish. As unpleasant as that is, it pales in comparison to the intense amount of pain and confusion I have caused. If this brings the survivors any comfort, if it helps survivors to be believed, and if it helps to encourage other men out there to rethink their actions, then it will have been worth it.

&#x200B;

A few years ago, after both of those events, one of my friends was going through a bad breakup and we were both drunk, we kissed, and she asked me if I wanted to stay the night with her. I said no because we were drunk and emotionally vulnerable. She thanked me for my restraint the next day and she continues to cite this incident as indicating I am trustworthy to her friends. 

&#x200B;

The amount of pride I feel for that one decent act has been far more fulfilling than any sexual tryst I've had. If I had gone through with it I could never forgive myself for taking advantage of the trust of a friend. 

&#x200B;

I am telling this story because I want to warn all the men out there to treat women, and others, as fellow people instead of objects. 

&#x200B;

If you have done wrong in the past, that will never change, but you can be better now and in the future. Ever since I started telling people this story, it's felt good. 

&#x200B;

And survivors should ALWAYS be believed. Silence is not only common, it is part of the abuse. 

&#x200B;

I want to play a part, even if it's a small one, in breaking the culture of silence. 

&#x200B;

It's the least we can do, as wrongdoing men. ",4,28.0,2018-10-07 2:59,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/9m1zw3/ive_abused_women_in_my_past_and_want_to_confess/,Neutral
19641,9m1r3t,post,I don’t know if I influenced a sexual assault and it haunts me to this day.,"

I created a throw away account for obvious reasons.

I’ve (F25) been a victim of multiple sexual assaults through my life. I was molested by a family friend from age 6-9, raped by a stranger on two separate occasions, and have experienced a form of continuous sexual violence during a previously long and very abusive relationship. Now with all the #metoo coming to light, its not only made me more comfortable opening up to my loved ones about the sexual traumas I’ve experienced, but it’s also caused me to  look back at my actions wondering if I’ve ever cause anyone any harm. Only one moment comes to mind.

So here is some background. I attended boarding school for high school and on the night that my senior class graduated, there was a rather large and wild party in the dorms. I remember drunk students everywhere. Students were violently drunk and just partying like there was no tomorrow, I even grabbed a girl from falling over a railing of a flight of stairs. I, however, have never drank. Still to this day I am 25 years sober. So while this was all happening, I was attempting to pack my room, say goodbye to my friends, and collect my stuff from various other rooms before I departed in the morning.

Throughout my senior there was a couple who was pretty much glued to the hip, we’ll call them Ann and Bob. Now I was walking through the dorms when Bob walks out of Ann’s room. Bob greets me, visually tipsy but not out right drunk. He says good bye and I ask where Ann was. He told me she was in the room. I said something along the lines of “Well get back in there and serenade your woman! It’s your last night together! You two have some fun!” At 17, I thought that was rather innocent. He agreed and headed back into the room.

Now here is where it gets weird. The next morning when I go to say good bye to Ann, she ignores me. She deleted me from Facebook and would crop me out of photos. I couldn’t understand why until looking back; maybe she was extremely drunk and he assaulted her thinking it was consensual. Perhaps he did that because of my encouragement. Maybe she viewed me as the reason for her assault, if she was even assaulted at all. Perhaps she just never liked me and all of the Facebook crap was serendipitous.

However, 8 years later I don’t remember what either his or hers first or last name was. I got rid of my high school year book because I was heavily bullied and wanted no memory of it. I don’t have a Facebook or any other form of social media since 2012ish.  I don’t know how to reach out or even if I want to reach out. I haven’t had contact with anyone from my high school in 8 years. I’m terrified of finding out if caused her any harm. As a victim of sexual violence who still goes to weekly therapy to work through my trauma, the thought that I might be the source of another persons pain makes me feel like the scum of the earth. When I think of what might have happened, I feel like throwing up and sobbing. I wish I could profusely apologize to her, explain my side, and beg for her forgiveness. But I am also terrified of tracking her down to reach out. As well, maybe a sexual assault didn’t happen and this is all simply me projecting my experiences and misinterpreting what actually happened.

Anyway. To Ann, if that is actually your name or not, I deeply hope nothing happened to you and you genuinely just didn’t like me as a person. If something did happen, whether it was him trying to cop a feel or pressuring you into sex, please know that I’m so sorry. It was not my intent to cause that. I just thought you and bob were attached by the hip and nothing of malice would come from anything I said. I genuinely hope you are doing well, whether you hate me or not. 

I just had to get this off my chest. Thank you for reading.

19643,9lr1qg,post,"I used to objectify women in high school / treat them terribly, and I hate myself for it","I kind of looked back over the past year or so and thought about the way that I acted around women in high school, and I've felt ultra guilty for the things I said and did. The Kavanaugh hearings and the MeToo stuff really forced me to reflect on the way I acted, ya know?

I was ultra pushy. I'd go out on a few dates and after a week or so I'd try and sleep with the girl I was going out with. Or kiss them or touch them; I was big on verbal consent, sure, and I'd never send a dick pic (I thought I was above that and I thought that I was acting normal), but I'd text them weird things and be generally creepy towards women, asking what they were comfortable doing and shit like that. I moved way too fast and was way creepy. 

I never sexually assaulted anyone though. I had a rumor spread by an ex that I did (which was disproven, I sat through meetings with administration and she admitted on record that she bent the truth), and everybody believed it with my shitty, pushy reputation. What reason would they have not to, I really was a lecher.

I'm better now and I really regret acting the way I did; I never treated women like living, breathing things, I only treated them like walking sex dolls that I had a shot sleeping with. I was a gross neckbeardy asshole. I really try to not look at women that way anymore, and I feel guilty whenever I feel vaguely attracted to someone. I don't ever know where the line is, and I'm constantly anxious that I'm coming off as a creep. Instead I just seem like a nervous wreck, I think. I hate myself man. I really do.

I'm sorry guys this is a garbage stream of conciousness post, probably against the rules, I don't know. I'm drunk, on mobile, having an anxiety attack, makes my writing shitty.","I used to objectify women in high school / treat them terribly, and I hate myself for it I kind of looked back over the past year or so and thought about the way that I acted around women in high school, and I've felt ultra guilty for the things I said and did.

19644,9ldrej,post,I was recently diagnosed with PTSD...and I've kind of been taking advantage of it.,"  

In the beginning of the year I was diagnosed with PTSD as a result of separate instances of sexual assault, as well as just a terrible experience where a date wouldn’t leave my apartment and I had to lock myself in my bedroom until morning.

Mainly I just had a lot of trouble sleeping afterwards, and the trauma and sleep deprivation made a feedback loop making each one worse until I was also hallucinating and becoming delusional. I was luckily able to get into a treatment program, get therapy, medication, and joined a support group. I’m generally alright day to day (nights can be bad) and it hasn’t caused too much of an issue at work honestly. Maybe once every month or two I’ll have a day where I just cannot concentrate on my work or calm down and am constantly spacing out with flashbacks and heart rate crazy high. The constant running out due to crying spells is way embarrassing too since I work with all men.

After my first really bad day I asked my boss if I would be able to work in a private office room on my bad days or hours, but I didn’t disclose my diagnosis or anything. The pressure of acting normal and professional n an open office makes everything way worse. He said it was completely fine, but there have been a few times where I’m just tired, frustrated and need to get away, so I use the private room to remove myself from people and my responsibilities. I’m still doing work, just slower.

I also figured since I technically have a qualifying condition I might as well apply for a medical marijuana card. I know I don’t REALLY need it, but I already smoke recreationally and just hate having to rely on creepy strangers and go to their houses and stuff. I’d prefer to pay more for a normal business transaction.

Now I feel like this is probably the worst one, because it’s REALLY milking this thing where I don’t have to. I rely pretty much entirely on public transportation, and my mom recently let me know that PTSD is on the list of disabilities which are eligible for reduced fare (like 50%). So I applied, got approved, but feel like I’m taking from a system set up for people who really do need these things. 

I find all these things nice to have, a little more flexibility at work, reliable weed supply with professionals making sure I’m getting the right (and quality) product, and I’m saving a good deal of money on all my commuting. All these things have made life a little bit easier, but I know I’m not as bad as the people these programs and accommodations were made for. Even the word ‘disability’ rubs me wrong since I don’t feel like it really applies to me/my situation.

But, I’m not gonna stop. I’m trying to find the upsides to being raped over and over.","I was recently diagnosed with PTSD...and I've kind of been taking advantage of it.

19645,9ke2b1,post,I used to take unsolicited pictures of men I found attractive and I've felt horrible and guilty since.,"So basically at the tail end of high school, I started taking pictures of classmates whom I found attractive. I never put them online and they were never taken in bathrooms or locker rooms, nor did I ever snap pics of anything raunchy. I also did this when I was about 16 and 17. Eventually I was caught by a fellow student but nothing else happened and I graduated. I didn't receive any consequences. I of course stopped but, looking back, I feel the WHOLE process was traumatic for me, not just being caught. Even before being caught I felt disgusted by what I was doing, but for some reason I felt like I couldn't control it, like I just wanted to snap pics of guys I liked and that was that. I knew it wasn't physically hurtful but I felt like a creep anyways.

&#x200B;

For a while I moved on, like it bothered me but it was sort of a ""you were creepy in HS but you've grown up and you know that shit is creepy and the non-consensual nature of it isn't okay"". That was basically my mindset. But recently in the light of Brett Kavanaugh's history of sexual assault in high school, I can't help but feel disgusted that I'm on the spectrum of creeps. Yes, I never assaulted or raped anyone, but I did creepy shit without people's consent and it makes me feel horrible. Like I'm some sort of monster who's only a few stone throws away from Kavanaugh or Clarence Thomas. And I know the prevailing notion that stipulates that screwed up things in high school/teenage years are easier to forgive since we were younger, less able to understand consequences, and not able to control our desires, but I feel as if I was a horrible person anyways, like by that point I *should* have stopped myself and I *should* have known it was wrong. I did know it was wrong, but I just kept doing it.

&#x200B;

Anyways, I feel both remorse, but also fear. Fear that this behaviour will resurface and cause people to hate me, be disgusted by me, and think I'm some creep. I know deep down I'm not a sexual predator, rapist, or someone who wants to take advantage of people without their consent (I've been sexually assaulted and molested before so I know the feeling), but I feel people would judge me and see me as a creep for things I did when I was a teenager. I am thinking about going into a field of work where I could eventually be a known name to some degree, and I feel like if this shit got out, it would ruin me. I know that sounds selfish, and I know I've been using ""I"" a lot, but I can't really explain the remorse I have coupled with the fear that things I did years ago will come out now or later and make people think I'm the next Kevin Spacey or some creepy voyeur with an iPhone. What's worse is that people I know personally might think of me as an unredeemable creep and weirdo. 

&#x200B;

I know I'm not a horrible person, like the *real* me knows I'm not some creeper or pig, but another part of me basically says ""well, you took pictures of people without consent, so... you're a creeper till the day you die"" and I just want some clarity and opinions.

19647,9k2vb4,post,I was a stalker. I feel terrible. I should. (40s M),"Like a lot of people, Christine Blasey Ford's testimony has made me review my own life.  In my case, two different aspects of my life.  One, I was a victim of sexual assault (both by men and women).  But  more importantly, I was a stalker.

Let me explain.  In my junior and senior years in college, I fell obsessively in love with ""Ellen,"" a close female friend.  Despite her disavowals of interest, I kept essentially throwing myself at her feet, dreaming that just one more declaration of eternal love would finally persuade me to love me back.   (Ellen would often complaint about her difficulty in finding a boyfriend -- no, she was under no obligation to date me).  Sometimes I would step back.  At one point, Ellen actually set me up with the woman who became my first girlfriend (we had a relationship that lasted a few months).  But I would find myself drawn back into my obsession.  On some level, I understood that my behavior was bizarre --my sister mocked me incessantly for the way I would moon over Ellen during our frequent phone conversations.  She also persuaded me to destroy a three-page love letter I wrote to Ellen.  I periodically announced to Ellen's friends -- who were my friends, too -- that I had ""recognized reality.""  But soon, my obsession would consume me again.

The actions that bother the most in retrospect: during a vacation, I showed up unannounced at her home when she was alone.  I knocked on her door once late at night.  I never envisioned hurting her --  the only violent thoughts I ever had would have been aimed at myself, that I did not want to live anymore if Ellen did not love me -- but she must have been scared!!  At my graduation, Ellen's mother shot me a dirty look -- I felt ashamed.

After graduation, I realized that my behavior had been deeply disturbed.  I never behaved like that again.  I saw Ellen a couple of times again, always in the company of mutual friends and we had a good time hanging out (no avowals of eternal love).  I think I sent her a Christmas card or two.  But we didn't run in the same circles, and fell out of touch.  Years later, I learned that Ellen went to jail for some white-collar offenses, some involving the defrauding of mutual friends.   Not surprisingly, she has now vanished from any social scene with which I have contact.  I know what she is up to now, but I have decided that it is better for everybody that we never interact with each other for the remainder of our lives.

Now I am filled with guilt over my behavior, particularly the fact that I caused pain to someone I cared about a lot.  I don't want absolution from anyone.   My wife does not like me talking about my stalking of Ellen, because she thinks it sounds pathetic (true) and that I'm still hung up on Ellen (false).  Sometimes I think of reaching out to Ellen to apologize, but I don't think it would do anyone any good.  I really think I should never talk to Ellen again because it would only cause her pain (she doesn't attend college reunions, etc.).  I'm just not sure where to go with these feelings.  I find myself steaming with violent anger at men who victimize women, and I know some of this comes from my own guilt.  And maybe I should just own my guilt.","I was a stalker. I feel terrible. I should. (40s M) Like a lot of people, Christine Blasey Ford's testimony has made me review my own life.  In my case, two different aspects of my life.  One, I was a victim of sexual assault (both by men and women).  But  more importantly, I was a stalker.

Let me explain.  In my junior and senior years in college, I fell obsessively in love with ""Ellen,"" a close female friend.  Despite her disavowals of interest, I kept essentially throwing myself at her feet, dreaming that just one more declaration of eternal love would finally persuade me to love me back.   (Ellen would often complaint about her difficulty in finding a boyfriend -- no, she was under no obligation to date me).  Sometimes I would step back.  At one point, Ellen actually set me up with the woman who became my first girlfriend (we had a relationship that lasted a few months).  But I would find myself drawn back into my obsession.  On some level, I understood that my behavior was bizarre --my sister mocked me incessantly for the way I would moon over Ellen during our frequent phone conversations.  She also persuaded me to destroy a three-page love letter I wrote to Ellen.  I periodically announced to Ellen's friends -- who were my friends, too -- that I had ""recognized reality.""

19648,9jz2vf,post,I grabbed a man's genitals.,"In college, I had a long-time boyfriend and our relationship was rocky, at best. Things came to a head and I moved out. By ""moving out"", I mean that I was ""living with my friend and her current roommates until we got a house of our own."" At this time, I was drinking a lot. My heart was broken, I felt worthless, and I essentially gave up on thinking that anything I did even mattered. Obviously, this is dangerous but as an early 20's female, you couldn't tell me anything because I knew how the world worked. Or so I thought. 

My friend, let's call her R, was at work. Her other roommate, let's call him S, was at the house. Her other 3 roommates weren't around. S took me under his wing a bit and offered to hang out with me so I wasn't lonely. R told me before that S had a crush on me but I didn't believe it because guys just didn't like me. I wasn't good enough for guys to like me. It just didn't happen. After him making us drinks at the house, he decided that we should probably go to bed because things were late and I was really drunk. I didn't care. He took me to a spare bedroom and offered to sleep next to me and I agreed. I didn't think anything of it because he was always a nice guy. Super funny. Smart. Dorky. 

Here's the problem: I just assumed he wanted to have sex with me and being at a very low point in my life and self-esteem, I was willing to do it. I've never really been a timid woman, so we made out a little bit. I realized that my breath must have been awful from drinking and smoking, so I went to brush my teeth. I must have been super aggressive with it because my mouth hurt afterwards. I get back into the bed, still assuming that he wants to have sex and resigning myself to it because I had nothing to lose, and I grab his penis. He backs away from me and says that we can just cuddle. I didn't touch him again and I rolled over onto my left side. He spoons me. Nothing happened after that. 

All I can think about is that I am a sexual assaulter. I grabbed this guy's genitals without permission. Men can be assaulted too. I assaulted a man. I feel utterly disgusted with myself. I don't even know what to do.","I grabbed a man's genitals. In college, I had a long-time boyfriend and our relationship was rocky, at best. Things came to a head and I moved out.

19650,9j6fo0,post,I feel like I sexually assaulted my girlfriend years ago,"I won't go into too much detail, but towards the end of our relationship, she told me she had planned on having sex with me one weekend, but we had broken up. I decided to try to work things out with her and to also try and have sex with her.

When we would hook up, things would build up and I would move her underwear to the side (I had been thrusting into her but not actually going inside her). When I moved her underwear to the side, I would penetrate her some (usually no more than half of my dick) and thrust some. She never said anything one way or the other, but I had a little voice in my head saying that it was wrong for me to do. I told this voice that she's not objecting and that she's continuing to kiss me back and participate so I was fine.

Now I think about it a lot and am annoyed with myself for not asking to calm the voice in my head. She also asked, the last time we hooked up and had full on sex, if it meant she wasn't a virgin then. I constantly think about it and toil with whether it is sexual assault or not. On one hand, she didn't say anything and kept participating. On the other, I had a voice in my head telling me it might not be the smartest idea and that she might not know I moved her underwear and therefore it is sexual assault.","I feel like I sexually assaulted my girlfriend years ago I won't go into too much detail, but towards the end of our relationship, she told me she had planned on having sex with me one weekend, but we had broken up.

19651,9iyic9,post,"9 years ago, I groped a woman at a club. She turned out to be my cousin","I moved out of my hometown when I was four years old. I've only been back a handful of times, but most of my  extended family on my dad's side still live there. He has ten brothers and sisters, all of whom have multiple kids. I'm friends with a few cousins, but the rest I barely know.

When I was 21, I came back for my grandmother's birthday party. Afterward, I went clubbing with a bunch of cousins. It takes a lot of liquid courage to get me on the dance floor, so I got wasted.

At some point, I was grinding on a girl I didn't know. We ended up at a table, talking about school, work, hobbies, and so on. I had virtually no experience with women, but Drunk Me thought I had a shot. I made my move by pretending I couldn't hear her over the music, leaning in, and putting my hand around her waist. She didn't seem to mind, so after a little while, I pulled my hand back and put it on her thigh. She pushed it away and left the table. I didn't see her again until the very end of the night, when she inexplicably gave me a hug.

A few days later, I got a friend request on Facebook. I recognized her from the club immediately. Unfortunately, I also recognized her last name. Turns out, she was a cousin I hadn't seen in fifteen years.

This was almost a decade ago, but I get a renewed sense of shame every time I think about it. Whenever I start to feel good about myself, my brain reminds me of how creepy I can be. I shake my head at the stories of high-profile men accused of sexual assault, and then remember that I'm no better than they are.

I've never spoken about this to anyone. I had a chance to apologize to her three years ago, at another cousin's wedding, but I chickened out. Now, I feel like I can never go back to my hometown. I know I should apologize, but part of me just wants to pretend it never happened.","9 years ago, I groped a woman at a club.

19652,9ishm8,post,Sexually assaulted a classmate in high school,"All of the news recently has reminded me of something from my past.

When I was in high school, I got extremely drunk at a party and sexually assaulted a classmate. It has been 20 years but I remember it like it was yesterday. I groped her, said nasty things to her about what I wanted to do to her, and when she tried to get away, I held onto her and groped her some more. There were dozens of people watching it happen, laughing and egging me on, and no one, not one single person stepped in to help her. 

I have never denied that it happened, my wife and some friends know, but I have also never had to confront that it happened. She did not tell anyone, no one at the party ever said anything about it. I went back to school being the popular jock and she went back to being the quiet shy girl that she was. 

We are connected on social media but I have not spoken to her since high school. She seems okay – married with kids, a good job and life seems nice. 

I’ve always felt guilty about it but I have no idea what to do. I'm open to any advice on what to do/how to handle this.","Sexually assaulted a classmate in high school All of the news recently has reminded me of something from my past.

basically, a while back (neither of us can pin down the date), my boyfriend might have sexually assaulted me. 

to make a long story short i said i didn’t want to and he took that to mean ‘convince me’ and i kept saying no but it happened anyway. it hurt and i couldn’t have sex with him without crying for quite a while. 

we’ve talked it over for hours on end but we can’t decide whether it was actually the Dreaded ‘r-word’. he says he didn’t know i didn’t want to because he was ignoring me and that it was wrong, etc. etc. etc. i know what happened wasn’t right, and he seems to be coping and moving on, but i can’t. 

i’m still just so torn. we’ve decided that it doesn’t matter whether it was or wasn’t so long as we can stay together and move on, but i secretly feel like i was raped and what he did was horrible. there was no struggle and no fight and it doesn’t fall under the typical ‘i was drunk’ or ‘he held me down’ narrative you usually see, but i didn’t want to and it happened anyway. i just feel like it wasn’t bad enough, but i still have this sort of resentment against him that i can’t bring up because it’s been so long & i hated seeing him hurt over it. this isn’t the first time something of this nature happened, but this is the first time it went all the way so to speak.


tl;dr my boyfriend may have sexually assaulted me and not only do i feel like i was raped but i also simultaneously feel like i’m ‘faking it’ and claiming something i don’t have a right to. also, he doesn’t know i feel this way & thinks i’m over it just like he is.","i can’t help blaming my boyfriend even though it might not have been his fault. tw: rape/sexual assault i’ve never posted here before & i made a throwaway to do it, sorry if this is against any rules or anything like that.

19654,9fdlba,post,I sexually assaulted my little cousin when I was 10 and ive hated myself since then,"Sorry if this post isn't really formatted well, I'm new to this but I'll try. This happened almost 10 years ago and it's my biggest shame which eats me up inside.

So some backstory, I hadn't seen her for over 2 or so years (let's call her N and I as S). N and I had been pretty good friends as is so one time all our families met at our grandma's house for a get together so she was there along with the majority of my cousins. Everything was normal until for some reason I got horny, I had just hit puberty I think and recently been introduced to porn so I guess I was curious what really went on down there. I took a couple of my guy cousins and since I was the oldest they saw me as they're leader. We found N and took her to one of the guest bedrooms and undressed her and all of us were like ""woah that's what it looks like?"". I think we touched her chest and I touched her down there. I was kinda frozen for a second then I started joking with my cousins I was gonna ""put it inside"" and throughout all this she was like ""no please don't"" and she got scared and wanted to scream but one of my cousins put their hands on her mouth. I think she only got scared after I said I'd put it in because before she looked uncomfortable but she just went along with it not knowing how much of an animal I was being. After a moment of seeing her that scared I snapped out it and told them to get off her. Knowing I would get into trouble I told her not to say anything and she didn't.

Everything went back to normal and 2 years later I met her back at my grandma's house but this time I was more mature tho still dumb and apologized profusely for what I had done. She accepted my apology and said she had completely forgotten about it. I told the other cousins never to do that again and said sorry to them for having to see that. I haven't seen her since I apologized and I think I saw her on Facebook a while back but we haven't talked because I feel like a monster. What kind of twisted fuck attempts to molest their younger cousins?. I can never tell anyone else since they'll see me as a rapist and I don't want to bring it up with N in fear of opening up old wounds and there's even the possibility she still hates me for that. I also fear I might have damaged her emotionally cause I've heard and read things like this can really fuck with you and I'd be the sole reason as to why","I sexually assaulted my little cousin when I was 10 and ive hated myself since then Sorry if this post isn't really formatted well, I'm new to this but I'll try.

19655,9f9yf7,post,think i may have sexually assaulted someone and want to confess to what happened,"""K"" and I dated from October to April. During this relationship, we experimented sexually with each other. ""K"" was rather inexperienced, so a lot of what we did was ""trial and error"" - for lack of a better term. It first started with me trying to finger her and she expressed comfort with only over her underwear at that time. Over time, after doing only that for a while, I slowly motioned my hand under her underwear and moved my way towards her vagina and she allowed it. The same process happened with eating her out. My head would go down her legs and I'd kiss up them and she'd either move my head away (at first) or allow me to do it. Additionally, I did feel like I was moving too fast with things and told her I felt like we hooked up too much, to which she responded ""I am always down to do sexual things with you and will tell you if something isn't okay"". She truly lived this out by moving head or hands away or expressing no if she didn't want to hook up that night. She also expressed to me that she was ""afraid of sperm and that we would have sex before she ever gave me a handjob"". She also ruled blowjobs completely out for forever. Towards the end of our relationship, I started losing feelings for her and broke things off with her.

I broke up with her the week before my fraternity formal because part of me wanted to sleep with someone at it. When I got back to school from the formal, I met up with ""K"" because she wanted to talk. During this, she told me that ""she was going to have sex with me at formal"". So being the young, horny 19 year old that I was - I immediately started hooking up with her again because I thought she would have sex with me. I started trying to take things further with the intent of ALWAYS stopping if she expressed no or there was any level of discomfort/hesitation.

During these ensuing hookups, I would undress ""K"" down to her underwear and she would do the same to me. We would make out, I would finger her, occasionally eat her out, and then we would have ""outercourse"" where I would grind on top of her. I would then take my dick and angle it into her vagina over top of her underwear and start thrusting into her. It did hurt the tip of my dick a lot, but there was one time when the natural friction moved her underwear to the side and I immediately felt how wet it was. In combination with the friction and me grabbing my dick, I moved her underwear to the side so it stopped hurting my tip. I slowly started pumping into her some and felt a clear breakthrough, from where my dick was dry to when it was wet, into her (I think). I was scared that I was moving too fast or that she might end up saying no, so I only ended up going an inch or two inside of her. I ended up stopping because I was close to coming and didn't want to come in her. I did check to make sure she was enjoying herself and that she seemed okay with it.

In subsequent encounters, I would move her underwear and start to slowly pump into her like I did in the paragraph above, and gauged her reactions. While I knew it was unchartered waters, I told myself ""she's not saying anything objecting to it"" and she seemed into it in the moment. There was ONE time when she did ask me if I was over top of her underwear or not, and I got caught up in the moment and immediately used my hand to move her underwear back over top and pulled my tip out. I did say ""yes"" when it was back over, but more to confirm that it was - and I didn't go back to this during the encounter.

In encounters after this, I slowly built things up again and moved her underwear back to the side after gauging reactions and not doing it for some hookups. I moved it as to try and initiate things with her, but I always had the intention to stop if I was told or if I could tell she was uncomfortable and not enjoying herself. Eventually, we got to a point where she asked to have sex, but we stopped after she sat fully down on my dick because ""it hurt her too much"". We never ended up having sex though.

If I remember correctly, I only moved her underwear and handful of times, with the time she asked the question being the middle one. I always had the intention to stop and always checked to see if she was enjoying herself - which she was. I know I would've stopped if she had said anything or acted like she did during the one time I did stop, and I was just trying to warm things up to sex. I hate that I didn't ask and was just going off the fact that she wasn't saying anything - as I somewhat now feel like she wouldn't have said yes. (I'm not sure on that either though.) I now know that I will ALWAYS ask and not try to push things along, and will forever ask before initiating sex with any partner from here on out.","think i may have sexually assaulted someone and want to confess to what happened ""K"" and I dated from October to April. During this relationship, we experimented sexually with each other. ""K"" was rather inexperienced, so a lot of what we did was ""trial and error"" - for lack of a better term. It first started with me trying to finger her and she expressed comfort with only over her underwear at that time. Over time, after doing only that for a while, I slowly motioned my hand under her underwear and moved my way towards her vagina and she allowed it. The same process happened with eating her out. My head would go down her legs and I'd kiss up them and she'd either move my head away (at first) or allow me to do it. Additionally, I did feel like I was moving too fast with things and told her I felt like we hooked up too much, to which she responded ""I am always down to do sexual things with you and will tell you if something isn't okay"". She truly lived this out by moving head or hands away or expressing no if she didn't want to hook up that night. She also expressed to me that she was ""afraid of sperm and that we would have sex before she ever gave me a handjob"". She also ruled blowjobs completely out for forever. Towards the end of our relationship, I started losing feelings for her and broke things off with her.

19657,9d39qa,post,I told my girlfriend that I was sexually assaulted by someone while I was nearly black out wasted. In reality I could have pushed the person off of me at any time but didn't because it felt really good.,"This was 2 years ago. This was back when I was a party animal. I was on shrooms and xanax and quite a bit of alcohol, I was shirtless on a couch and barely even conscious. I remember I fell asleep, and when I woke up a girl was rubbing my chest and whispering something in my ear. I barely even remember exactly what happened that much, but I do remember some moments of clarity. There was nobody else in the room, the party was over, and she unbuckled my pants and eventually crawled on top of me and we had sex. It felt good at the time. And multiple times throughout, I could have just thrown her off, she was maybe 5'2 and I am 6'3 and muscular. But I didn't, I let her do that. I honestly think the reason why was that we didn't use a condom, and I had been using condoms exclusively with my GF for a year, and so having sex without one felt *so good*. Of course, the drugs and alcohol also dulled my sense of judgement. I didn't really do anything except lay there, close my eyes, and let her do her thing. 

I came and she continued riding, but I guess me making noises awoke someone. They came into the room, and saw what was going on, and the girl quickly got off of me and got her clothes together and left. The person who came in before then returned, and I felt a wave of nausea come over me from the xanax and alcohol, and I was completely incoherent and blabbering and falling over. Two more people awoke and came in and the person told them that I had clearly been sexually assaulted because I couldn't consent in this position. They weren't wrong. It was sexual assault. 

We contacted the police and everything, and my girlfriend was notified. I didn't want to contact the police, but regardless, we did, and to be fair she was intensely creepy for doing that, she knew damn well I couldn't consent. Sure, I may have been a big guy who enjoyed it, but its possible she is doing that kind of stuff to other guys who don't enjoy it. 

Except, I wasn't like traumatized. At all. In fact I enjoyed it. I never consented or anything, but I still enjoyed it. I had to act like it was a terrible experience to my girlfriend so that she wouldn't feel upset that I had sex with someone else. The reality was that even though she technically did sexually assault me, I could have thrown her off at any time, and I didn't because it felt amazing. 

I feel kind of shitty about this. It does feel like cheating, mostly because honestly? It was cheating. I know damn well the thought of ""let me just throw her off me"" went through my head about a dozen times, but I never did. I was incoherent and wasted but not completely useless. 

We are still together. Girl was never caught (this was a big, big party, nobody knew who invited her, and only me and one other actually saw her). Me and my girlfriend are on the verge of getting engaged soon. 

Yes, I got STD checked. 3 times.

19658,98wtsu,post,"I got a handjob from a masseuse. I've got a fiancé and if I tell her, I'm sure she would break up with me.","Pretty much the title.  This happened 5 hours ago, I went for a massage at a (admittedly above-board) looking place.  The masseuse told me to get naked and she would be back in five minutes.  While she was massaging my upper thigh, I got a boner.  She noticed this, removed the towel and went to business like it was just part of the procedure.  I didn't stop her.

Upon checking the massage parlors website when I got home, they clearly indicate that ""sensual massages"" are available upon request.  I guess seeing as I am a slightly overweight and balding 34 year old man, she assumed I was there for that.

My fiancé gets home from work in a few hours.  I really need to tell her.  I wish I could go back 8 hours and not get into my car to drive to this place. So much fucking regret.

**Update:**

I told her.

I feel like shit about it, and if it happened to her, I would want to know.  We are going to be spending the rest of our lives together and I don't want shit like this in my closet, and if this happens to her, I want her to be able to tell me.  Anyways, the conversation was quite short and went something like this:

Claire's first question was ""was she pretty?""  I answered truthfully, which she was an average middle-aged women who smelled like cigarettes and stale coffee.

The follow up was ""well then why didn't you stop her?""  Because I honestly froze for a minute, and just went with it.

She didn't really like this answer.  She then asked ""are you not happy with me?""  I told her that she is absolutely perfect, but this had nothing to do with being happy in the relationship.  I was in a position where I had to do something and I didn't, which is my fuck up and failure as a partner.

She then said that she is not going to break up with me ""just yet"" but will sleep on it and see in the morning.  She seemed pretty hurt, she was fighting back tears.  I offered to sleep in the guest bedroom and she said that I didn't have to be that dramatic.  Maybe a good sign?

A few people have bought up sexual assault.  I don't feel like a victim, I feel like a perpetrator.

(**Probably) Final Update:**

I think we are good, all things considered.  I'm probably not going to update this post again unless something drastically changes.

We had a brief chat this morning before she went to work (I work from home) and she told me we need to talk tonight.

I said ""uh-oh, that doesn't sound great"" and she ""it's not like that, I just needs to understand why you didn't stop her"". I asked her what would happen if we reversed roles, and she said she would stop the dude. I said I would say the same thing, but in practice I just froze up and couldn't. She was surprisingly empathetic towards this.

She also said she doesn't feel like she can trust me right now (understandable), but she doesn't feel like I cheated on her per se, rather I just did something incredibly stupid.

She actually said she almost wishes that I didn't tell her, we agreed that our marriage needs to be a 100% open and honest relationship, we are a team and need to deal with shit together. We've both had relationships in the past where this was not the case, and landed up getting hurt as a result.

All that was about 6 hours ago, at about 9:00am this morning.

She texted me about an hour ago saying she still loves me, and the more she thinks about it the more she sees it as a mistake, not a character flaw, and that if I find myself in a position where this can happen again, I need to stop it.

I wrote an email (with an old anonymous email address I have) to the place describing what happened. I didn't mention the masseuse's name - but what happened and that the ladies there should be asking for consent. I got an almost immediate reply apologizing and assuring me that they are not a brothel etc. More like CYA stuff than acknowledging the problem. But at least I did something.

\---

Thanks everyone for taking the time to read my story and comment.  Honestly, I got a lot more support and attention than I thought that I would, and it helped a lot.  Even those calling me out for being a bitch, I probably needed to hear that as well.  A simple ""no"" would have turned this whole thing into a  mildly humorous anecdote.

\--

**TLDR:** Massage Therapist gave me a handie without asking.  I went along with it, despite feeling uncomfortable.  Told my fiancé, she didn't break up with me as I thought she would, but will probably take a couple weeks for things to get back to normal.","I got a handjob from a masseuse.

19659,98dnie,post,I feel like a mistake and nothing makes me feel better.,"I’m 30 years old and married with kids who I really really love and I feel blessed to have them. Personally though I honestly feel like my whole existence is just kinda not meant to be. I never knew my father growing up and had a bunch of step dads that would spend more time with my brother which resulted in me being a momma’s boy which is fine with me. When I was roughly 15 years old one of my great aunts joked about me being a birth control baby, which ended up with my mom confessing that yea I wasn’t planned and a “unexpected blessing.”

Fast forward a year where I meet my biological father (who bailed when I was a baby) who belittled me constantly for being black (he was white guy who wanted to be black so badly) and enjoying metal and goth stuff. He even told me he thinks I’m not his which isn’t something I wanted to hear.  A good 13 years later of him and I going back and forth and not getting along we both just randomly do a Ancestry.com and sure enough he’s not my biological father. I’m happy to not have to deal with him anymore but there is now that emptiness that’s back. 

I find my 1/2 sister! And we text and chat and get along pretty well but then I find out that our dad (who was married to my sisters mom) was a massive cheater and had tons of kids outside of the marriage and doesn’t care about any of his kids.  My mother swears she never cheated and thinks she was sexually assaulted at a party because she doesn’t remember sleeping with anyone else. YES my mom could be lying and I have that thought but I can kinda tell she believes what she is saying. 

So to sum it up I was a accident child whose father is a dead beat and possibly doesn’t know I existed and also possibly raped or took advantage of my mother. It’s really messing with me as a person but it’s not effecting my family life but it’s keeping me up at night.

19660,975h3b,post,I sexually assaulted my friends growing up,"With the rise of the #metoo movement and possibly as a result of maturing in general, I have realized that I committed sexual assault on quite a few friends growing up and I feel really guilty about it. I'm a gay male but I didn't accept it until I was 17 or come out until college. I had always considered these things ""experimenting"" although they were almost always one sided. 

As a teenager I would often hang out at friends houses and spend the night. These friends were very masculine small town football player types, like myself, and we were all ignorantly homophobic and assholes to the gay or more feminine kids. Until we were about 16 we generally slept in the same bed. I would be very horny and would sometimes find myself gravitating closer and closer to them in my sleep. Some of it honestly was some sort of sleep thing where I would kind of grind on them while honestly sleeping until I woke up and sort of realized it. Usually I would get really embarrassed and hope they didnt notice it and turn over and pray they didnt notice it. Other times.....

I would keep doing it and take things even further. Sometimes touching their dicks and stuff through their shorts or even try to sneak my hand into their shorts. The first time I did this to a friend, ""Tom"", he woke up and when I tried to move away  he told me to keep going which resulted in some true experimentation that actually continued for years. The other few friends I did these things to didnt go the same way. Generally they didnt do anything and kept sleeping until I jerked myself off, just stopped, or their breathing changed/they moved around and I freaked out thinking I'd been caught. One time one of my friends pushed my hand off him and was like ""dude wtf"" and I pretended he woke me up. He understandably asked me to sleep on the floor after that and gave me a hard time about it but our friendship didn't change really. Then at some point my friends ended up talking to each other about it and realized they all had similar experiences, even the friends who I didn't think had ever noticed. Then they had a sort of ""intervention"" with me and made fun of me for it. They thought I would sleep and dream that I was with a girl and start touching them in my sleep. So after that I slept on the floor but we were all getting older so it wasnt normal for us to be sleeping in the same bed any way. This pretty much solved the issue. Honestly I think I was trying to recreate the ""Tom"" scenario with friends I found more attractive then him, especially after he moved away. I stayed friends with all those guys and am still close to a couple to this day. 

When I turned 17, I accepted that I was gay and that this wasnt normal experimentation although I didnt really consider the things I had done in the prior years wrong yet. But I loved my friends and I vowed to never come out and to marry a woman and never try to do gay things again, especially to my friends. When I was 19 I went to this party with some new college friends and this is the one that I regret the most. I got too drunk to drive and my closest-newish friend offered to let me stay at his place. We drank more at his house and I blacked out. I remember coming to my senses when he punched me in the face and said ""get on the fucking floor and never touch me again"". I was still really drunk and at some point tried to move back to his bed and touch him just like I used to do to my friends. He woke up and kicked me in face knocking me back on the floor. I stayed there and fell asleep. I woke up and realized I was butt naked and I could not find my pants, I stole a pair of his basketball shorts. Im still not completely sure of everything I did or tried to do that night. He was downstairs and I tried to act like I didnt remember anything from the night before and pulled the whole ""wow what a crazy night"" thing. He was kind of awkward towards me but not mean and he said he had stuff to do giving me a hint to leave. So I left in his shorts. We never talked again. Ever. Pretty much everyone in that new friend group stopped talking to me too. I felt/feel awful about the whole situation. 

I came out of the closet 3 months later and accepted myself and have never tried to pull anything like that again drunk or sober. Its been over 3 years now but I still feel terrible about it and for destroying our developing close friendship. I also feel guilty towards my friends that I touched in their sleep before that, especially towards the couple that were very accepting when I came out and that I'm still good friends with. They've made occasional jokes but have never seriously brought it up and I wonder if they ever think about it and how I basically took advantage of them. I'm so lucky I didnt face legal action for the drunken night and that I didn't hurt my friendships with the other guys. I always feel slightly guilty when sexual assault gets brought up in conversation or when I see it on TV. I'm also worried that if I ever become successful these things might surface and drag me down like they have to others. 

","I sexually assaulted my friends growing up With the rise of the #metoo movement and possibly as a result of maturing in general, I have realized that I committed sexual assault on quite a few friends growing up and I feel really guilty about it. I'm a gay male but I didn't accept it until I was 17 or come out until college. I had always considered these things ""experimenting"" although they were almost always one sided. 

As a teenager I would often hang out at friends houses and spend the night. These friends were very masculine small town football player types, like myself, and we were all ignorantly homophobic and assholes to the gay or more feminine kids. Until we were about 16 we generally slept in the same bed. I would be very horny and would sometimes find myself gravitating closer and closer to them in my sleep. Some of it honestly was some sort of sleep thing where I would kind of grind on them while honestly sleeping until I woke up and sort of realized it. Usually I would get really embarrassed and hope they didnt notice it and turn over and pray they didnt notice it. Other times.....

I would keep doing it and take things even further. Sometimes touching their dicks and stuff through their shorts or even try to sneak my hand into their shorts. The first time I did this to a friend, ""Tom"", he woke up and when I tried to move away  he told me to keep going which resulted in some true experimentation that actually continued for years. The other few friends I did these things to didnt go the same way. Generally they didnt do anything and kept sleeping until I jerked myself off, just stopped, or their breathing changed/they moved around and I freaked out thinking I'd been caught. One time one of my friends pushed my hand off him and was like ""dude wtf"" and I pretended he woke me up. He understandably asked me to sleep on the floor after that and gave me a hard time about it but our friendship didn't change really. Then at some point my friends ended up talking to each other about it and realized they all had similar experiences, even the friends who I didn't think had ever noticed. Then they had a sort of ""intervention"" with me and made fun of me for it. They thought I would sleep and dream that I was with a girl and start touching them in my sleep.

19663,90xyi9,post,[Tough Love] I was depressed for six months,"[Remorse]

For about a year and a half to two years, I was bullied by someone who had many mutural friends and was friendly to everyone else, hence made me feel like I couldn't tell anyone that he was bullying me because they wouldn't believe me. After coming back to University after the summer holiday, I left the society that I was in so I didn't have to see him. No one really cared that I left, and I realised that I didn't have any real friends, I was never invited to anything outside of the society despite seeing it on social media all the time. I was also kind of bullied at secondary School so meeting new people was really hard for me and my house was empty most of the time as one of my housemates was doing a semester abroad. So I was going to lectures then going home and being by my self.

I was getting more and more depressed over the next year months and then one night I got black out drunk and tried to get with a friend who didn't not want me to get with her, makes me sick to say it but it was sexual assault. After that I skipped lectures, had an awful sleeping pattern, hated my self and would think of possible ways to kill my self. A month after that incident, in December, I was at an event where my bully was, I was ordering a drink and he came up to me and asked if I was okay, as I told his girlfriend's brother that I wanted to speak to him (I knew him for years) but never ended up talking to him. 

I bluntly told him all the shit he had done to me and he told me to fuck off, I just walked anyway crying. A while later he found me and I told him again, he said he was sorry, he asked if I thought he had bullied me but I said ""no"", I wish I said yes. I still didn't want to make him feel bad.

From December to about April/may I would regularly cry when I came home from University, just being in the city made me depressed. Small slip ups, like dropping food, would make me cry. A few friends made comments that I wasnt the same, but didn't push it out of me, I've never opened up to anyone. There was one moment when I was in a computer-lab session just staring at my screen because I was thinking about killing my self and then my lecturer kicked my chair because he thought I was day dreaming and I nearly cried infront of everyone. At the Easter holiday I weighed my self and I had gained about 8-9kg over a few months. I decided to start running and found it thereputic. There was something about it and I think it definitely contributed to my cure from depression. 

From April to today I slowly had fewer and fewer days where I would feel depressed and I think I'm okay, however I still do feel that any massive fuck-up will put me into a depression again","[Tough Love] I was depressed for six months [Remorse]

19664,90245h,post,[Remorseful] I sexually assaulted my ex and he has forgiven me but I haven’t forgiven me,"So, I dated a guy for about 14 months ish in college. During that time period was probably the darkest days of my life. Not making excuses but it’s improtant to explain the shift in my mind set.  I have bipolar depression (manic depression) and was seeing a quack. Because of this I went off my meds (actually turns out I was semi justified. The pill cocktail he had me on actually exasperates bipolar depression. My current doc who I love even reported him to the medical board). But instead of just being off my meds I was on drugs. Most things pot but with some uppers thrown in and some pain pills. Self harmed a lot, and still have some physical scars from those days. Also dealing with the death of my aunt and the failing health of the woman who raised me (grandma passed away a little after we broke up). So yeah, pretty shitty time. 

N, my ex, never did much drugs of any kind outside of pot. And he tried to be as supportive as possible which was impressive because I never made it easy on him.  Anyway, there were a few nights (notice the plural) where I got a lot more handsy than he wanted. I would just casually ignore his “no”’s. Sometimes aggressively. At least once he punched me to stop me that I remember (the whole time period in my life is fuzzy). 


I feel terrible about it. I knew it was wrong but since I got my mind out of that drug/depression induced haze I was mortified by what I have done. I sexually assaulted one of the few people who tried to help me. Multiple times. Idk what the fuck  is the matter with me. Is my soul really that fucking dark? I wouldn’t ever do something like that now but then I wonder if that was the real me not restrained by society or if present me is the real me (or is present me just the by product of meds meant to tamper me down?)?  

About six months after we broke up I tried to kill myself.  About 8 shots of tequila and a fairly large amount of sleeping pills.  Slept on my side and vomited it all out.  

I’ve sincerely apologized to N. He has accepted it and seems to generally still want to be my friend. We play chess online quite often averaging maybe a game a week and I’m going to see him for the first time in two years on a trip next month. He’s even letting me to stay with him and his gf (he is bi) for a couple nights. He seems happy and is living a normal life so I hope whatever I did, didn’t affect him too much. But I still don’t know how he talks to me. I occasionally break off communication because I feel so ashamed. 


And now since I’m going to see him in person again I just am so worried that it’ll send me into a depressive state. Even if he’s forgiven me I have not forgiven me. I’m still trying to reconcile who I think I am with my actions and I don’t know what the fuck to think. Idk if I’m an animal or a sick person or something between or what.  It’s some weird existential crisis similar to Lord Jim if you have read the novel. And regardless of how N seems I’m afraid I caused lasting problems for him. 

And now I’m worried that I can’t have a relationship because of this, I’ve kind of stopped dating/sabotaged any dates I had because I don’t think I deserve it and just don’t know if I can be in a relationship and be healthy for them.  I don’t fucking know. I needed to tell someone.

19667,8zf3e5,post,"I feel like less of a woman because I haven't had to go through any stereotypically ""woman"" problems in my life","I know it sounds dumb, but I feel like I'm cheating my way though life as a woman because of my lack of problems that I've encountered and it seems like every other woman has had lots of these problems. I know there are plenty of other girls out there who are like me but it still feels like I'm doing the whole ""being a woman"" thing wrong, which is dumb because there is no wrong way to be a woman. 

I have never been raped, sexually assaulted, cat called, followed, creeped on, objectified, etc. I have never been looked down upon as less capable because I'm a girl. I've never been given the impression that STEM or sports or anything else stereotypical ""male"" was not for a girl. In fact my dad wanted me to be an engineer or computer scientist since it runs in the family and my mom wanted me to be a sports commentator since I love football so much. I have never been mansplained to. I have had doctors not take pain I was feeling seriously (and yes I've had plenty of pain before. I'm a medical mystery child). I've never been treated differently than my brothers. I've never had my looks or weight brought up in contexts that weren't appropriate (I am skinny and have been told I'm cute). I don't even have stereotypical girl boob issues because I have tiny tits. I just haven't had very many negative issues relating to be being a girl (except for some very normal period issues). I don't think I missed any major issue that I've been hearing about lately but feel free to ask about one I'm missing. 

Don't get me wrong, **I am extremely grateful that I've never had any of these issues or experiences and I hope there comes a time where no girl has these issues**, but in some weird way I feel like less of a woman because of it. A lot of these issues are frequently talked about now as common issues for women and I can't relate so it makes me feel like I'm not a part of it. Idk. I still feel like they're important issues that need to be brought up and still fully give my support to other women in these issues but I feel like an outsider and a fraud. I feel like I haven't earned my ""woman card"" because I haven't gone through any ""woman issues"" (and yes I know these things can happen to men). 

A little context on me: I am a 22 year old, attractive girl from the Midwest US. I am currently in college at a large and very good public university. I come from a wealthy but not rich family from a wealthy town. I interact with plenty of people and go out to the bars and other events to socialize so it's not like I never experience these things because I don't leave my house. 
","I feel like less of a woman because I haven't had to go through any stereotypically ""woman"" problems in my life I know it sounds dumb, but I feel like I'm cheating my way though life as a woman because of my lack of problems that I've encountered and it seems like every other woman has had lots of these problems. I know there are plenty of other girls out there who are like me but it still feels like I'm doing the whole ""being a woman"" thing wrong, which is dumb because there is no wrong way to be a woman. 

I have never been raped, sexually assaulted, cat called, followed, creeped on, objectified, etc. I have never been looked down upon as less capable because I'm a girl. I've never been given the impression that STEM or sports or anything else stereotypical ""male"" was not for a girl. In fact my dad wanted me to be an engineer or computer scientist since it runs in the family and my mom wanted me to be a sports commentator since I love football so much. I have never been mansplained to. I have had doctors not take pain I was feeling seriously (and yes I've had plenty of pain before. I'm a medical mystery child). I've never been treated differently than my brothers. I've never had my looks or weight brought up in contexts that weren't appropriate (I am skinny and have been told I'm cute).

19670,1i4dw0l,post,"Teachers forced me to pull up my skirt to prove to them I had shorts on, I was 13.","Mention of: child on child sa and sa

This was March 2022 and I was into the whole “alternative” look. So, I would wear skirts that were a little too short for school, and I can admit that.

I was in my math class, just messing around with my friends. I was then called out of the class room by the 8th grade science teacher and her assistant, at that time I had no idea who they were and what their names were.

Right as I walked into the hallway, I was imitating told to lift up my skirt. Like one would do, I told them no and that there’s other students in the hallway and i’m uncomfortable. After us going back and forth for less than a minute, I lifted up my skirt to just get it over with.

I went back into class, trying not to cry from feeling embarrassed and dirty. My friends were asking me what was wrong, I wrote what happened on a paper, they took turns passing it to each other, and then my (male) math teacher came up to me and yelled at me for saying what happened and “They don’t need to know what happened”. 

I was already dealing with being sexually assaulted by a kid in my class for 3 months and then continued for another 3 months after that, but that’s a different story. So with the anxiety I had going to school because of that, made everything so much worse.

I later called my dad to pick me up from school. My mom, who obviously would be upset, called the principal. All my mom got as a response is to switch schools that are 30min-1hr away from where we live and that they won’t do anything about what just happened.

I’m now 16 and a sophomore in high school. The science teacher and assistant retired, along with my principal getting fired that next year. Last year the kid was reported for sa from many other students and they let him switch schools so no legal issues happened.","Teachers forced me to pull up my skirt to prove to them I had shorts on, I was 13.

19671,1i1njlo,post,I had a breakthrough in Therapy today & no one to share it with...,"TW: CSA & DV/SA mentioned. 

I'm mostly on Reddit as a lurker so have never posted & don't really know how to, so please bare with me. Not sure if this is right sub but I just gotta share this SOMEWHERE

I've (32F) been in Therapy on/off over the last 15+ years to get support for CSA as well as DV abuse that occurred from late teens to mid 20s. If I'm being honest, I'd never completely engaged or committed to these sessions as I'd felt I was fine & didn't need to revisit the past. 

4 yrs ago though I met my fiance (37m) whose honestly just so amazing. I decided after meeting him that I would work hard to be my best self - no more leaning on CSA or DV as an excuse for toxic behaviours or habits I hadn't unlearned yet, no more being a doormat or being so strong that there's no room for compromise; essentially just no more 'hurt people, hurt people' behaviour. We also decided that we wanted to try start a family (both have fertility issues).

Because of all this, I decided to get back into therapy & truly commit to ensure I could be the partner my fiance deserves, the person I deserve & dream of being, and to be a better mother to my future child than my own was/tried to be. 

I've been in Therapy for almost a year now & it's been amazing. I've learned to communicate so much more clearly and coherently, I no longer shrink from confrontation or if there's a difference in opinion. I've learnt to communicate & stay firm about what I need, want etc. Overall, I now have more self confidence, understanding of my trauma & physical/mental reactions, and my relationship is thriving.

Yesterday during my therapy session we were 'processing' a pretty tough memory of CSA, and the thought or cognition we're trying to dispel is ""I am tainted"".

While we were processing this, I had a revelation: our skin cells completely regenerate every 7-10 years, and daily we lose close to 500 million skin cells everyday. I realised that the skin (and skin cells) that was violated (or tainted) is gone.

Poof. Just like that - they're gone. 

And so too is the thought that I'm tainted. 

The body my fiance has touched is not the same one that was violated repeatedly over the years. 

The body that my fiance has touched has not been mistreated or abused 

The body that my fiance has touched is completely different, it's not tainted. It's not me. 

The body that my fiance has touched is loving, caring, kind, empathetic. It no longer shakes or seeks shelter when a man raises his hand or voice.

This body won't bow or bend to manipulatation, abuse, or mistreatment. 
This body is fill of love, light & happiness. 

This body is NOT tainted, and nothing for me to feel ashamed about, or trapped in. 

This body is my own. I have control over it. I say who can/can't touch me. I say who I'll allow in my presence. I am in control & only I can sail this ship. 

And aside from my fiance, I have no one else to share these profound feelings of relief and achievement. 

So I hope someone on Reddit can quietly celebrate this milestone with me. I'm not tainted, I'm not worthless. I am me. And I am now Free.

19675,1hy0dnl,post,"I did something horrible when I was a kid, and I deeply regret it","I (25f) did something horrible when I was younger. I think I was around 9-10 at the time, and my brother was 5-6. I won’t go into details, since it makes me feel physically sick but I just need to get this out and I’ve never told anyone. 

I SA’d my brother (no penetration or anything like that, it was just genital to genital contact) and I feel so so fking disgusting. 

I know people here say that for child on child SA it’s maybe because the other child was SA’d themselves, though I’m not sure if I ever was…though I do remember an inappropriate moment with my moms boss, probably around that time if not a bit younger. I’m not trying to excuse what I did whatsoever, I promise you that. 

I don’t think I could ever talk about this in person, and I’m sure my brother doesn’t even remember since it was so long ago. I can’t even describe how much of a terrible person I feel I am. 

I’m not looking for anything here, I just wanted to get this off my chest since I’ve been carrying it for so long. 

Edit: thank you to everyone who has responded already, I appreciate it and I’ll try and respond to everyone in the morning. For those saying that my brother remembers, I know that is likely very very accurate 😭 I think I hold onto the idea that he doesn’t remember because it at least helps me to not hate myself as much 😭😭 but deep down, I know that he probably does remember:(

Edit 2: I’m sorry for saying that I doubt he doesn’t remember, I don’t mean to dismiss anything he may be feeling. I also want to say (if it isn’t clear enough) that I do know that what I did wasn’t okay, and it’s not ever okay (regardless of age or gender or anything like that) and I’m not trying to dismiss male victims of SA in any way 😭 I knew immediately after that what I didn’t wasn’t okay, as I felt disgusting and nothing ever happened again after that

Edit 3: thank you again to everyone who responded. I think it might be a bit difficult to respond to everyone’s comments so I’ll try and respond to the ones I feel like I can respond to (and I’ll try and respond the best I can to most of them) but thank you guys again ","I did something horrible when I was a kid, and I deeply regret it I (25f) did something horrible when I was younger.

I also want to say (if it isn’t clear enough) that I do know that what I did wasn’t okay, and it’s not ever okay (regardless of age or gender or anything like that) and I’m not trying to dismiss male victims of SA in any way 😭 I knew immediately after that what I didn’t wasn’t okay, as I felt disgusting and nothing ever happened again after that

Edit 3: thank you again to everyone who responded. I think it might be a bit difficult to respond to everyone’s comments so I’ll try and respond to the ones I feel like I can respond to (and I’ll try and respond the best I can to most of them) but thank you guys again ",1424,130.0,2025-01-10 9:02,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1hy0dnl/i_did_something_horrible_when_i_was_a_kid_and_i/,Neutral

19680,1httne6,post,I haven't told my parents about a traumatizing experience i had as a child. ,"(Trigger warning: sh, sa, stalking, threats)

I (17 f) still haven't discussed this experience with my parents. Let me give a background story. Just letting you know, due to it being a traumatic experience, it's difficult to remember every small detail of the story.
Back in 6th grade, when I was around 11 years old, I was stuck in a small friend group. It consisted of a few other girls. Back then, I knew absolutely nothing about sex, intimacy, or ""the talk."" My friends got into the conversation about boyfriends and being intimate with a future boyfriend. They all were very adamant about getting a boyfriend and peer pressured me into wanting one. (Time skip a few weeks) My friend group found a random boy in my grade and set him up with me without my knowledge. 
During recess, he would try to talk to me and get close to me. I showed no interest in him or any boy, and I think that set him off. He would get more aggressive and demand that I become his girlfriend. Eventually, he got very pissed off because I had been ignoring him for a week. 
He told me that if I didn't become his girlfriend, he would m*rder my entire family. (I know this is stupid, but I was young and gullible) I said yes... over the course of 3 months, he was very close and always next to me. He was consistently touchy and wouldn't leave me alone when I politely asked him to. After school (we both walked home since we lived in town), he would walk with me. Only a couple weeks into our ""relationship,"" he would drag me into a gap between two buildings. He said he wanted to kiss me and pushed me into a wall. Obviously, I said no, but he didn't listen. He kissed me for a while, then let go and walked himself home. I threw up and became dizzy after this, but I eventually went home. He did this every school day for a month straight. He would tell me that he wanted to do more with me, and I constantly refused. Throughout this entire experience, he became more and more aggressive to the point where he would drag me into the building gap. He shoved me into the wall so hard it left bruises and would lean his entire body weight into me. He would also make attempts to inappropriately touch me. Eventually, I had enough and told him I wanted to ""break up""
He freaked out and said he would m*rder me and my family. He also told me that he will have sex with my dead body and then k*ll himself so we will be reunited into the afterlife. I ignored him even though I was terrified. He then proceeded to stalk me for three years and watch me outside my house. I lived in fear and developed unhealthy and dangerous coping mechanisms. I started self harming, and that progressively got worse. I also developed an eating disorder, and I'm still living with severe anxiety and depression. 
When I was in 8th grade, I walked outside my house to take out the trash, and he was there waiting for me. He came up behind me and dragged me into my garage. He then tried to SA me, but I got away. I talked to the guidance counselor at my school, saying he was threatening me, so she told him to leave me alone. He stalked me until 9th grade.
To this day, I am still dealing with the fear and trauma of that experience. I haven't told my parents because, as a child, they were very neglectful to me and often focused on my three other siblings. I also got all of the punishments as a kid, even when I didn't do it. I never got my own space, and It was blatantly obvious that I was the least favorite. So I have never trusted them enough to tell them. 
I was also never able to get rid of the coping mechanisms. The sh turned into an addiction and would get worse and worse each time. I turned suicidal and my depression got worse. 
Being severely traumatized from this, it also affected my first real relationship with a boy. I consistently flinch anytime I'm tapped or touched. I don't like people near or around me. So we never did anything intimate together. My boyfriend got upset with this even though I told him my trauma. (Later into the relationship, he completely forgot the entire story of my trauma)
We also broke up, which surprisingly made me feel much better. Now, I don't want relationships, intimacy, or any human contact whatsoever. 
The boy that did all of that to me is still in my class, and I have to see him every day, which does not help me cope. 
Should I have told more people? What are your thoughts on this? 

Edit: I also mentioned my depression and anxiety to my parents, and they scheduled a therapy appointment. The appointment was with a guy. My parents have shown no interest in scheduling another appt for me and also haven't looked into female therapists.","I haven't told my parents about a traumatizing experience i had as a child.

19681,1hs8c3n,post,"In middle school I told on some friends related to the ""goon squad incident"". . .","INTRODUCTION:

So me M11 at the time (now M14) had a problematic, to say the least, friend group, there was Jack (fake name +1 yoa), David (\~same yoa), John (\~same yoa), Jayden (+1 yoa). So Jayden was pretty tame, but like me he got caught with the 'bad' kids. Our school worked by placing kids in a 2-3 year range in the same class. Our school was small, like really, really, small. Private about 100 kids. So as a byproduct of those small kid amounts in my 4-5th grade class (i was M9-10 at the time) left the 'bad' kids to all be together with only about 3 'good boys' I wont deny that our female teacher was most-likely subconsciously sexist as we would have to endure much higher punishment that the girls would. These kids could no stop taking (me being the same, I still impulsively talk) but what separated them from Jayden and I was general maturity. David, Jack, and John where very immature and Jack (still my friend out of school) got diagnosed with ADD/ADHD during middle school. 

SECTION 1:

The thing that really flipped the switch for me in my mind is a memory so bittersweet that it will never leave my mind.  One day we were playing on the field with a jump-rope and we were spinning it around while others jumped in a circle and when this >!bitchass!<Jack got out of the game he came over to me and grabbed my >!nuts!<, I was angry so I told Jack to 'stop', he did it again, I told him 'STOP', then he did it again, me feeling hurt (literally and figuratively.) So I ran over to the corner of the field and started crying. Everyone who was playing ran over to me and came by my side which made me want to cry even more, but as the messiah is to Christians Jayden came over and handed me the folded up rope and told me ""GO"", so I went over to Jack and I >!fucking!<slammed that idiot, the teachers told me, it's fine but we will have to write it up as an injury report because he had a giant bruise on his upper arm. After that people came up to me to ask what happened and I told them everything, I felt on top of the world.

SECTION 2:

When we all got to middle school I said >!fuck that,!<and I left them, thinking they were horrible people because they would verbally and physically harass me so I got a new friend group with some people that I'm on good terms with to this day. Although this sounds fine and dandy, I'm like 99% sure the teachers thought they were annoying and that they (probably) hated me. Our school works in cycles which there are 4, 2 month, 2 month, 3 month, 2 month, that's how our cycles went so if I say C1 I mean the first 2 months of the school year (Aug.-Oct) During C1 and for most of C2 I didn't hear nor want to hear anything of these >!assholes!<because they pissed me off in a time far-far away.

SECTION 3:

Behind the happy-go-lucky mask of their ignorance something sinister was happening behind the scenes. Me and one of the kids from my new friend group, well call him Ted, had found out about a sort-of cultish gatherings that took place in the back of the field. The guys took full on small trees and other things like shovels from the greenhouse, which was not cool, but it would quickly be overshadowed by the bigger issue. That bigger issue was >!dicks!<because they had said to me,""To join the club you gotta >!piss!< through the fence"" that bordered their club. The only problem was that they had commited a literal crime, and not just public indecency, they had >!pissed!< on private property that bordered the school. It's kinda ironic that that house bordered a church that was maybe a 1 minute walk from the school and bordered a different part of the school that wasn't the field.

SECTION 4:

After noticing that these problems were there, Ted went to do some field-investigation on his own terms and would be >!'sexually assulted' - Ted!< by another member named, I don't know, Daniel, Daniel was a new-kid to our middle school, we were all in 6th grade though. What I mean by >!SA!<was Daniel grabbed his own >!cock!<and then proceeded to grab Ted's family jewels IYKYK, while he was investigating.

19687,1hgp161,post,I was SA'd by a friend of a friend then made to walk down the aisle with her,"I've told this story to a few people before, but never in this amount of detail and never described it as SA. I've been going through some shit recently and trying to take an honest look back at things in my life and I think about this a lot and feel it is important to call it what it is and admit that I was raped.

Many years ago, I had just gotten out of a very toxic relationship. My best friend calls me up and tells me to come to a party at his place to cheer me up. He lived quite far at the time and I decided to make a trip out of it and go see him.

I get there and we go get lunch. He's joking about getting me laid and I'm not really into it. Later we go back to his house and his girlfriend is there with one of her friends. He introduces me to the friend. I know immediately where this is going and I go through all the pleasantries, say hello, we chat a bit. He pulls me aside and asks me what I think of her and tells me I should go for it. I say that I just want to enjoy the party and that's not really what I'm here for. He continues to push that I should ""blow off some steam.""

The party gets started and it's clear that she's probably gotten a similar pep talk as she starts to follow me around. I try to be nice but never say outright ""I'm not interested."" I move between groups, try to talk with other people. Eventually she goes inside and I don't see her for a while. I think at this point I'm in the clear. I eventually get really drunk and black out.

I wake up the next morning in my friend's bedroom naked with her next to me. I have no memory of what happened. She's still asleep. There's used condoms on the floor next to the bed. The bedroom door is wide open. The bedroom window faces out into the back yard where the party was. I get up and go to the bathroom to take a shower. She walks in and casually gets into the shower with me. She presses up against me and grabs my penis. I can't remember what I said, but something to the effect of not being in the mood. She doesn't stop touching me and I start to get hard. I sort of freeze at this point and don't know what to do. She kisses me, bends over in front of me and asks me to fuck her. I do it. I don't know why. I wanted it to be over. I couldn't finish. It takes a long time. She talks about how amazing last night was. I get out of the shower, get dry and dressed as quick as a I can and leave.

I get out into the living room and my buddy is there with a few people who must have also slept over after the party. They're all looking at me with grins. I just wanted to leave. My buddy congratulates me, there's a few comments about ""putting on a show."" I feel sick. I feel angry. She comes out and everyone starts talking about getting lunch. I say that I have a long drive and I have to go. She looks upset. I practically run out of the room with my stuff and leave.

Years later, my friend is getting married to that girlfriend. I'm invited to be a groomsman. It crosses my mind that she might be a bridesmaid. I've sort of moved on at this point. I don't want to see her, but the thought of her being there doesn't deeply upset me in any sort of way. I don't ask if she's in the wedding. Once I get there for rehearsal, I see her there. She's a bridesmaid. We're lined up by height and are paired together to walk down the aisle. I don't remember if we said anything to each other, we must have. I don't bring it up, it's been so long, why say anything. I stay away from her outside of rehearsal and the ceremony. While we're getting ready, the day of the wedding, my buddy points it out to me: ""Isn't it funny that you're both walking down the aisle together?"" I feel this overwhelming hurt and rage. I get through the wedding and we more or less stopped talking after that.

I think for years I struggled with this because of what happened the morning after. We had sex while I was of sound mind. I think I always thought that sort of invalidated what happened the night before. But I recognize now that even that wasn't truly consensual. That me getting black out drunk didn't make it okay.

I don't know what I want to get out of posting this. Even writing this all out feels like it helped. I'm tired. I'm hurting.

EDIT: I no longer talk to this friend for a lot of reasons. I recently started getting therapy, also for a lot of reasons. I haven't approached this experience with my therapist yet. I'm not doing great, but I'm trying to get better. Thank you to those showing concern.

EDIT 2: There are a lot of people commenting that she may not have been of sound mind either and could have been pressured, didn't have ill intent, etc. I realize that using the word ""rape"" very much vilifies this woman and even I don't know if that's fair which is a big part of my struggle with this. I genuinely know nothing about what happened that night. The last thing I remember was sitting on the ground and asking someone to get me water. What I mostly have come to accept is that this was a traumatic thing for me that impacted my future relationships. I see my friends who didn't look out for me as the shitty ones here. However, I stand by ""rape"" being the right word because I don't see any version of what happened where my ""friends"" were not involved in those events even after I had made clear I was not interested.","I was SA'd by a friend of a friend then made to walk down the aisle with her I've told this story to a few people before, but never in this amount of detail and never described it as SA.

19689,1gx8hdy,post,Mon copain n'est plus du tout sûr de ses sentiments et j'en souffre énormément !!,"Bonjour à tous... 

Tout d'abord j'aimerais contextualiser la chose : moi et ""mon copain"", je ne sais même plus si j'ai lla légitimité de lappeller comme ça, somme 2 mecs et on s'est rencontré à nos 16ans quand on était en seconde (dans le même lycée et même classe) puis on était dans le même groupe d'amis et enfin en début de terminale, après l'avoir aimé depuis le premier jour, je lui ai avoué mes sentiments le 5 Oct.23 et on s'est mit ensemble le 31.Oct23. 

Tout s'est passé super facilement, moi j'étais tellement heureux d'être avec lui parce que c'était quelqu'un qui a fait l'objet de mes pensées TOUS LES JOURS pendant 2 looongues années, j'étais un peu comme obsédé et de son côté, il est tombé aussi assez rapidemet amoureux, même si j'ai d'abord dû faire en sorte qu'on soit ""meilleurs amis"", puis après il a commencé a avoir des sentiments sur moi quand je lui ai dit que j'étais vraiment follement amoureux de quelqu'un. L'année de Terminale s'est SUPER bien passée, tout était beau et magnifique : on s'aimait vraiment. 

En millieu de terminale soit environ 5mois après qu'on soit en couple, j'ai commencé à me demander si je l'aimais encore et si j'étais pas amoureux mais juste ""passionné"" ; et j'ai vraiment failli le quitter mais j'ai tout gardé pour moi et pendant 3semaines j'y ai réfléchis et j'ai décidé de rester puis selon moi c'est à ce moment que je suis passé de l""amour passionnel au vrai Amour. Mais maintenant c'est lui... 

Actuellement on est étudiants à 100Km de distance (moi à Poitiers en tant qu'étudiant en Médecine et lui à Tours en tant qu'étudiant en Prépa Ingénieur) donc autant vous dire que nos emplois du temps et nos réévisions sont BLINDES et vraiment TRES CHARGES à tous deux. On ne parlait que très rarement (environ 30mins MAXIMUM par jours, on a pas le temps) et on ne se voit vraiment jamais. Je suis déjà allé chez lui par surprise juste pour le voir 10mins (113Km et 4h de route aller-retour parce que je ne prends pas l'autoroute et mes parents n'apprécieraient pas que j'aille le voir). En Mai.24 il a avoué à ses parent qu'il sortait avec un garçon, avec moi. Et maintenant je regrette amèrement de ne pas les avoir rencontrés quand il avait envie de me présenter à eux. J'étais très très gêné à l'idée de rencontrer ses parents, d'autant plus qu'on est 2 garçons donc c'est moins normal, habituel quoi. 

Ce 6.Oct 2024, il y a maintenant 5semaines, il me confie qu'il ne sait plus s'il m'aime et qu'il est totalement perdu. Je l'appelle, m'effondre en pleurs et pense à prendre des médicaments pour ""partir"" s'il décidait de me quitter (Je ne le ferais jamais, c'était vraiment sous l'onde de choc ne vous inquiétez pas, jamais je ne le ferais !!). Depuis cette révélation, j'ai énormément souffert, pendant 3 semaines à penser tout le temps à ça, à pleurer et à me dire ce que je ferais sans lui, on parlait en effet souvent de quand on se mariera, d'avoir une voiture, d'habiter dans telle ou telle ville et de prendre un chien... En bref, on se projetait vraiment dans le futur ensemble ! J'ai quasiment pas révisé pendant ces 3 semaines tellement j'étais mal et me suis replié sur les réseaux sociaux à scroller toute la journée. 

Alors vient ensuite une grande période où chaque jours je l'inonde d'amour, d'affection et lui demande sans-cesse s'il m'aime encore et plus vers quoi penchent ses pensées ""ça penche plus vers le non ou le oui ?"" lui ais-je répété une 30aines de fois. Il m'a dit qu'il se sentait vraiment très très mal de me voir souffrir comme ça et que je lui mettais la pression pour décider et donc que ça le poussait à dire que non, il voulait qu'on se quitte.
On s'est déjà dit qu'on faisait des pauses ou qu'on se quittait 2-3 fois mais rien n'y fait, on est ""toujours"" ensemble 

Ces 2 dernières semaines et plus amplement depuis cette date du 6.Oct (ça faisait vraiment pile 1an) j'ai énormément appris sur moi et je me sens vraiment changé, j'ai juste envie de prendre soin et d'aimer ceux que j'aime...Lui compris. Il est vrai qu'avant quand il partait dans un bar et qu'il me prévenait, j'étais très énervé parce qu'on ne prennait pas de temps pour parler et quand on pouvait, il partait donc je l'engueulais. Maintenant, je lui souhaite sincèrement de bien profiter et je suis fièr de lui parce que c'est aussi comme ça que j'ai changé. Il m'a dit qu'il appréciait que j'ai changé et que ça lui rendait le choix ""encore plus difficile"" ; d'autant plus que maintenant je ne lui demande plus du tout si ça penche plus vers le ""non"" ou vers le ""oui"" parce que je sais qu'il est TOTALEMENT perdu et qu'il ne sait toujours pas quoi faire ni penser. J'avais aussi vu sur internet en masqués des recherches du type ""Je n'ai plus de désirs pour mon copain, que faire"" ou ""mon copain n'est pas mon style"" ; il m'avait aussi confié qu'il ne me trouvait pas ouf physiquement alors qu'il disait tout le contraire avant. ça m'avait vraimenr blessé au plus profond de moi, j'ai mit toute ma source de bonheur en lui et maintenant qu'il part, je vois mon bonheur partir en lui aussi. 

Donc la seule chose que je fais c'est d'écrire de beaux et doux messages, attentionnés ou juste sur mes réflexions de ce qu'est l'Amour etc... Je lui donne énormément d'amour et il trouve ça très très mignon. Il me le dit d'ailleurs très souvent : ""OOh, tu es vraiment très très mignon"" pourtant ça fait 2mois que je n'ai eu AUCUNS ""je t'aime"" et les rares fois où je lui ai demandé de me le dire, il me répondait ""mais je ne peux pas te le dire si je n'en suis pas sûr, je ne veux pas te mentir..."". 

Je me sens blessé à chaque fois et pourtant je reste ; je puise vraiment tout l'amour que j'ai en moi et pour moi juste pour lui donner et moi ça fait 5semaines que je ne reçois vraiment R-I-E-N en amour. Je vis juste pour les quelques ""Moooooh, tu es vraiment adorable et mignon"" et les émojis ""☺️"" et ""😘"" qu'il m'envoie encore. J'attend son bonne nuit et le fait qu'il répondes à mes messages envoyés depuis 8h30 tous les soirs, jusqu'à me coucher à 23h00 alors que je me réveille à 5h00 mais bon, je l'aime. 

Donc me voilà, totalement perdu : dès fois je me dis que je ferais mieux d'avoir quelqu'un qui m'aime vraiment et qui sait ce qu'il veut mais bon... Ces pensées partent vite pour devenir ""Mais je l'aime donc je reste"". On peut aussi dire qu'il me fait rester, il me donne un peu d'attention, mais pas trop pour faire planer le doute et il m'a assuré que si on se quittait, il voudrait vraiment qu'on devienne amis parce que je suis quelqu'un de très important pour lui et il tient à moi, il ne veut pas que je parte, il veut que, dans l'éventualité où on se quitte, je sois son meilleur amis. Alors qu'on aura passé 1an ensemble à s'aimer, faire l'amour, se dire absolument tout. Il me dit que je suis quelqu'un de vraiment très très bien et il ne veut surtout pas me faire de mal et il a aussi un peu peur de regretter dans sa vie s'il me quittait mais aussi que, s'il restait, passer à côté de quelque-chose.
Je me suis aussi mit mon père et mes soeurs à dos en leur avouant que je sortais avec un garçon. Mais je l'aime donc je l'ai assumé et j'avais aucuns regrets. 

Mais s'il part et que je le revois avec quelqu'un dans sa vie, je ne le supporterais pas, je suis persudé qu'en étant plus vieux, même en couple je me dirais ""et si on ne s'était pas quitté, on serait plus heureux ?"". J'avais vraiment imaginé ma vie avec lui et tout était assuré. 

Je suis désolé d'avoir écrit autant mais j'vais beoin de conseils, de parler, de me confier. J'avais besoin de savoir quoi faire et savoir quoi lui dire. 

Je vous remercie sincèrement d'avoir tout lu jusqu'à là, vous êtes de bonnes personne, vraiment !!!","Mon copain n'est plus du tout sûr de ses sentiments et j'en souffre énormément !! Bonjour à tous...

19691,1gww0vy,post,TW// sa and r*pe … What sparked me to be an addict,"I was maybe 6 I remember my family was having a party/gathering they’re all Hispanic so these parties go for a long time. My cousin who’s maybe 2-4 years older than me,I actually don’t know his age exactly, came into my living room where I was and asked me to play with him and I was excited I’m the only girl in my group of cousins I have a handful of cousins and they’re all mostly boys I have 1 cousin who is a girl but she was in high school at the time so my cousins don’t always want to hangout with me. Anyways, I go to his room and he sits me down on his bed and tells me I need to be quiet and next thing I know he’s touching my private parts and grinding on me but our clothes never came off. I don’t remember a lot but I remember that and I remember he made it seem okay like it’s not a bad thing to do this together but it had to be a secret. And then anytime my family had a party I would be excited like I wonder if my cousin wants to play with me today. No one knows about it I never told anyone bc when I realized how bad that was, I was older and I feel like since I didn’t say no and we were close in age maybe it’s not that bad and I don’t wanna hurt my aunt and having her know this. I don’t know I just feel embarrassed and guilty.

In this point of time I am now maybe 7 I had a friend who lived on the ground floor of my apartment complex she once came up to play dolls with me and one day she said we should play in my closet and she started to play with herself and I asked what she was doing and she said she does that and it feels good and I should try it. I didn’t know what to do so she started to touch me and since my cousin does this to me I didn’t think it was bad. Then she started to lick me… if u get what I mean and I was scared but I didn’t want to scream for reason so I just let it happen. And then my mom came in my room and she stopped and pretended to play with my dolls and my mom opens the closet and asks why we were in here and my friend pretended like all we did was play dolls. My mom I think knew something was wrong bc she sat me down on my bed that night and asked me about it and asked me if she touched me inappropriately and I lied and said no and to leave me alone. I don’t know why I lied I feel like I didn’t want my friend to get in trouble. I stopped seeing her bc her family moved shortly after. 

In this point of time I am maybe 14 I moved away from most of my family. My parents decided to move us to the south since cost of living was cheaper and better hopes of owning a home than living in a small apartment. My mom decided I should go visit my family for the summer. I was so excited to see some of cousins and my aunts and uncles and being around my culture. However I forgot about that one cousin. I was in my aunts apartment for the whole summer and I learn the one cousin moved out, can’t remember if it was college or just In general, so it would be me and my two little cousins. Summer was great we had so much fun I loved being with my family. Then my cousin came for a surprise visit and gave me a hug as if everything was normal. I thought maybe he forgot what he used to do to me when I was little. So I thought okay I’ll forget about it too and maybe we can be normal. And we all sat on the couch watching YouTube videos it was whatever my two little cousins wanted to watch. We all were under a big blanket and then he started rubbing my leg. And again I froze like all emotions left my body and I felt nothing. I didn’t move I didn’t yell I didn’t blink just nothing. But that was it. I was scared to sleep. I remember me and some cousins went to the city and got comedy tickets and we couldn’t go in bc my one cousin was too young so we decided to go back tomorrow except it would only my be me and that one cousin. I wanted so bad to just be normal everyone else is normal why can’t we be normal? Then my aunt left us two alone since she had work and we were about to leave to go to a comedy show. Except we didn’t I was getting ready and I was scared I couldn’t ever do my makeup I felt nervous then he came up behind me and kissed my neck. I said “what are you doing?” And he said “just let me do this shut up” and I was too scared to fight back I was too scared to yell I just froze in fear and then I just went emotionless. Ugh I can remember his smell I don’t even know how to describe it but I can remember it. Remembering it makes me want to vomit. He had sex with me. I didn’t make a sound I was just numb and emotionless the whole time. At one time he wanted me to be on top and I said no and he was getting upset and grabbed my neck and I felt like he was going to hurt me in different ways so I gave in and got on top. When it was finally over I remember having tears run down my face but I was crying I felt nothing. I hated myself. I didn’t want to ruin lives like my aunt. She immigrated here got citizenship married a man had kids her husband cheated on her and then she divorced and he’s not the greatest dad. She’s a single mom who works so hard for her kids she loves them so much and she’s such a good mom she’s truly an amazing woman. I just don’t want to ruin her life. If I told someone they either won’t believe me then hate me or believe me and I ruin the family. I remember being in the shower for as long as I could scrubbing my body and no matter what I did I wasn’t clean. And everything around me felt filthy. I hate myself so much for not saying anything. 

This sparked my addiction. 

I started vaping which doesn’t seem so bad for a 14-15 year old. Then I was smoking weed, then I was self harming, then I started taking xans I almost overdosed on xans I was in high school my eyes were rolled back and I couldn’t make sentences I was mumbling I couldn’t keep my head up I was wandering the halls barley walking my friend said I looked like a zombie the way I walked I know this bc my friend took a video of me, I did cigarettes, I did coke, I did shrooms, I did molly, I took a random substance idk what it was someone gave it to me and I took it all I know is it looked like a flinstone vitamin but made u feel like u did coke, and I did oxy. From 14-24 years old. I am currently 24 and I have never ever told anyone about this ever. To this day I scrub my body and I still hate myself for allowing this. Only bright side is I got sober earlier this year in February. My boyfriend is just a great person and he deserves to be with someone who’s sober and more stable. So I got myself together ish. It’s a struggle every day. He and I are together for 4 years and I’ve never told him about this. I think I’m taking this with me to my grave. This here is my first time getting it off my chest and I definitely am not snot dripping crying. Worst part I have 3 more rape and sexual assault stories but I’ll get into that maybe another time. Thanks for reading ig.  ","TW// sa and r*pe … What sparked me to be an addict I was maybe 6 I remember my family was having a party/gathering they’re all Hispanic so these parties go for a long time. My cousin who’s maybe 2-4 years older than me,I actually don’t know his age exactly, came into my living room where I was and asked me to play with him and I was excited I’m the only girl in my group of cousins I have a handful of cousins and they’re all mostly boys I have 1 cousin who is a girl but she was in high school at the time so my cousins don’t always want to hangout with me. Anyways, I go to his room and he sits me down on his bed and tells me I need to be quiet and next thing I know he’s touching my private parts and grinding on me but our clothes never came off. I don’t remember a lot but I remember that and I remember he made it seem okay like it’s not a bad thing to do this together but it had to be a secret. And then anytime my family had a party I would be excited like I wonder if my cousin wants to play with me today. No one knows about it I never told anyone bc when I realized how bad that was, I was older and I feel like since I didn’t say no and we were close in age maybe it’s not that bad and I don’t wanna hurt my aunt and having her know this. I don’t know I just feel embarrassed and guilty.

In this point of time I am now maybe 7 I had a friend who lived on the ground floor of my apartment complex she once came up to play dolls with me and one day she said we should play in my closet and she started to play with herself and I asked what she was doing and she said she does that and it feels good and I should try it. I didn’t know what to do so she started to touch me and since my cousin does this to me I didn’t think it was bad. Then she started to lick me… if u get what I mean and I was scared but I didn’t want to scream for reason so I just let it happen. And then my mom came in my room and she stopped and pretended to play with my dolls and my mom opens the closet and asks why we were in here and my friend pretended like all we did was play dolls. My mom I think knew something was wrong bc she sat me down on my bed that night and asked me about it and asked me if she touched me inappropriately and I lied and said no and to leave me alone. I don’t know why I lied I feel like I didn’t want my friend to get in trouble. I stopped seeing her bc her family moved shortly after. 

In this point of time I am maybe 14 I moved away from most of my family. My parents decided to move us to the south since cost of living was cheaper and better hopes of owning a home than living in a small apartment. My mom decided I should go visit my family for the summer. I was so excited to see some of cousins and my aunts and uncles and being around my culture. However I forgot about that one cousin. I was in my aunts apartment for the whole summer and I learn the one cousin moved out, can’t remember if it was college or just In general, so it would be me and my two little cousins. Summer was great we had so much fun I loved being with my family. Then my cousin came for a surprise visit and gave me a hug as if everything was normal. I thought maybe he forgot what he used to do to me when I was little. So I thought okay I’ll forget about it too and maybe we can be normal. And we all sat on the couch watching YouTube videos it was whatever my two little cousins wanted to watch. We all were under a big blanket and then he started rubbing my leg. And again I froze like all emotions left my body and I felt nothing. I didn’t move I didn’t yell I didn’t blink just nothing. But that was it. I was scared to sleep. I remember me and some cousins went to the city and got comedy tickets and we couldn’t go in bc my one cousin was too young so we decided to go back tomorrow except it would only my be me and that one cousin. I wanted so bad to just be normal everyone else is normal why can’t we be normal? Then my aunt left us two alone since she had work and we were about to leave to go to a comedy show. Except we didn’t I was getting ready and I was scared I couldn’t ever do my makeup I felt nervous then he came up behind me and kissed my neck. I said “what are you doing?” And he said “just let me do this shut up” and I was too scared to fight back I was too scared to yell I just froze in fear and then I just went emotionless. Ugh I can remember his smell I don’t even know how to describe it but I can remember it. Remembering it makes me want to vomit. He had sex with me. I didn’t make a sound I was just numb and emotionless the whole time. At one time he wanted me to be on top and I said no and he was getting upset and grabbed my neck and I felt like he was going to hurt me in different ways so I gave in and got on top. When it was finally over I remember having tears run down my face but I was crying I felt nothing. I hated myself. I didn’t want to ruin lives like my aunt. She immigrated here got citizenship married a man had kids her husband cheated on her and then she divorced and he’s not the greatest dad. She’s a single mom who works so hard for her kids she loves them so much and she’s such a good mom she’s truly an amazing woman. I just don’t want to ruin her life. If I told someone they either won’t believe me then hate me or believe me and I ruin the family. I remember being in the shower for as long as I could scrubbing my body and no matter what I did I wasn’t clean. And everything around me felt filthy. I hate myself so much for not saying anything. 

This sparked my addiction.

At the time I was too scared to press charges, but after a year I was ready. Unfortunately, since I didn't do a rape kit or have any solid evidence my case was dropped. A year after my SA, I was still experiencing all the emotions anger, self hatred, etc. I wanted to find peace and in doing so I got really into spirituality. However looking back I was using it to put more hate into this world. One day I had the idea to send my rapist a haunted doll. I don't know what evoked this idea but I spent hours on eBay to find the perfect haunted doll. I eventually found this demonic haunted doll. The seller claimed that the doll was used in demonic rituals and that the demon was extremely dangerous. The seller wanted to make sure I had experience in the paranormal field and took care of other haunted object in the past. I just lied out of my ass and said I did and made up stories about my ""haunted doll collection"". When I purchased the doll I put the address as my rapists (I knew his full name so after a quick google search his address popped up) and waited for it to arrive.
A week after the parcel shipped to his house my rapist had gotten into a terrible motorcycle accident losing his entire left leg and a year after his accident people from my hometown were telling my mother that he is extremely paranoid and had been dealing with substance issues.
When hearing the news of both events I was in denial, but after unblocking my rapist and looking through his highlights on instagram I saw that fucking doll. The doll was propped up on his dresser out in the open which was a problem because the seller I bought it from made sure l knew that the doll HAD TO BE CONTAINED. I'm 19 now and I feel so much guilt. I've devoted the last two years of my life to Jesus Christ and forgave my rapist. By far this is the worst thing l've ever done and the only person who has heard of my wrong doing was during confessionals at church. I don't know how to live with myself knowing I ruined someone's life. Instead of breaking the chain, I continued it.","I bought a demonic doll on ebay and sent it to my rapist.

J’ai l’impression de ne plus exister pour une raison quelconque, les cours me stressent, la solitude est mon meilleur compagnon, et le désordre dans ma tête et dans mes cours me pousse à fixer longuement la fenêtre, en me demandant si le saut pourrait être ma libération.

J’ai compris que j’étais malheureuse. Je ne sais pas organiser mon argent et je passe le plus clair de mon temps à me blâmer. Je n’apprends jamais de mes erreurs, je suis bête, lâche, des défauts qui construisent ma personnalité.

Je n’aime pas les gens à Paris, surtout ceux de mon université. Des demandes Instagram pour ne rien dire, voilà ce qui les résume.

Mais je ne peux m’en prendre qu’à moi-même, je suis telle que je suis.

Je sais reconnaître mes qualités : je me considère assez traditionnelle, loyale comme une chienne, généreuse quand j’en ai envie. Je n’ai même pas de gentillesse en moi, je le sais, j’aime les intérêts et le confort que les autres peuvent m’apporter.

Je suis aussi très théâtrale, cela m’arrive souvent, pour être honnête, d’avoir des rêveries compulsives où j’imagine quelqu’un d’autre à ma place.

Tout le monde est si déterminé, cela m’impressionne. Je n’ai espoir en rien, je ne ressens que de la peine, et tout me donne envie de partir avec de l’argent, d’être amoureuse et de compléter ma perversité.

J’espère que quelqu’un réussit à me comprendre. Je sais que je suis assez dure, parfois manipulatrice dans mes ""je t’aime"".

Quel paradoxe, moi qui ai peur que les gens ne soient pas honnêtes avec moi.

Rien ne me manque, juste des regards d’admiration et d’amour.

Regardez-moi, je suis peut-être une chienne, mais je mérite de l’amour.

L’espoir dans les yeux des gens me dégoûte, car je n’arrive pas à espérer. Je suis lâche, rappelons-le.

J’aimerais que quelqu’un d’inconnu lise ce que je viens d’écrire sur ma chienne de vie.

Je n’aime personne, à part une nouvelle amie que je me suis faite, Luna.

Je pourrais parler des heures de mon amour pour elle, elle est si douce, si compréhensive, et sans vices, tout le contraire de moi.

Je l’aime tellement que je suis prête à changer pour elle.

Être une chienne n’est jamais simple à changer, mais je pense que par amour, je peux le faire.

Elle me manque constamment, même quand elle est là ou que je sais que je vais partir.

Tout est si simple avec elle, je n’ai même pas besoin de me cacher dans mes sentiments.

Les gens autour de moi sont trop sensibles à tout, et cela me donne envie de créer une guerre pour qu’ils se rendent compte qu’ils n’ont pas une chienne de vie comme certaines personnes mourantes.

Et si je mourais ?

Ma mère ne me comprend même pas. Elle prétend m’aimer, mais dans ses yeux, je ne suis qu’une stabilité constante qui la suivra dans l’éternité.

Peut-on se lasser de sa mère ?

Est-ce que je l’aime comme je le prétends ?

Je sais que j’ai envie d’être dans ses bras.

Je crois que j’ai envie de pleurer.

Dans une bibliothèque où mes cheveux bruns sont gonflés par le temps capricieux de la ville lumière.

Les gens travaillent autour de moi, quelqu’un de beau à côté pense, l’autre lit en se bouchant les oreilles, sûrement ennuyé par mon clavier soumis à mes doigts en détresse.

Je crois que cela m’a fait du bien. J’hésite à le poster sur Reddit. Qui me dit que dans 10 ans je ne serai pas connue et que cela ne servira pas de preuve que je suis une chienne.

Ils n’ont pas tort.

Mais finalement, j’ai envie d’être amoureuse ou de me jeter.

Je suis capable d’aimer, mais seulement dans les actions, mon cœur n’en sait rien.

Assez paradoxal.

Je pourrais tromper, j’aime les regards sur moi, l’attirance que je peux susciter après un long discours discuté avec quelqu’un.

Je n’ai même plus la même créativité qu’avant.

Je me base sur ce que je sais et non plus sur ce que je peux créer.

Peut-être parce que cela me dégoûte, vu que ça vient de moi.

J’aimerais tester le sexe, mais j’ai peur de l’abandon.

Peut-être le sexe amoureux, mais j’ai aussi peur de l’abandon.

Putain, quelle chienne.

Je me dégoûte.

Je sais que je suis une chienne, alors faire plaisir aux autres est devenu une priorité pour moi, comme une salope qui attend son prince charmant.

Quelle chienne je suis.","ma chienne de vie en version corrigé dsl à l'avance de la lecture  **Confession sur ce que je ressens :**

J’ai l’impression de ne plus exister pour une raison quelconque, les cours me stressent, la solitude est mon meilleur compagnon, et le désordre dans ma tête et dans mes cours me pousse à fixer longuement la fenêtre, en me demandant si le saut pourrait être ma libération.

Je vais la faire courte. Je suis fille unique et mes parents sont divorcés et mon père remarié. . Mes relations avec tout le monde sont niquel j'ai vraiment rien à dire à ce sujet.

Je fais mes études très loin de chez moi, ma mère vit donc seule à la maison. J'ai pris l'habitude de l'appeler le soir pendant que je travaille 1h ou 2h histoire de lui tenir compagnie et de lui raconter un peu mes journées et vice versa. Elle aime bien ça.

J'ai eu ma mamie au téléphone qui m'a dit qu'ils sont sortis en famille à la mer hier (je n'étais pas au courant qu'une sortie était organisée) et que ma mère avait refusé sans donner de justification.

C'est pas la première fois qu'elle le fait. C'est même extrêmement fréquent. Elle a refusé le Nouvel An avec ses cousines, refusé un repas un soir chez sa sœur etc... Sans aucune justification. Au lieu de ça, elle a passé sa journée au téléphone avec moi qui travaillais pendant des heures.

PS on ne se parle pas : je bosse et elle regarde la télé/fait le ménage....

19703,1f4b3gs,post,I was SA’d when I was younger. I lied to CPS to cover for my abuser because I couldn’t accept that it was inappropriate. ,"I regret lying to them everyday of my life. 

When I was a kid, my stepdad would touch me. It always happened when I was asleep. 

I was a really touchy feely kind of kid, all I ever wanted was attention. He gave me SO much of it. I loved it, and I loved him. He took care of me like my mother never did. Made sure I was eating healthy, staying active and keeping up on my violin practice. At nights we would cuddle. 

Eventually, I was sleeping in their bed every night. Him and my mom split up (for other reasons- I think) but I loved him! So I would stay with him during the week sometimes. We kept sleeping in the same bed. By this point, he was teaching me how to shower, shave and wear deodorant. Stuff my mom never cared to teach me! I didn’t think it was weird that he would be naked in the shower with me.

I’d wake up to his hand over my breast on top of my clothes. Or cupping my pubic area over my clothes. He would act like it was an accident but I didn’t think it was. So I tried to stop sleeping in the same bed. He would coerce me. I started waking up with his hands under my clothes. I hated it, but I loved him. And tried so hard to convince myself it wasn’t happening.

My stepdad called CPS on my mom because he thought my brother was being weird to me. My mom asked me if it was my stepdad being weird, and I told her no. After that I lied to 3 separate government employees (I’m assuming that’s what they were, I was so young) telling them he was never inappropriate to me. (My brother never touched me)

I hate myself everyday for not speaking up about what happened to me. That’s it. I kept a disgusting human out of jail and he still roams the earth. ","I was SA’d when I was younger.

19704,1bwqkzh,post,I remembered I abused my pets as a kid and I can’t live with myself,"I’m shaking with stomach pains as I write this, but if I don’t share it now I might actually not survive. The guilt has gotten too unbearable. I’m not looking for sympathy because I don’t deserve it. I know this will get tons of hate and that is all deserved. I’m the worst type of person in the world and I don’t know how or why it happened but I can’t live with myself anymore.

When I was a kid, young enough to not know any better but old enough that I should’ve I guess, I abused my pets, one cat and one dog. I won’t sugarcoat it, I occasionally used them for sexual gratification. I’m female so there was was no penetration of any kind, but I essentially used the warmth of their body and rubbed up against them. This went on for I think roughly two years, mostly with the cat. And I’m fucking disgusted by it. I hate myself every second that goes by. 

I never, ever thought what I was doing was animal abuse. I loved animals and I still do. But for some reason I thought what I was doing was harmless and wouldn’t affect the animals at all, that it was weird but not bad. When I got older and learned that what I did was bestiality and that it is animal abuse, I felt my body start to reject itself in a sense. I honestly can’t tell you why I did it. I don’t think I was ever sexually attracted to them, just curious and lonely and sexually frustrated. I had/have intrusive thoughts and couldn’t make them stop and decided to act on them out of desperation. Looking back I also suspect previous sexual encounters as a child (I’m hesitant to say SA, as I have experienced that relatively recently, karma I suppose) may have contributed to my skewed understanding of sex, consent, and morals as a whole. But NONE of this is an excuse. I didn’t even really connect the pieces until this year. 

It doesn’t matter though. I can’t tell anyone, can’t apologize to the animals because it’s been so long. I was able to convince my parents to send the cat away when I got older and I can only hope she found a better, more loving family, but I blame myself endlessly for letting it get to that point. I think my recent SA has made these memories come out of hiding, or at least is making me face the music. Because no matter what happened to me, I deserved it. I deserve every bad thing that happened and is going to happen to me, because how much more disgusting, more dangerous, more horribly morally fucked up can you get? People tell me I’m kind and a good person and deserve to be happy but they have no idea what I’ve done and how wrong they are. I’ve disappointed everyone, lied to everyone about who I truly am. It doesn’t matter how remorseful I am, how different I am today and how long ago it was, I can’t go back and change it. I did it, I’ll have always done it, and that makes me want to die more than anything. The only reason I haven’t is because I’m too scared of death.

To anyone who has taken the time to read all this: thank you, and I’m sorry. I hate the thought of exposing people to this fucked up shit, but I’m lost. I can’t lose my therapist, other counselors are on a waitlist, I can’t go to confession because I’m not religious and if I told my friends or family, I would lose every single one of them, and I’m too much of a coward to lose more people I care about in my life. I’m just so fucking sorry…","I remembered I abused my pets as a kid and I can’t live with myself I’m shaking with stomach pains as I write this, but if I don’t share it now I might actually not survive.

I deserve every bad thing that happened and is going to happen to me, because how much more disgusting, more dangerous, more horribly morally fucked up can you get? People tell me I’m kind and a good person and deserve to be happy but they have no idea what I’ve done and how wrong they are. I’ve disappointed everyone, lied to everyone about who I truly am. It doesn’t matter how remorseful I am, how different I am today and how long ago it was, I can’t go back and change it. I did it, I’ll have always done it, and that makes me want to die more than anything. The only reason I haven’t is because I’m too scared of death.

To anyone who has taken the time to read all this: thank you, and I’m sorry. I hate the thought of exposing people to this fucked up shit, but I’m lost. I can’t lose my therapist, other counselors are on a waitlist, I can’t go to confession because I’m not religious and if I told my friends or family, I would lose every single one of them, and I’m too much of a coward to lose more people I care about in my life. I’m just so fucking sorry…",157,107.0,2024-04-05 19:22,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1bwqkzh/i_remembered_i_abused_my_pets_as_a_kid_and_i_cant/,Offender
19705,17jfr3a,post,"I commited SA on a girl and can't forgive my self, I don't know if she realise what I did","This post is not fake nor it is a ragebait, if you're going to insult me I will ask you to at least read the whole thing.

I'm really disgusted of my self, I can't believe that I did what I did. When I was 12 I was in a public swimming pool with some family, one of them was my cousin, she was 10. (writing this feels disgusting) at one point she was tired and ask for help to get to the ground, when I picked her up and while getting her to the edge I rubbed her, she giggled and said it tickled. this is it and I can't get it out of my head. What lead me to this ? at that time I just moved from a third world country to america, I came from a country where women are not respected, I grew there with friends and family always talking about women like trash and sexually reducing them. I believe my development was fucked, this was not healthy for  a child ans I shouldn't even had that perverted mine at that age. At that time I just thought it's hot to do what I did and didn't see the problem with it. Now I grew and I forged my morals, I became respectful and realised how flawed my world views were, I try to educate men about feminism and I hate guys who think how I used to think as adults. Today I just pray to every living god that she either don't remember this incident or just thinks I was tickeling her (not for my sake but for her own I don't to be the one who caused SA trauma and I want her to be healthy). I don't know what to do if I should even talk about it with her or continue to hope it's gone from her mind. Am I an SA'er for life or by changing I can say that it's not me that did it ? I'm consumed with guilt and hope she's okay. 

Edit : thanks to everyone for all the advice and for sharing your experiences. Some people are confused because I didn't want to go into details since we're talking about childs when I say rubbing it was my hand on her private part and through the clothes it was like a second and yes sadly it was intentional. I tried responding but my comments are getting auto deleted for some reason you can read some of them by going to my profile directly tho. I won't bring the subject to her since you advised me not to and I will try to navigate my remorses. I can tell you a story that I lived when I was 11 to maybe give you more insight in what kind of environment I grew in. I was invited by a 15 years old boy to an empty classroom after class to watch him masturbate in front of me, I watched the whole thing and wasn't even chocked I had a flawed and naive view I couldn't explain it. I used to be groped by boys because I looked feminine (because I had blue eyes and it was rare in my country ?) anyway I think all this led me to be totally fucked in the head, writing this it feels like it's surreal but I have to live with this sadly, have a great day and I hope you never hurt somebody like I did.

Edit 2 : No, I never posted this anywhere in the internet nor did I ever spoke about it to anyone, this is the very first time. I also still can't reply in the comments for some reason I would've liked talking to some of you but it's not possible sadly, I read every response thank you all.","I commited SA on a girl and can't forgive my self, I don't know if she realise what I did This post is not fake nor it is a ragebait, if you're going to insult me I will ask you to at least read the whole thing.

19706,16pq6vq,post,I fooled around with someone while we were both drunk,"Back in High School I went to a party and got drunk for the first time. I hadn’t been the party type, never got into trouble and wanted to relieve stress before jumping into college. At some point I was told that there was a train going on in a room and figured I’d jump in to finally have sex 

As I went into the room I saw it was just one other guy but in my opinion I thought it was just one at a time in the room or something. Anyways I go in and we fool around for a bit 

————————————————————————

THE SEX


For context the room was dark so while I know for certain she knew it’s a different guy coming in I’m not entirely sure if she saw my face 

What transpired was something that was less than 10 minutes. She’s kissing my body but I don’t want to kiss back, she tries giving me head but keeps biting my dick, and she lays down saying to fuck me n****

Now before I can even get a condom on correctly she says fuck me (friend’s name)

This was another black guy who looks nothing like me but who I was with at the party. It was then I knew I couldn’t continue with this and started to put my pants back on 

Right as I’m putting my belt on her friend comes into the room as she’s worried and I leave them alone.

————————————————————————

THE MORNING

Because I was drunk I didn’t bother driving and ended up staying the whole night. We came across each other in the kitchen and when I asked her about the other night she stated that I did nothing wrong and that she was fine. Nevertheless I’ve felt guilty since and feel as if I’ve SA’d her regardless  

————————————————————————

PRESENT DAY

It’s been years since and I feel like I need to own up to a crime even though we were both drunk and she told me I did nothing wrong. I messaged her on FB summarizing all this and saying she can decide where to go from here. I’m remorseful but still curious as to whether this constitutes SA or not","I fooled around with someone while we were both drunk Back in High School I went to a party and got drunk for the first time.

19707,trw61g,post,I had my phone stolen by bullies but ended up punishing the least guilty person.,"Now I know I’m not technically wrong for what happened but it genuinely still upsets me that this happened. 

Back in grade 10 (sophomore year for Americans) I was sadly in science class with a guy who was mad that I dumped him after dating for a week in grade 8. His friends were also in the class and I tried to ignore them. I got partnered with them at our science desk because no one else in the class liked me lol. So I tried to get along with them but they just seemed to want to annoy me. I took most of them as jokes like they would hide my pen or book.

It became more and more extreme things until they covered my iPhone 6 (at the time it was the second latest phone. This is important) with play dough that we were meant to use for our activity in class. 
I laughed it off but was really annoyed because it took ages for me to clean the speakers out and they didn’t work well after that. 

Now for the actual issue. 
There was a three guys involved. We will just call them L, S and M
L was the salty guy I dated for a week
M was Ls best friend at the time
And S was just a quiet dude who just wanted friends 

One day I wanted to get my work done and just ignored them all. L and M did NOT like this. They constantly wanted to get my attention and were pestering me for half the lesson until they just stopped. 
I was thankful but then at the end of the class I realised my phone was gone. I laughed it off initially and told them to give it back. They both said “we don’t know where it is” 
I began to freak out and get annoyed and told them firmly to give my phone back. 
They told me they told S to hide it on the side tables of the class and I looked there but it wasn’t there. 
They both looked at S and he looked really worried. 
I started freaking out and asking them to stop playing and find my phone or I’m telling the teacher (I know I was that type of person).
The teacher had just come back from the storage room and noticed all 4 of us still there and asked what’s going on. I told him and he made all 3 clean the room but I objected and said S wouldn’t have done this if L and M hasn’t have told him to. The teacher let S off with a warning while L and M shot daggers at me as they were made to clean the classroom.

My phone was NOT found and I cried to my parents about it and they were obviously pissed. We were in no way well off and I paid for the phone with my own money that I got from working (it was $600). 

We spoke to the school but L and M convinced the principal that they just told S to hide it and they didn’t know he would lose it. The principal was not as forgiving as my teacher and blamed it all on S.
His parents were called and his parents, my parents and the vice principal had a meeting at the school. S was crying and I felt so bad because he did not deserve this as much as L and M did. 
The problem was that I really did need the money from him and even with my request to have the other boys pay for a third each, the father of S outright said no and said that his son needs to learn from his mistakes. 
My parents tried to comfort me when I said that I felt bad but I still feel bad to this day. 
L and M are absolute jerks and I have an even worse story to share about L and M threatening to SA me to the point that I didn’t feel safe going to school for a week. 
I honestly want to reach out to S even though we are 20 now and say that I feel bad but maybe it was such a small moment in his life. This may seem so petty and small in comparison to most of these posts but I am really pissed that the small guy got punished instead of the real assholes.","I had my phone stolen by bullies but ended up punishing the least guilty person.

19708,dfzc8j,post,I tried to miscarry my baby and hurt her permanently,"When I was 15, I got myself pregnant unintentionally. I was a very promiscuous horny teenager and I wasn't exactly safe about it. Sometimes I used condoms, sometimes I didn't. I got really worried when I started experiencing the usual symptoms of morning headaches and nausea and skipped my period, so I took a pregnancy test and what I feared was true, I was pregnant.


I had no idea how to react to this. For one I was utterly terrified and I wanted to get rid of it. In a way it felt parasitic, the thing inside me with the power to fuck my life up. I have very Christian parents who would have disowned me for having an abortion, but I knew they would actually love to raise this kid. However, I hated the idea. I had problems with eating at the time and didn't want to gain the pregnancy weight and I just didn't want a child.


I guess I'm making excuses, even now. I started a smoking habit very promptly, since I'd heard in science lessons that one of the effects of smoking can be miscarriage. I barely ate at all, and if I did I threw it up, all in the hopes of starving it as if I was trying to get rid of a fever. It didn't work. I gave birth to her far too early and as a result she is blind. I gave her away and haven't heard from her since, she's 8 by now. My parents were surprisingly supportive and I got the help I needed for my eating disorder and I still go to regular therapy. I just had to get it off my chest.


Edit: I've realised now that this confession has come across as unremorseful. It was hard writing it, and as a result I focused more on what happened than my emotions. I want to make it clear that I really really regret my actions. It's very hard to live with what I've done, and when I was 17 I attempted suicide because I simply couldn't handle it any longer. What I've done to my child tears me apart every day. I still have nightmares, I still can't sleep at night. I can't tell you how many times I've wished and prayed to go back in time. However, I've focused on improving myself through therapy and I am training to be a nurse to help children. I know that doesn't make up for it, but I'm trying hard to be better.


Edit 2: This is NOT the way to deal with this situation. First of all, always always always use contraception unless you are willing to accept the responsibility of a child, which is a life long commitment. If you're a woman, don't trust the man to bring it each time and keep it in a safe, secure location. Bring your own condoms, get on the pill, get an implant, whatever works for you. If you do get pregnant, don't be afraid to reach out for help. Speak to your doctor or teacher you world. If you feel like you can't talk to your parents, but if you do think you can speak to them don't feel ashamed. Don't do what I did. Getting pregnant is not the end of the world. Don't let it be the end of yours.

19709,c537c4,post,I tried to console a middle schooler through her sex orientation.,"The girl Im talking about in this post whoch we will call SA

     I started taking the bus to get home from middle school halfway through the year which left me in a tight spot but I fell on my feet and made tons of new friends on the bus and found my place through the good  the bad and the ugly. Their was this one girl SA she always ised to try to make fun of me, she'd call me ""stalker boy"" when I looked back at her group to figure out what was happening. To defend myself they were the typical girls in the back of the bus, always yelling talking about drama or saying weird things, yet I was the bad guy for wondering why these girls were raising hell on the bus? They were the centar of both drama and wtf moments on that bus.

          one day SA just sat on the bus emergancy escape and yelled at anybody whovgot near her to leave which they did not wanting to be hated by the popular girl on the bus. I just so happened to not be in the mood to deal with the shit sat in my usual spot oppisite to the exit. She then began to cry strongly though not sharing why with her friends so they continued to talk about gossip or their lives idk. Her best friend rhough wanted to take my spot tk be more near her so when I noticed she was cryong I did the nice thing and got up unfortunatley there werent any other spots on the bus because of huge amounts of people. I asked to sit next to the best friend she said frick off in harsher words. So I was forced to sit next to a crying girl on the emergancy exit of the bus. I asked, she accepted there I sat as she cried and I started to talk to get about what was going on in her life. She told me how her parents didnt accept her trying to experiment in her sexuality and her mom was mentally abusing her. I, aware of the steryotpes this was hitting was nice too her and asked her if all of this was true. SA said she didnt lie and I began to console her. For the rest of the year she didnt call me names or harass me in a bad light and she maybe saw me as a friend. I still dont know if it was right for me to  step in to help her or if I should've let her close friends help her. Or if I could've helped her better.","I tried to console a middle schooler through her sex orientation. The girl Im talking about in this post whoch we will call SA

I still dont know if it was right for me to  step in to help her or if I should've let her close friends help her. Or if I could've helped her better.",2,1.0,2019-06-25 5:32,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/c537c4/i_tried_to_console_a_middle_schooler_through_her/,Neutral
19710,9dn43b,post,I am having sex with my cousin,"Yeah, I know it's fucked up and all. But yeah I am having sex with my cousin. I'm 28 and she is 22. We have had sex twice. Was supposed to be 3 times yesterday but she was on her period.

I didn't know know this cousin existed until recently. Well exist ain't quite the word - but I had never met her in the flesh until June. Her mother (dad's younger sister) cut herself off from the rest of her family when she got married. To cut a long story short - I'm white South African. My aunt married a black South African guy - my cousin is biracial - and her family fiercely disapproved. A lot of shit went down (I was a baby at the time) and she ended up cutting off all her family and moving to Canada with her husband. This was all during apartheid so you can imagine the amount of shit my aunt and uncle took. They had to flee to Canada cause it was so bad.

My aunt and her family finally reconciled a few years back and this year they came back to SA to visit. My cousin and I hit it off. We just have good chemistry. One night the whole family was drinking. It went on until around 2am - by then everyone went to bed. We stayed up and talked and drank. And then we kissed and the rest is history. The second time we had sex we were sober. Yesterday didn't happen cause of the period. I can't get her out of my mind. I've never experienced sex this good. Perhaps the taboo factor enhances it but I am bloody intoxicated with her. She's a fucking Goddess.

I am also fearful. I mean we are treading on extremely dangerous ground. I can't even contemplate the notion of our family finding out. We would be fucked beyond comprehension. But then I can't stop thinking about her.

19711,7to1ja,post,"I've hit a new level of my masturbation addiction, and I'm ready to finally live my life","This is kinda long, but I just really need to get this all typed out for my own sake, I understand if you think this is boring as shit. It’s more just for me to start the new beginning of my life. 

I’ve been jacking off 3-7 times every day for the past 5 years now. Usually the minimum amount of time is 20 minutes, and the max has gone up to 9 hours straight of masturbating. Overall, I have probably spent 50% of my free time the past year to self indulging, and another 30% lost to being in a hazy state from all the dopamine.  It has completely fucked my life up in terms of dating. Fucked up as in I’ve never had anything remotely close to a girlfriend, which really is a combination of me having low confidence due to my body, and having low libido because, ya know, the jacking my dick raw for half the day.

I had crippling social anxiety in high school even though I was captain of the football team, part of the popular crowd, and was attractive. I literally can only think of maybe 3 real conversations I had with girls in HS because my SA was that bad. Partly because I wasn’t ripped in terms of my body, and party for other unrelated reasons that I’ve since gotten over. 

People just assumed I didn’t talk because I thought I was too cool for anyone and thought I was too attractive or something. 

I’m not trying to brag or anything at all, but multiple girls have told me if I worked out hard I’d be a 10/10. I have great hair, I’m tall, extremely broad shoulders, above average penis, attractive face, and really I have the ability when I diet and exercise right my body gets jacked looking pretty quickly. I’ve just always been about 40 pounds overweight, I’ve had the muscles underneath, they were just hidden. But being a 9/10 look wise doesn’t do much when your body is a 5. You can’t just get by on looks, you need a personality, which I didn’t have because I was quiet.

But, for the past 2 years my social skills have gone up tremendously, in college and high school my mind would go blank and I would literally have flashes of blindness anytime a girl talked to me. (unless I was drunk, which is where the majority of the handful of hookups have happened). But now I can talk with strangers just fine, sometimes it's worse than others, I wouldn’t say I’m James Bond or anything. 

The problem is my body is like complete dad bod, and my arms have significantly lost their buffness. I’ve worked out maybe 50 times the last 2 years and have eaten like complete shit. So I’m missing that flirty confidence. I’m stuck at being able to talk with girls about basic shit, but anything past that falls flat because I know they know, my body is just a flab-fest. I'mt not just talking about flirting thought, I'm talking about any kind of conversation that has depthness to it that puts myself out there. On top of this, I jack off so much for such long periods at a time, that I can’t get hard. The few times I’ve been in a position to have sex, I couldn't get hard enough to get it in. So this only furthers the damping “not sexy enough” feeling towards girls

And the reason I haven’t been able to exercise/eat right is because I jack off so god-damn much, I lose all motivation in my free time, to do anything but look on reddit for 15 minutes between my 2 hour long jack off sessions. There have been stretches where I go a week or 2 working out 4 times a week, usually eating on a meal plan. But soon I’m just replacing the productivity with masturbation again. 



I feel I’ve lost out so much in life, I have no summer love memories, no girls I can look back on that bring warm feelings, no first high school love, no going out on double dates with my friends, no cool party hooking up stories, no female friends in genearl at all,  and really overall just a lack of connection made with everyone, girls, friends, and family. All because I couldn’t control my urges and I let them turn from a dripping faucet in the sink, into the bathroom is now flooded and the floor gave out and the bathtub fell through the floor, hitting and destroying the safe that contained a bitcoin wallet worth millions. (Can’t tell if this analogy is awful or amazing)

So I’m just finally typing this out, after a literal full day of stroking my dick, to just get it all of my chest. I think doing so does some psychological thing to the brain that helps kick start the rebooting process. Science. 

Here’s to 6 months to a year from now, when I’ll be masturbating a normal amount, working out, getting fit, healthy, making more friends and memories, and just overall living a more fulfilling life.

19712,771wc4,post,"[conflicted][tough love]Ever since last year I feel physically revolted by the sight of East Asian men. I don't want to be hateful and hold this negative energy, how do I overcome it?","I'm Colombian.
Last year, Colombia hosted the Futsal world cup. I attended several matches of it with some of my crew.

A couple of them, involved the national futsal team of Vietnam, here depicted: https://www.google.com/search?q=vietnam+futsal&client=firefox-b-ab&dcr=0&tbm=isch&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwini6ex8fPWAhXJSCYKHWMrAocQ_AUIDCgD

One thing that happened there and then, unlike any other foreign team we had watched play to that point, was a profound sense of revulsion and hate for the Vietnamese players. It's not their playing style (unremarkable, but normal), or their results or how their position in the ladder affected our favourites, no. It was the physical features they displayed.

Compared to any other country that attended the tournament, whether from Europe, Africa, Central Asia or the Americas, the Vietnamese were by far the shortest, the scrawniest, and the ones that had this off-putting thing of doing small skips when running around, as if they were some limping pony. It didn't help that their facial expressions are so rare and most of the time they don't seem to experience joy, pain or anything like the rest of us. The flat angles in the face make it seem like they're statues or something.

Suffice is to say, it felt so effeminate that it pissed us off to the point we started rooting for their opposing team, and I went ahead with it too. However, after that was over with, I felt quite uneasy about myself since I don't want to hold such negative energy and blind hatred.

I had never had any opinions of Asian men since they're practically absent here, except for the one or two people you see every blue moon, but after seeing a more sizable collective of them, I can't shake the sensation of looking at Asian men as complete untermensch that weird me out and creep me out.

It's not a matter of rationalizing supremacy or xenophobia or so. After all I've lived and made friends with white people, black people and Middle Eastern people.

Further, I don't think it's the slanted eyes that's putting me off either. In the same Futsal tournament from last year, I went to a couple of matches where Kazakhstan played, and I could find myself feeling sympathy for them since they had more normal expressions and their bodies weren't so off-putting : https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-ab&dcr=0&tbm=isch&sa=1&q=kazakhstan+futsal&oq=kazakhstan+futsal

My predicament is thus the following: I'm aware not all East Asian men are inferior nor that on account of their race, however the average male from it has an appearance and demeanour that is offensive to watch, akin to have an LGBT pride parade pass right in front of your house.

In particularly bad moments, I end up developing the vengeful urge to get with Asian women not because I care in the least about them, but just to parade them around single Asian men and make them suffer.

I hate feeling like this, it eats away at me and makes me both lose focus as well as affect my capacity to have sound moral judgement. I've not told anyone in my life about it, and I play it off whenever asked about it, yet it's an internal hole that won't go away and has largely made me lose empathy with East Asians.

TL;DR: How can I overcome the visual disgust I feel when looking at East Asian men, that sometimes makes me want to steal East Asian women from them out of spite, and just be able to look at them and feel about them the same way I do about any other type of man?

19713,6gwp2w,post,Stay at Home dad cheating with multiple SaH neighborhood moms,"[Tough Love]    
My wife is a physician and makes enough money that we can be a single income family so I have been staying at home with our two kids for several years. In that time, I have cultivated affairs with three of the SaH moms who live in our neighborhood by forging relationships with them by volunteering at our kids elementary school, tennis and yoga lessons, and after school kids events. Most of these connections are just friendships, but over my time in the homemaker gig, I have ending up sleeping with 3 of the moms multiple times. All were pretty great in the sack, but one in particular was insanely hot and I about had a stroke with her a couple of times.    
My wife and I get along OK but are basically just roommates  these days with a dead bedroom situation, so I haven't felt too guilty about the sleeping around to this point. Also, even though I am in my mid-40's my libido is like that of a 21 year old again, I am not kidding.    
I know though that I am heading for disaster and if these women ever start comparing notes that I have slept with them all at one point or another, I could lose everything. Still, I haven't been able to stop myself yet. Man, the sex has been just spectacular, I am not kidding.","Stay at Home dad cheating with multiple SaH neighborhood moms [Tough Love]

19715,5kiu59,post,"I know things about my father that i cannot share, help with some advice please !!!","Hello to everyone, this is my first post on reddit but i had the need to share this. So lets start by saing i am 25 years old, male, and working at one of my fathers companies. 
Let's give some info for my family before i continue with my problem: 21 years ago my mother and father started a company for agricultural farmacy, it turned out succesfull and some years later they started doing agriculter it self, that started sucssefully too and a few years later they invested in the winemaking buisness (where i work). So taking all that in mind here is my secret: 
A few years back (like 2014) i found out, by my myself, that my father is cheating on my mother with a girl who is as old as me. After confronting him about it he said he was just gonna stop seeing her, unfortunatly that never happend, and he is still talking/seeing her. It turns out that my mother knows about that, and that hurts her alot, i can see it and it hurts me to see her angry and hurt all the time. After talking with my father again he said that they have dicidet not to split because of my little sister (she is 15 atm.) after some time he said he is stopping and for a little bit everything was OK. but unfortunatly it turned out he has not stopped. And i have no idea what to do, I really hate him for that .... i can't stand seeing my mother upset, hurt and agry all the time .... it is frustrating as hell. 
The second thing is: the last 2-3 years are tough in buisness and we are a bit struggaling, since he started cheating and the buisness started failing a bit he became the biggest assh*le i have seen, he is always yeling at everyone, he always sayes to me ""I don't what alot from you, i just want you to be perfect"" ,wich is something i cannot be unfortunatly. He is always in my back, always yelling at me for stuff i have done and mostly for his own mistakes wich i cannot correct, in 2015 they put me in this company and told me to figure a way to make it earn money again, and that was all, i am doing my best but the pressure he is putting on me is too damn much, half of the time i cannot concentrate and when i ask for some advice or something about how to run the company, acounting documents for some insitutions or something like that, i always get the same answer, ""I don't have time for you now, later we will talk"" (the later never comes) .... i love making wine this is my passion but working with him turned out to be the biggest mistake in my life. .....

19718,3jvv59,post,My Social Anxiety Has Returned,"[Remorse]

I am currently at a crossroads in my life. I moved away from my parent a while ago and I knew that I would have to eventually make the decision to live by myself after graduating college. I eventually did find a full-time job after about five months. Before then, I have made a few friends along the way in college, but due to my moving to find work, it has become more difficult. I thought that moving would give me a clean slate to meet new friends and potentially even have an SO. Unfortunately, I feel like I'm stuck and don't know where to go. 

I was bullied when I was younger and due to the break-up of my parents when I was young, I don't have a good grasp of how most types of friendships work. I have difficulty approaching others for any reason. I always have the uncomfortable fear of them not wanting to be around me or me thinking they are bad people. I almost fell into the trap of drug abusers when I was in high school due to my quirky personality and me being outcasted from others. Fortuntately, I was able to bail myself out before I ended up engaging in those types of behaviors.

When I started working, I took up Toastmasters to improve some aspects of my speaking. Unfortunately, a bad experience caused me to shell right back up again with my insecurities coming back with a vengeance. When I'm not working, I don't get out much at all and being in the Austin area with lots of young people, I feel that I shouldn't have that kind of excuse. I'm in my late 20's, so I know that there still is time for me to change, but with my return to SA, I'm not sure if it feels like I can change. 

I would like to share a bad experience of mine. I was teaching a lady how to play pinball when I was at a convention. She was by herself and we talked and had fun. We were both going to be back for the second day, but when i saw her again, I didn't make any mention of myself. I tensed up, didn't talk to her, and felt really terrible about it. Never saw her for the rest of the day. Not her fault. At first, I took it as being abandoned, but realized that I was more of the one at fault than anyone else.

I feel pretty awkward in social situations, which probably didn't help me when I was seeking work. I will admit that I am a shy person, but I think is has a lot to do with not being able to understand social cues in certain situations. One time, I was talking with someone and came off as really creepy and lost a friendship because the whole situation was taken the wrong way. I feel I need to find a place to start to get rid of my social anxiety and start becoming the better person I wanted to be when I first moved.

To note some other factors, I'm not particularly religious and I don't drink alcohol because it makes me sick.","My Social Anxiety Has Returned [Remorse]

19721,257bnw,post,"[Traditional] [Listen] I nearly had sex with my best friend's recent ex, and I am pretending it never happened. He doesn't know, and the guilt is killing me.","[Traditional] Bear with me, it's a long story. It's more for getting off my chest, but advice is welcome.

**tl;dr: I nearly had sex with my best friend's ex, she told me she's using him and the guy she cheated on him with for attention, and I can't bring myself to tell him about either thing.**

As a preface, I'm a university student who lives on-campus (same with him, but not roommates), and they broke up less than a month ago after over a year and a half together.

The reason this whole thing bugs me so much is not only because of my guilt, not only because he doesn't know, but also because of things she told me about him that he should also know...but I can't tell him one without the other.

So last Friday, I went to a party at a fraternity, since school had just ended and we get a week basically off before final exams for the semester. I went with people who live on the floor of my dorm, mostly just a few guys and a few girls I know, expecting to just enjoy a party with friends.

I got to the party, but as soon as I had the first bit of alcohol, I got this fiendish desire in me (unlike ever before, and I've had drinks at parties for quite some time now) to drink more. And by more, I mean a **lot** more. I wanted to let loose. Maybe it had something to do with **my** recent breakup, maybe it had something to do with the stress of the end of the year, maybe it was just random. Either way, I ended up taking a whole lot more to drink than was a good idea.

Then I ran into her there. I'd always found her attractive, but my friend had told me lately she was exhibiting some pretty self-destructive tendencies. They broke up because she cheated on him with someone he used to be friends with but despised even before she cheated with him. And that, I found, was the tip of the iceberg. At the party, she and her friend were *competing* to see how many guys they could make out with.

Even as drunk as I was, I knew it would be bad to get involved. Still, I am a very carnally motivated person when I drink, and I'd be lying if I said I wasn't secretly hoping she'd make out with me too. I kept my distance, though, and actually gave her tips on how to get guys to like her instead of her just being forward and saying ""Let's make out"".

Now you've probably got an idea of what she was like. And while I'm no saint, I've only slept with one girl in my life (a committed relationship that lasted over 6 months) and have never even made out with a random girl before. So for me to be considering making out with her was pretty bad, you could say.

At some point, she insists I come with her and her friends to dance. She effectively abandons one of the guys who was following her around like a puppy after she kissed him, and we get to the dance floor of the fraternity house. Next thing I know, she's grinding on me, and grinding very intensely. It was just a few minutes later at the most when she turns around and kisses me. And bam, I'm down the rabbit hole.

We end up leaving the party, and heading back to my dorm room. I'm not sobering up at all, and she seems pretty excited by what's happening since it was her suggestion to head back anyways, and we are on the way back when I remember my roommate is in the room and get a measure of sense: maybe I can get out of this, I figure.

Well, I underestimated how badly she had set herself on this idea.

As we're walking, though, she says a lot of really disgustingly rude things about my friend. Tells me how he was ""controlling"" her, he didn't care enough about her, etc. Now, I would ordinarily give anyone the benefit of the doubt, and say my friend might not have been the best, had I not spoken to him at length about this and seen text messages. He spent $80 to go to her birthday party and take a weekend off of schoolwork, only to find she invited the person she cheated on him with ""so he could bring alcohol"". When he asked why she didn't at least *warn* him, she said ""I didn't want you to not come"". And this, too, is the tip of the iceberg. She attempted to get him to cut his hair (which is about [this length](https://www.google.com/search?q=johnny+depp&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS525US525&tbm=isch&imgil=prDsqS2bbX8L_M%253A%253Bhttps%253A%252F%252Fencrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com%252Fimages%253Fq%253Dtbn%253AANd9GcTiU770R8r2wda6bl6iVdO7Buuvk8pbRVIkVXOU7EUoG55w7Ro4%253B1600%253B1000%253BpYzvdk5Z0wzWrM%253Bhttp%25253A%25252F%25252Fparade.condenast.com%25252F20730%25252Flinzlowe%25252Fjohnny-depp-turns-50-photos-of-the-actor-through-the-years%25252F&source=iu&usg=__979NY77NF7XJu72U-1F4MuNhz8U%3D&sa=X&ei=WhluU_CaMoyAogSB3YKgDQ&ved=0CLYBEP4dMA4#facrc=_&imgdii=_&imgrc=prDsqS2bbX8L_M%253A%3BpYzvdk5Z0wzWrM%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fparade.condenast.com%252Fwp-content%252Fuploads%252F2013%252F06%252Fjohnny-depp-12.jpg%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fparade.condenast.com%252F20730%252Flinzlowe%252Fjohnny-depp-turns-50-photos-of-the-actor-through-the-years%252F%3B1600%3B1000)) because her friends ""told [her] he looks like a methhead"". I couldn't believe it if I hadn't seen the text messages to prove it, but you get the idea. And he'd been nothing but nice about things, judging by his responses: I would've cut it off sooner. But that's not the point, the point is, she's slandering him. And then she drops the real big bomb, and mentions that they're still hooking up. And that she's hooking up with the guy she cheated with too. Why? Because ""they're easy to use"". Yeah, I can't even make this shit up. Her words were ""They both think I love them and I don't love either, but they pay for me for things and I can use them soooooo easily"". I'm disgusted, as you can imagine, but I'm also drunk, and my head doesn't really win out in that case. The disgust turns me off though, and I'm pretty set on at least *trying* to get out of this if I can.

We get back to my dorm, go to my floor, and I ""just remembered"" my roommate is asleep and I would ""feel sooooo bad"" waking him up. So she decides we should hang out in my floor's lounge (pretty big room, got a large sofa or two). I'm starting to get ahold of myself, and realize this is a bad idea. But I'm still pretty tempted, without a doubt. I decide to sit on the chair across from her as she lays on the big couch, and text her friends to come pick her up. They say they're on their way, but it'll be awhile.

Now, I wish I remember how this happened, but I don't. I have a black spot in my memory, and when my memory comes back I am on top of her, she's shirtless, we're making out, and my phone is ringing. Her friends are here. She throws on her clothes, I realize my belt is unbuckled, and I buckle it and get my shoes on. She leaves, and I haven't seen her since. The next morning she sent me a text saying ""We should party again ;)"", but I never answered. And I won't, either.

Thing is, I don't have the heart to tell my friend. I've spoken to him, and I can hardly look him in the face. He can tell something is up, but I had been telling him I felt poorly lately about my own breakup, and that I was dealing with a lot of home stress, so he probably thinks it's something about that. He hasn't even asked. I did drunkenly text him that we had to talk one night this past week, but I lost all my courage when he responded the next morning, and I told him ""Another time"". He hasn't pushed the subject.

I feel guilty. Not only do I feel no better than the person she cheated with (I know, I know, it's not the same, but still), but I feel like he needs to know this. I just don't know how to tell him. I feel selfish that I don't want to tell him so I don't lose one of my best friends (and one of the people who helped me most when I transferred up here and broke up with my girlfriend while I had almost no other friends here...), but I also don't know how to approach it, or whether he can handle something like this during finals week.

I know I might be making this worse in my head than it is, and it's affected me pretty badly as a result. I don't even sleep anymore, not more than 4 hours a night, because I've been having nightmares about this (among the many other things bothering me that aren't my fault that I'm working on/with).

It feels good to get off my chest...I'm glad I could at least say the whole story somewhere, and have it compiled so I can read it myself I guess :/.","[Traditional] [Listen] I nearly had sex with my best friend's recent ex, and I am pretending it never happened.

She attempted to get him to cut his hair (which is about [this length](https://www.google.com/search?q=johnny+depp&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS525US525&tbm=isch&imgil=prDsqS2bbX8L_M%253A%253Bhttps%253A%252F%252Fencrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com%252Fimages%253Fq%253Dtbn%253AANd9GcTiU770R8r2wda6bl6iVdO7Buuvk8pbRVIkVXOU7EUoG55w7Ro4%253B1600%253B1000%253BpYzvdk5Z0wzWrM%253Bhttp%25253A%25252F%25252Fparade.condenast.com%25252F20730%25252Flinzlowe%25252Fjohnny-depp-turns-50-photos-of-the-actor-through-the-years%25252F&source=iu&usg=__979NY77NF7XJu72U-1F4MuNhz8U%3D&sa=X&ei=WhluU_CaMoyAogSB3YKgDQ&ved=0CLYBEP4dMA4#facrc=_&imgdii=_&imgrc=prDsqS2bbX8L_M%253A%3BpYzvdk5Z0wzWrM%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fparade.condenast.com%252Fwp-content%252Fuploads%252F2013%252F06%252Fjohnny-depp-12.jpg%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fparade.condenast.com%252F20730%252Flinzlowe%252Fjohnny-depp-turns-50-photos-of-the-actor-through-the-years%252F%3B1600%3B1000)) because her friends ""told [her] he looks like a methhead"". I couldn't believe it if I hadn't seen the text messages to prove it, but you get the idea. And he'd been nothing but nice about things, judging by his responses: I would've cut it off sooner. But that's not the point, the point is, she's slandering him. And then she drops the real big bomb, and mentions that they're still hooking up. And that she's hooking up with the guy she cheated with too. Why? Because ""they're easy to use"". Yeah, I can't even make this shit up. Her words were ""They both think I love them and I don't love either, but they pay for me for things and I can use them soooooo easily"". I'm disgusted, as you can imagine, but I'm also drunk, and my head doesn't really win out in that case. The disgust turns me off though, and I'm pretty set on at least *trying* to get out of this if I can.

We get back to my dorm, go to my floor, and I ""just remembered"" my roommate is asleep and I would ""feel sooooo bad"" waking him up. So she decides we should hang out in my floor's lounge (pretty big room, got a large sofa or two). I'm starting to get ahold of myself, and realize this is a bad idea. But I'm still pretty tempted, without a doubt. I decide to sit on the chair across from her as she lays on the big couch, and text her friends to come pick her up. They say they're on their way, but it'll be awhile.

Now, I wish I remember how this happened, but I don't. I have a black spot in my memory, and when my memory comes back I am on top of her, she's shirtless, we're making out, and my phone is ringing. Her friends are here. She throws on her clothes, I realize my belt is unbuckled, and I buckle it and get my shoes on. She leaves, and I haven't seen her since. The next morning she sent me a text saying ""We should party again ;)"", but I never answered. And I won't, either.

Thing is, I don't have the heart to tell my friend. I've spoken to him, and I can hardly look him in the face. He can tell something is up, but I had been telling him I felt poorly lately about my own breakup, and that I was dealing with a lot of home stress, so he probably thinks it's something about that. He hasn't even asked. I did drunkenly text him that we had to talk one night this past week, but I lost all my courage when he responded the next morning, and I told him ""Another time"". He hasn't pushed the subject.

I feel guilty. Not only do I feel no better than the person she cheated with (I know, I know, it's not the same, but still), but I feel like he needs to know this. I just don't know how to tell him. I feel selfish that I don't want to tell him so I don't lose one of my best friends (and one of the people who helped me most when I transferred up here and broke up with my girlfriend while I had almost no other friends here...), but I also don't know how to approach it, or whether he can handle something like this during finals week.

I know I might be making this worse in my head than it is, and it's affected me pretty badly as a result. I don't even sleep anymore, not more than 4 hours a night, because I've been having nightmares about this (among the many other things bothering me that aren't my fault that I'm working on/with).

It feels good to get off my chest...I'm glad I could at least say the whole story somewhere, and have it compiled so I can read it myself I guess :/.",7,6.0,2014-05-10 12:29,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/257bnw/traditional_listen_i_nearly_had_sex_with_my_best/,Neutral

19724,198v8b,post,"I've secretly been an opioid addict for years, part 1","Preface: I apologize if this post comes across as excessively self-indulgent (and lengthy). Believe it or not, there is an equally long part 2! I hoped that by writing the complete story of my addiction, I could achieve catharsis and come to terms with what has become of my life.

Background: I believe that addictions are deeply rooted in other issues, and thus some background information seems appropriate. Ever since I was a child, I can recall being affected by significant mental health issues, including depression, anxiety (GAD/Sa[n]D) and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Additionally, many of my peers have speculated that I have Asperger's syndrome, though I have not been diagnosed with it (several doctors have even stated specifically that I do not suffer from this condition). Psychological problems run in the family, especially depression and anxiety. After middle school, these problems became increasingly significant. Though I did very well in school and graduated as valedictorian, I could sense that my life was spinning out of control.

The summer before my senior year of high school, I developed a profound interest in psychotropic substances. I had few friends and little to do, so I spent the entire summer researching compounds and their effects. In the beginning I was scrupulous when choosing the substances I would actually take, and I never took anything in a reckless or ignorant manner. I experimented with and documented the effects of nitrous oxide, dextromethorphan, morning glory seeds, Hawaiian baby woodrose seeds, kava kava, alprazolam, lorazepam, propoxyphene, hydrocodone, kratom, amphetamine and Psilocybe cubensis mushrooms, respectively.(I request that you please do not comment on the safety of these substances; this list is not intended to serve as an acknowledgement of which substances I consider safe, and therefore the doses have been omitted). Generally, I was able to control my drug usage very well. However, I eventually got reckless with the mushrooms.

I told myself that I was taking all of these drugs in a quasi-scientific manner, as it is difficult if not impossible to truly understand descriptions of drug effects without first-hand experience, especially in the case of psychedelics. I felt I needed to experience the “ultimate” psychedelic state, and I obstinately pursued this goal, even when negative psychological reactions began to manifest. I increased the dosage from 0.5g to 3.5g to 7.2g (of rigorously dried mushrooms) over the course of six months and fifteen trips.

Needless to say, the higher dose trips (the two highest being 6.5g and 7.2g) were very difficult to manage. I had some incomprehensibly troubling experiences, which I had trouble integrating. Though the lower-dose trips were apparently beneficial, these trips seemed to exacerbate my already unstable psychological state. I became cognizant the tenuity all knowledge, and the lack of an objective reality. The awareness of my own assumptions, biases and preconceptions was valuable in some respects, but the uncertainty of everything made me uneasy and neurotic. I stopped using drugs and spent the rest of high school and the first two years of college trying to reassemble the pieces of my shattered ego.

The summer prior to my freshman year of college, I began dating a girl from high school. This was my first serious, intimate relationship. Furthermore, our personalities were antipodal, resulting in frequent conflict. She was domineering, egotistical, and materialistic, whereas I was submissive, self-effacing, and intellectual. While I typically was tractable to her demands, I resented her attempts at control, especially her use of sex and intimacy as implements of manipulation. If I did something to displease her, sexual satisfaction was withheld. My friends admonished me for continuing our relationship, but I foolishly believed that I could change her and finally achieve happiness. The one thing I always sought was a loving relationship, and this imperfect one seemed to be the best substitute I could obtain. Despite all of the lows, the intermittent positive experiences kept me hooked. Long before I was addicted to any drug (I had no problems ceasing mushroom use once I finally attained a peak experience), I was caught up in an addictive relationship.

Now the stage was set for my decent into addiction. For those readers keeping track, I now had to contend with innate mental health issues, psychedelic-induced psychological instability, and an frequently unhappy relationship. The ‘last straw’ came during the second week of May 2010, after I had completed my sophomore year as a chemistry student. The relationship between my girlfriend and me had been deteriorating for two months, to the point where we had not seen each other in over five weeks, despite my attempts at reconciliation. I finally got her to agree to a Skype call, during which she told me she had been sleeping with an older fraternity guy for a month. I was understandably devastated. I had spent two years fostering our relationship, forgoing friends at my school to drive to see her. Instead of attempting to begin a new relationship at my college (the logical alternative), I had spent every weekend with her.

Thus my frequent suicidal ideation became constant suicidal ideation. Being a student of chemistry and pharmacology, the ideal method seemed to be massive opioid overdose. I do not know how seriously I contemplated this action, but after two weeks of misery, I decided something needed to be done. I had already tried numerous antidepressants over the previous four years, none of which affected any significant relief from my mental torment. I thought day and night about a potential solution; I seemed to be stuck in an eternal cycle of depression and anger. These thought patterns were reminiscent of the looping thoughts experienced during psychedelic trips. I was trapped on the ‘hedonism treadmill’, but seemingly powerless to change anything. After recalling the positive results of my previous opioid experiences, I decided to try taking them once more. I carefully considered this decision, agonizing over every possible outcome. I determined: 1. I did not care if I died of an overdose, 2. If I became addicted I would simply try ibogaine therapy and commit suicide if it failed, and 3. Any other outcome could only have desirable ramifications. And so I made the fateful choice to locate and purchase the narcotic known as oxycodone.

Addiction, The Rise: During the time I have described to you (May 2010), I was consistently feeling the worst I had ever felt in my entire life until that point, with the exception of the temporally-limited experience of bad trips. I would like to emphasize that, knowing all I did about psychoactive substances, the choice to consistently abuse opioids was certainly not an easy one (past opioid experiences were few and spaced far apart). However, by comparison to imminent suicide, the alternative of self-medication seemed attractive. On the basis of the “ask and you shall receive” principle, I approached my morally questionable neighbor and inquired about oxycodone. Coincidentally, he had a solid connection, and thus was able to buy me however many I wanted…for the right price, of course (which turned out to be $1/mg). I started off by purchasing 3 80mg Oxycontin tablets. Despite my suicidal thoughts, I actually did not want to overdose, and so I started with a reasonable dose of approximately 20mg (a quarter of the tablet). I divided the tablet, crushed it, and insufflated the resulting fine powder. Initially, I was decidedly underwhelmed. I was expected a life-changing euphoria, but instead I felt only a pleasant warmth. This feeling was still better than what I had been experiencing, and thus I continued to abuse oxycodone.

After a few more attempts, I attained the bliss I had been seeking. I was enveloped in the most beautiful warm glow, feeling as though I was practically radiating light and empathy. All of the worries that had once besieged me simply evaporated, leaving only pure, unadulterated euphoria. I slipped into a state of diminished awareness, where my mind was filled with colorful visions of a whimsical and fantastical nature. I could scarcely move; my body was heavy, perhaps as after an exhausting run or powerful orgasm. I noticed that my breathing had become slowed and intermittent, though this realization did not trouble me. I felt free to socialize, unafraid of embarrassment or rejection. This uninhibited socialization was utterly foreign to me; even under the influence of alcohol, I remained painfully self-conscious. Oxycodone allowed me to openly express myself while remaining almost perfectly lucid (in reasonable doses), providing a major incentive to continue my abuse.

At the time, it appeared that I had discovered the secret to happiness. For $40 a day, I could enjoy a pleasure greater than sex and socialize “like everyone else”. I calculated how long I could sustain this joyride, based on the cost per day and the money in my savings account (which was significant, as I rarely went out to do things). Of course, there was one factor I failed to account for sufficiently: the inevitable tolerance which developed with prolonged use. I had anticipated a constant, gradual increase, but the reality was harshly different. Within three weeks, using four times per week, my preferred doses had doubled. Nevertheless, at this stage, I was still able to maintain intense euphoria simply by increasing the dose, a luxury which was also lost over time.

As anyone familiar with nascent addictions knows, this state of affairs was hopelessly unsustainable. Eventually, my usage would increase to a point that would be too costly to support. I would then either quit or find a novel way to support my habit. One month from my first dose, however, this time was still a long ways off. With my newfound confidence, I was able to begin dating a girl from one of my chemistry classes. She seemed primarily concerned with physical intimacy, which was fine by me. I was especially pleased to discover that she was strongly submissive, exactly the opposite of my previous girlfriend. With my drug-fueled confidence (and anorgasmia!), I finally got a taste of a satisfying sexual relationship. In just one month, oxycodone had completely revolutionized my life. I went from feeling like a depressive, suicidal loser to a sexy, outgoing stud.

Everything wasn’t perfect, obviously. While the afterglow was still significant, leaving me content even the day after using, I noticed that a significant depression returned after two days without opioids. There was also the hassle of meeting my contact and paying for the substance. Nonetheless, these all seemed like minor inconveniences considering the benefits I had realized from regular opioid dosing. Besides, there was a simple solution to the creeping depression: more frequent dosing. I began dosing every other day, then every day, then multiple times each day. I wasn’t too concerned because the semblance of withdrawal was manageable, and I continued to have a significant cash reserve.

More seriously, I moderately overdosed on one occasion. While I did not pass out, I became incredibly dizzy, nauseous (I usually had no issues with nausea, even at high doses), and confused. Unlike my first dangerously high dose, I had no colorful visions and no euphoria. I felt like I was constantly about to faint, even standing up, and it took all of my willpower to retain consciousness. I would not feel the need to breathe for a minute, and then suddenly gasp for air. Obviously, this incident was rather disturbing.

Nevertheless, the good times continued to roll: I had an amazing 4th of July and loved going to the beach and basking in the sun while my body was blissfully warm and numb. At home, I no longer felt imprisoned, but was content to relax and listen to music (particularly hard rock, such as Led Zeppelin) or play video games (appropriately enough, Oblivion). One of my more embarrassing yet sensually gratifying activities after large doses was lying on a velvet blanket while dragging it across my bare skin. I no longer craved intimacy with anyone else; I could achieve more pleasure non-sexually by myself.

Unfortunately, the “honeymoon phase” was finite. I began to become concerned after I went on vacation for four days with my family. I decided to test myself by not bringing any drugs on the trip, just to ensure that I could still be happy without them. By the end of the first day, I noticed the onset of a psychological withdrawal syndrome. I was constantly thinking about how I could obtain some opioids. “Perhaps there was a bar I could go to where someone was selling them, or maybe I could find some on the beach and identify them online or maybe…” My thoughts of the high were ceaseless. Though I was certainly disturbed by these manifestations of my developing addiction, I purchased more oxycodone the first day I got home.

Three weeks later, reality was quickly setting in, and I had only a couple weeks of summer vacation remaining. I resolved to immediately stop all drug use, and so I did. There was no physical withdrawal, just the same psychological symptoms mentioned previously. Once I got back to college, it became clear that staying sober would be a daunting task. I had to complete large amounts of work, as well as confront my paucity of friends. The mental health issues I suffered with before beginning opioid use resurfaced, though my summertime glimpse of “normalcy” had dampened them somewhat. Because the “withdrawal” was not terribly difficult, I foolishly decided to resume my oxycodone habit once more. This mistake cost me dearly, as that previous 'kick' was to be the last time I could quit without physical withdrawal symptoms...

Instead of attempting to begin a new relationship at my college (the logical alternative), I had spent every weekend with her.

Thus my frequent suicidal ideation became constant suicidal ideation. Being a student of chemistry and pharmacology, the ideal method seemed to be massive opioid overdose. I do not know how seriously I contemplated this action, but after two weeks of misery, I decided something needed to be done. I had already tried numerous antidepressants over the previous four years, none of which affected any significant relief from my mental torment. I thought day and night about a potential solution; I seemed to be stuck in an eternal cycle of depression and anger. These thought patterns were reminiscent of the looping thoughts experienced during psychedelic trips. I was trapped on the ‘hedonism treadmill’, but seemingly powerless to change anything. After recalling the positive results of my previous opioid experiences, I decided to try taking them once more. I carefully considered this decision, agonizing over every possible outcome. I determined: 1. I did not care if I died of an overdose, 2. If I became addicted I would simply try ibogaine therapy and commit suicide if it failed, and 3. Any other outcome could only have desirable ramifications. And so I made the fateful choice to locate and purchase the narcotic known as oxycodone.

Addiction, The Rise: During the time I have described to you (May 2010), I was consistently feeling the worst I had ever felt in my entire life until that point, with the exception of the temporally-limited experience of bad trips. I would like to emphasize that, knowing all I did about psychoactive substances, the choice to consistently abuse opioids was certainly not an easy one (past opioid experiences were few and spaced far apart). However, by comparison to imminent suicide, the alternative of self-medication seemed attractive. On the basis of the “ask and you shall receive” principle, I approached my morally questionable neighbor and inquired about oxycodone. Coincidentally, he had a solid connection, and thus was able to buy me however many I wanted…for the right price, of course (which turned out to be $1/mg). I started off by purchasing 3 80mg Oxycontin tablets. Despite my suicidal thoughts, I actually did not want to overdose, and so I started with a reasonable dose of approximately 20mg (a quarter of the tablet). I divided the tablet, crushed it, and insufflated the resulting fine powder. Initially, I was decidedly underwhelmed. I was expected a life-changing euphoria, but instead I felt only a pleasant warmth. This feeling was still better than what I had been experiencing, and thus I continued to abuse oxycodone.

After a few more attempts, I attained the bliss I had been seeking. I was enveloped in the most beautiful warm glow, feeling as though I was practically radiating light and empathy. All of the worries that had once besieged me simply evaporated, leaving only pure, unadulterated euphoria. I slipped into a state of diminished awareness, where my mind was filled with colorful visions of a whimsical and fantastical nature. I could scarcely move; my body was heavy, perhaps as after an exhausting run or powerful orgasm. I noticed that my breathing had become slowed and intermittent, though this realization did not trouble me. I felt free to socialize, unafraid of embarrassment or rejection. This uninhibited socialization was utterly foreign to me; even under the influence of alcohol, I remained painfully self-conscious. Oxycodone allowed me to openly express myself while remaining almost perfectly lucid (in reasonable doses), providing a major incentive to continue my abuse.

At the time, it appeared that I had discovered the secret to happiness. For $40 a day, I could enjoy a pleasure greater than sex and socialize “like everyone else”. I calculated how long I could sustain this joyride, based on the cost per day and the money in my savings account (which was significant, as I rarely went out to do things). Of course, there was one factor I failed to account for sufficiently: the inevitable tolerance which developed with prolonged use. I had anticipated a constant, gradual increase, but the reality was harshly different. Within three weeks, using four times per week, my preferred doses had doubled. Nevertheless, at this stage, I was still able to maintain intense euphoria simply by increasing the dose, a luxury which was also lost over time.

As anyone familiar with nascent addictions knows, this state of affairs was hopelessly unsustainable. Eventually, my usage would increase to a point that would be too costly to support. I would then either quit or find a novel way to support my habit. One month from my first dose, however, this time was still a long ways off. With my newfound confidence, I was able to begin dating a girl from one of my chemistry classes. She seemed primarily concerned with physical intimacy, which was fine by me. I was especially pleased to discover that she was strongly submissive, exactly the opposite of my previous girlfriend. With my drug-fueled confidence (and anorgasmia!), I finally got a taste of a satisfying sexual relationship. In just one month, oxycodone had completely revolutionized my life. I went from feeling like a depressive, suicidal loser to a sexy, outgoing stud.

Everything wasn’t perfect, obviously. While the afterglow was still significant, leaving me content even the day after using, I noticed that a significant depression returned after two days without opioids. There was also the hassle of meeting my contact and paying for the substance. Nonetheless, these all seemed like minor inconveniences considering the benefits I had realized from regular opioid dosing. Besides, there was a simple solution to the creeping depression: more frequent dosing. I began dosing every other day, then every day, then multiple times each day. I wasn’t too concerned because the semblance of withdrawal was manageable, and I continued to have a significant cash reserve.

More seriously, I moderately overdosed on one occasion. While I did not pass out, I became incredibly dizzy, nauseous (I usually had no issues with nausea, even at high doses), and confused. Unlike my first dangerously high dose, I had no colorful visions and no euphoria. I felt like I was constantly about to faint, even standing up, and it took all of my willpower to retain consciousness. I would not feel the need to breathe for a minute, and then suddenly gasp for air. Obviously, this incident was rather disturbing.

Nevertheless, the good times continued to roll: I had an amazing 4th of July and loved going to the beach and basking in the sun while my body was blissfully warm and numb. At home, I no longer felt imprisoned, but was content to relax and listen to music (particularly hard rock, such as Led Zeppelin) or play video games (appropriately enough, Oblivion). One of my more embarrassing yet sensually gratifying activities after large doses was lying on a velvet blanket while dragging it across my bare skin. I no longer craved intimacy with anyone else; I could achieve more pleasure non-sexually by myself.

Unfortunately, the “honeymoon phase” was finite. I began to become concerned after I went on vacation for four days with my family. I decided to test myself by not bringing any drugs on the trip, just to ensure that I could still be happy without them. By the end of the first day, I noticed the onset of a psychological withdrawal syndrome. I was constantly thinking about how I could obtain some opioids. “Perhaps there was a bar I could go to where someone was selling them, or maybe I could find some on the beach and identify them online or maybe…” My thoughts of the high were ceaseless. Though I was certainly disturbed by these manifestations of my developing addiction, I purchased more oxycodone the first day I got home.

Three weeks later, reality was quickly setting in, and I had only a couple weeks of summer vacation remaining. I resolved to immediately stop all drug use, and so I did. There was no physical withdrawal, just the same psychological symptoms mentioned previously. Once I got back to college, it became clear that staying sober would be a daunting task. I had to complete large amounts of work, as well as confront my paucity of friends. The mental health issues I suffered with before beginning opioid use resurfaced, though my summertime glimpse of “normalcy” had dampened them somewhat. Because the “withdrawal” was not terribly difficult, I foolishly decided to resume my oxycodone habit once more. This mistake cost me dearly, as that previous 'kick' was to be the last time I could quit without physical withdrawal symptoms...

19726,1i3zrm1,post,"I Said No, and He Did It Anyway—I’m Struggling to Process","Hey everyone,

I need to get this off my chest because I’ve been replaying it in my head, and I don’t know how to feel. I went on a date recently with someone I thought was sweet and kind, but it ended up being one of the most confusing and upsetting experiences of my life.

We met up, and he picked me up in his car. It already felt a little isolating since it was just us, but I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt. Almost immediately, he started grabbing my hand. I let go because I felt nervous, but he kept grabbing it again and again. When I didn’t hold his hand, he asked, “Why won’t you hold my hand?” like it was my fault for not wanting to.

Later, while we were parked, he leaned in to kiss me. I shook my head, said “no,” and pulled away, but he grabbed my head and said, “It’s okay, it’s okay,” and kissed me anyway. It wasn’t a soft or mutual kiss—it was rough. He pressed his lips hard into mine, told me to “open your mouth,” and forced his tongue into my mouth. I didn’t want to, but I did it because I felt like I had no choice. I wanted him to like me, and in that moment, I felt powerless to say no again.

He didn’t stop there. He kissed my neck without asking, kept his hand on my thigh, and then started sliding his hand up my dress. My legs were crossed, but his hand still went between my thighs—he was only a few inches from touching me somewhere even more intimate. He also grabbed and squeezed my thigh and touched my side close to my chest. It felt so invasive, but I froze because I didn’t know how to stop it.

What made it even worse were the things he said. He told me, “You’re so pretty, you make it hard for me to control myself,” as if it was my fault he couldn’t respect my boundaries. He said, “I’m a man, and you’re very attractive,” like that excused his behavior.

After the date, I texted him that I missed him because I was trying so hard to convince myself that this was normal. His response? “I’m still really horny.” That broke me. It made me realize how little he cared about me as a person.

The next day, I tried to set boundaries. I told him I wanted to slow things down because I wasn’t comfortable with how fast everything moved. His response? “I just don’t think I’ll be able to control myself enough for you to be comfortable.” Then he told me we were on “different paths” and ended things.

Now, I keep hearing myself say “no” and him saying “It’s okay, it’s okay” over and over again. I feel so confused and violated. I didn’t want any of this, but I also feel like I let it happen because I froze and wanted him to like me. I keep wondering if this is normal or if I’m overreacting because it wasn’t rape.

Am I wrong for feeling this way?

TL;DR:

I went on a date where the guy ignored my boundaries and made me feel violated. I said “no” when he tried to kiss me, but he grabbed my head, said “It’s okay,” and kissed me anyway. His kisses were rough, and he kept telling me to “open my mouth” so he could force tongue kisses. He also kissed my neck, slid his hand up my dress, and touched my thigh and side without consent. He made comments like, “You’re so pretty, you make it hard for me to control myself,” which felt manipulative.

19727,1hype1b,post,Being a teen parent is not something to be proud of,"
I'm 15, and I've seen alot of teen parents, like a fucking lot that it's a very common thing to see a pregnant girl walking around in school uniform or a boy having to take a kid to school while he is on his way to school as well.

What happened to using protection or having common knowledge about sex?

Being pregnant can be bad where I stay because the school's here don't except pregnant girls, if you are pregnant and they find out. They will kick you out cause you are a bad example for the other girls and to them "" mother's can't be in high  school "".

It's sounds bad, but it's not. You are wasting your youth if you decided to have sex with no protection. Also there are condoms for females as well.

Some teen munster makes it, but others suffer and are too irresponsible to take care of another living being. Baby food, clothes and diapers are expensive, imagine being a minor having to look for a job which doesn't even pay well enough feed your kids or have your parents who already have their own stress, to look after your child.

Being a parent is a blessing but rather be one when you are more mature, have a stable relationship, more financial and you know you are ready. 

Edit- I am South African, there is no ban of abortion here. I am speaking of my own town in my country with my schools that do not allow teen mums to be in schools, as I said they will be looked as a bad example to the other girls. Which the schools in this town say. I have to edited this here cause it seems like no one is actually reading this post but focusing on the teen pregnancy part. Also I'm talking about boys and girls who are teen parents if you actually read it. Also I'm talking about teens who have unprotected sex by their own will, I did mention rape or anything like that, if you are victim that's you. Don't comment on this cause you don't seem to be reading anything correctly here, sorry what happened to you but this isn't about rape.

19728,1hymiis,post,I made the difficult decision to cut ties with my mother,"This is a very long story so be prepared. My English is not perfect either because it's not my first language so sorry in advance.

I have always had a complicated relationship with my mother and this is due to her behavior. I feel like I have been used by my mother all my life.
My mother has always been a mythomaniac (the real disease) but never admitted it and never wanted to be treated.

Let's try to start from the beginning.

When she was pregnant with me, it turned out that she had deliberately stopped taking contraception while my father did not want children at that time. But even if the news was not at the right time, he dealt with it and accepted.
My mother has always desperately sought attention.
1st example: she once went to an appointment with the midwife to have an umbilical fluid puncture; she came back with bruises and scratches on her stomach and explained that they had blindly pricked her. TOTALLY FALSE. These injuries were makeup and she never went to that medical appointment.
2nd example: when she was pregnant, everyone asked her about the baby's health and eventually she felt that she was not receiving any attention towards her but that everything was for the baby. She scratched her belly in front of my grandmother to show her anger and said that she would ""give anything to get that thing out of her belly"". So I was just a thing; a thing to use to give her attention.

When I was born, she didn't take care of me; it was my father, my grandmother and my grandfather who did practically everything.
My parents separated shortly after I was one year old because my mother wanted to go elsewhere. When it came to custody, she simply refused to have it, she gave everything to my father.
She took me whenever she wanted and when I was with her, she didn't take care of me; worse, she mistreated me. She rarely washed me, didn't always feed me well and tied me to my crib with colson (the plastic rods used for DIY). Following this, youth services got involved and she was deprived of any right to look after me (she is my biological mother but cannot sign any papers and is not considered as a guardian).

All my childhood, I was tossed around all over Belgium, I was taken to all his conquests who were often not good people, I slept in garages, under bus shelters, in disused houses etc...
You will say to yourself, how could my father accept that? Well because he did not know. I was a very quiet child, I did not speak much and my mother threatened me so that I would not tell my father or my grandparents about all this. My mother has always been very very intelligent.

Around the age of 11, I began to understand that something was really wrong with my mother. When I understood who she was, I stopped talking to her.
I agreed to get back in touch with her when I was 13; when I saw that she had a roof over her head and that she was with someone decent.
However, the year I was 13 and 14, I suffered extremely traumatic events (sexual abuse from adults, bullying at school, etc.) so much so that I had to spend time in a psychiatric center to treat my depression. It was obvious that the professionals understood that there were problems with my mother and therefore called her in for family therapy. She always refused because ""psychiatrists are for crazy people"".

Despite this, I decided to give my mother a chance and in the end it went rather ""well"". Well, if we ignore the fake fainting fits she had pretending to be a witch and that ghosts wanted to speak through her.
But at 16, everything fell apart. She caught a very aggressive cancer which unfortunately meant that she had to have her womb (uterus, ovaries, etc.) and also her bladder amputated (so she has a bag for her urine). Everything happened one after the other: Crohn's disease, endometriosis, multiple sclerosis, kidney problems, tachycardia, etc.

During this whole period I took great care of her because I was afraid for her life (rightly so) but she was simply odious. It was okay with me because in the meantime I had developed a strong character and I no longer let myself be pushed around like when I was a child; but she was always picking on my brother-in-law. She called him fat, a pig, constantly compared him to me (in a bad way), even told him that if she had heart attacks it was his fault, etc. I often argued with her because of how she treated him.
I developed a very good relationship with his partner at the time who is a golden person, and since I knew that my mother was never going to make him and her son happy, I clearly told him that if he decided to leave my mother, I would fully support his decision. He ended up leaving my mother.
Of course I was happy that my stepfather and my stepbrother were free from my mother but I knew that on my mother's side it was going to be a disaster.

My mother never worked in her life, she never had much money, she always took advantage of men, their money and social benefits. So after her separation from my stepfather, she had nothing left. She found herself disabled and penniless. Fortunately, my stepfather let her have his house for almost a year without asking her for rent (just that she pay the bills) so that she could find decent housing, in accordance with her physical condition and within her budget.

When she moved out on her own, I started to become independent : I started university and I started working. Every month she asked me for money for X things; money that she said she would pay me back even though I knew that this was not going to be the case since she had no money.

I had a pretty busy schedule with work and studies and unfortunately she lived almost 2 hours from my house. So I didn't know how to go see her often, and honestly I didn't even want to anymore.
Every time I went, I had stomach ache and I came home crying or on the verge of a nervous breakdown. My partner started to make me understand that it was time for me to put an end to all this; that he was tired of seeing me unhappy because of her.

She committed acts for which I could have filed a complaint against her even if I did not do so.
She took advantage of the COV** period when we could no longer physically present ourselves at the administration offices to steal my identity and apply for additional social benefits in my name. As luck would have it, I was informed of the situation early enough and was able to stop the process without incriminating her. She did not receive a penny, and that is why I decided not to take legal action.
She has no money, she really struggles to make ends meet and I knew that if I started legal proceedings against her, she would lose everything even though she is disabled. I also know that she stole money from several people and never paid them back.
This is an example of her dishonesty because she never admitted that it was her even though all the evidence pointed to it; she never took responsibility.

When I talk about the fact that she is a mythomaniac I can give as an example the day she explained to me the sexual abuse she received from her father. Her father did indeed abuse her but my mother described to me that he took her fishing where he raped her with condoms filled with maggots. This is obviously false...even if she suffered abuse that was proven (he went to jail), she always had a tendency to add false details and to have hallucinations. There have been so many lies coming from her.
The problem of a person with a mythomaniac is their mania for telling stories that are lies in the eyes of people but that are real for them in their head.
In this situation, people close to them can no longer have any trust in the person, everything is questioned all the time, we doubt everything.

My mother always makes sure that things revolve around her even when it doesn't concern her and even if it can hurt those around her.
For example, one day, we went to have a board game night at some family friends' house. The couple had just had a baby and in the middle of the evening, my mother started crying because ""it hurt her to see a baby when she will never be able to have one again"". It's a pain that I understand because she has always wanted to have a second child...but I think we have to put it into perspective, that she has to be happy for her friends who are not responsible for her medical condition. But I know that she only did that because we weren't really paying attention to her that evening (she wasn't playing with us because she didn't want to, she was just watching). It really ruined the atmosphere.

Another example, more personal, is the day I was told that I had endometriosis like her. Even though it wasn't a big surprise to me, it's still not easy to hear knowing what it can cause. But strangely enough when I heard the news, what worried me first wasn't the fact that I might not be able to have a child but rather how my mother would react. As I expected, my mother burst into tears on the phone with my stepfather behind her, claiming that ""she knew it, that it was her fault (because it's a possibly hereditary disease) blah blah blah"". Ironic to have to console your mother when I was the one who should be consoled at that moment, right? She once again brought everything back to her.
She also repeatedly minimized the menstrual pains that I had by telling me that I had to stop whining because she has more pain than me (which is obvious, I don't question that). No support. She made me feel guilty all the time.

But on the other hand, to everyone, on social media, ... She always pretends to be a model, loving mother who knows her daughter perfectly. It's very frustrating and annoying to see that. I'm being used again to get her attention.

Since I became an adult, all my relatives have told me to be careful with my mother, that if I continued to let her do it, I would lose feathers. I did indeed lose a few, but I always told myself that I suffered less than her and that I had to take it upon myself.
However, I want to say that my father and my grandmother, those who raised me, never turned my brain against my mother. They always made sure that I saw things for myself, that I made my own choices.
My partner, who I have been with for a little over 3 years, has always hated my mother but made sure to be polite and cordial. He couldn't stand seeing me leave my mother's with a knot in my stomach and seeing me come home in tears or on the verge of a nervous breakdown. He clearly told me that I had to cut ties with my mother for my own good.

It's horrible to say but since my mother has very very bad health, I thought she would die earlier and that day, I would have been sad of course but that it would also have been a liberation for me.

But one day I had a click.

I had just lost my job that I loved so much, so I knew that I had to be careful about my spending while I found another job. One Saturday, my mother asked me for €100 because she had nothing left to eat at home; I sent it to her willingly even though I knew that she was not going to pay me back as she promised me every time. The following Tuesday (so 3 days later), she asked me for €500 to pay her bills. I explained to her that it was not possible because I had just lost a job that I loved and that I was going to have financial difficulties in the coming months. She was clearly complaining, telling me that her situation was worse than mine and that I had to show compassion. I cut the discussion short because I was quite upset. 2 weeks later, I heard from her where she told me that ""it was my fault, because I didn't send her any money, she couldn't afford her medication and that she lost 4 kilos because she could only afford pasta with tomato paste and instant noodles"".
It totally revolted me, how dare she make me feel guilty and make me look like such a hateful person? I cut the discussion short again.

A few days later I blocked her everywhere (except by email). She tried to contact several of my relatives whom I had informed of my decision to cut ties with her.
She contacted my grandmother who explained to her that if I had made this decision it was because I wasn't well, her response: ""I'm the one who's sick, almost dead, so who's the worst here?"" My grandmother told her that those words were the exact reason why I made a decision towards her; she again brought everything back to her without taking me into consideration. She did the same thing with my best friend.
I later received several emails from her where she was hateful and tried to make me feel guilty.

I wrote a letter to my mother where I explained everything I blamed her for and I sent it by post.
The only reaction I got from her? An email telling me that she would like to talk to me but that she doesn't want to talk about my letter. What would be the goal then? That's what we should discuss about. Even if I don't really want to do it because we can't talk to her: she screams, cries, insults or gets angry.

I can say it, I think that cutting off contact with her is one of the best decisions of my life, it's also one of the hardest. Even if it's still hard now, that sometimes I'm dying to call her to ask her how she is and tell her ""sorry I'm the selfish one, come on let's forget everything"", in the end I feel so much better for having done that.

Many people do not understand this decision, they think that we only have one mother and that since she gave birth to me, I should accept everything. I think that those who say that have not experienced it; but I do not blame them.

Ultimately, family is not made by blood ties but by heart ties.

And you, what do you think?","I made the difficult decision to cut ties with my mother This is a very long story so be prepared. My English is not perfect either because it's not my first language so sorry in advance.

I have always had a complicated relationship with my mother and this is due to her behavior. I feel like I have been used by my mother all my life.
My mother has always been a mythomaniac (the real disease) but never admitted it and never wanted to be treated.

Let's try to start from the beginning.

When she was pregnant with me, it turned out that she had deliberately stopped taking contraception while my father did not want children at that time. But even if the news was not at the right time, he dealt with it and accepted.
My mother has always desperately sought attention.
1st example: she once went to an appointment with the midwife to have an umbilical fluid puncture; she came back with bruises and scratches on her stomach and explained that they had blindly pricked her. TOTALLY FALSE. These injuries were makeup and she never went to that medical appointment.
2nd example: when she was pregnant, everyone asked her about the baby's health and eventually she felt that she was not receiving any attention towards her but that everything was for the baby. She scratched her belly in front of my grandmother to show her anger and said that she would ""give anything to get that thing out of her belly"". So I was just a thing; a thing to use to give her attention.

When I was born, she didn't take care of me; it was my father, my grandmother and my grandfather who did practically everything.
My parents separated shortly after I was one year old because my mother wanted to go elsewhere. When it came to custody, she simply refused to have it, she gave everything to my father.
She took me whenever she wanted and when I was with her, she didn't take care of me; worse, she mistreated me. She rarely washed me, didn't always feed me well and tied me to my crib with colson (the plastic rods used for DIY). Following this, youth services got involved and she was deprived of any right to look after me (she is my biological mother but cannot sign any papers and is not considered as a guardian).

All my childhood, I was tossed around all over Belgium, I was taken to all his conquests who were often not good people, I slept in garages, under bus shelters, in disused houses etc...
You will say to yourself, how could my father accept that? Well because he did not know. I was a very quiet child, I did not speak much and my mother threatened me so that I would not tell my father or my grandparents about all this. My mother has always been very very intelligent.

Around the age of 11, I began to understand that something was really wrong with my mother. When I understood who she was, I stopped talking to her.
I agreed to get back in touch with her when I was 13; when I saw that she had a roof over her head and that she was with someone decent.
However, the year I was 13 and 14, I suffered extremely traumatic events (sexual abuse from adults, bullying at school, etc.) so much so that I had to spend time in a psychiatric center to treat my depression. It was obvious that the professionals understood that there were problems with my mother and therefore called her in for family therapy. She always refused because ""psychiatrists are for crazy people"".

Despite this, I decided to give my mother a chance and in the end it went rather ""well"". Well, if we ignore the fake fainting fits she had pretending to be a witch and that ghosts wanted to speak through her.
But at 16, everything fell apart. She caught a very aggressive cancer which unfortunately meant that she had to have her womb (uterus, ovaries, etc.) and also her bladder amputated (so she has a bag for her urine). Everything happened one after the other: Crohn's disease, endometriosis, multiple sclerosis, kidney problems, tachycardia, etc.

During this whole period I took great care of her because I was afraid for her life (rightly so) but she was simply odious. It was okay with me because in the meantime I had developed a strong character and I no longer let myself be pushed around like when I was a child; but she was always picking on my brother-in-law. She called him fat, a pig, constantly compared him to me (in a bad way), even told him that if she had heart attacks it was his fault, etc. I often argued with her because of how she treated him.
I developed a very good relationship with his partner at the time who is a golden person, and since I knew that my mother was never going to make him and her son happy, I clearly told him that if he decided to leave my mother, I would fully support his decision. He ended up leaving my mother.
Of course I was happy that my stepfather and my stepbrother were free from my mother but I knew that on my mother's side it was going to be a disaster.

My mother never worked in her life, she never had much money, she always took advantage of men, their money and social benefits. So after her separation from my stepfather, she had nothing left. She found herself disabled and penniless. Fortunately, my stepfather let her have his house for almost a year without asking her for rent (just that she pay the bills) so that she could find decent housing, in accordance with her physical condition and within her budget.

When she moved out on her own, I started to become independent : I started university and I started working. Every month she asked me for money for X things; money that she said she would pay me back even though I knew that this was not going to be the case since she had no money.

I had a pretty busy schedule with work and studies and unfortunately she lived almost 2 hours from my house. So I didn't know how to go see her often, and honestly I didn't even want to anymore.
Every time I went, I had stomach ache and I came home crying or on the verge of a nervous breakdown. My partner started to make me understand that it was time for me to put an end to all this; that he was tired of seeing me unhappy because of her.

She committed acts for which I could have filed a complaint against her even if I did not do so.
She took advantage of the COV** period when we could no longer physically present ourselves at the administration offices to steal my identity and apply for additional social benefits in my name. As luck would have it, I was informed of the situation early enough and was able to stop the process without incriminating her. She did not receive a penny, and that is why I decided not to take legal action.
She has no money, she really struggles to make ends meet and I knew that if I started legal proceedings against her, she would lose everything even though she is disabled. I also know that she stole money from several people and never paid them back.
This is an example of her dishonesty because she never admitted that it was her even though all the evidence pointed to it; she never took responsibility.

When I talk about the fact that she is a mythomaniac I can give as an example the day she explained to me the sexual abuse she received from her father. Her father did indeed abuse her but my mother described to me that he took her fishing where he raped her with condoms filled with maggots. This is obviously false...even if she suffered abuse that was proven (he went to jail), she always had a tendency to add false details and to have hallucinations. There have been so many lies coming from her.
The problem of a person with a mythomaniac is their mania for telling stories that are lies in the eyes of people but that are real for them in their head.
In this situation, people close to them can no longer have any trust in the person, everything is questioned all the time, we doubt everything.

My mother always makes sure that things revolve around her even when it doesn't concern her and even if it can hurt those around her.
For example, one day, we went to have a board game night at some family friends' house. The couple had just had a baby and in the middle of the evening, my mother started crying because ""it hurt her to see a baby when she will never be able to have one again"". It's a pain that I understand because she has always wanted to have a second child...but I think we have to put it into perspective, that she has to be happy for her friends who are not responsible for her medical condition. But I know that she only did that because we weren't really paying attention to her that evening (she wasn't playing with us because she didn't want to, she was just watching). It really ruined the atmosphere.

Another example, more personal, is the day I was told that I had endometriosis like her. Even though it wasn't a big surprise to me, it's still not easy to hear knowing what it can cause. But strangely enough when I heard the news, what worried me first wasn't the fact that I might not be able to have a child but rather how my mother would react. As I expected, my mother burst into tears on the phone with my stepfather behind her, claiming that ""she knew it, that it was her fault (because it's a possibly hereditary disease) blah blah blah"". Ironic to have to console your mother when I was the one who should be consoled at that moment, right? She once again brought everything back to her.
She also repeatedly minimized the menstrual pains that I had by telling me that I had to stop whining because she has more pain than me (which is obvious, I don't question that). No support. She made me feel guilty all the time.

But on the other hand, to everyone, on social media, ... She always pretends to be a model, loving mother who knows her daughter perfectly. It's very frustrating and annoying to see that. I'm being used again to get her attention.

Since I became an adult, all my relatives have told me to be careful with my mother, that if I continued to let her do it, I would lose feathers. I did indeed lose a few, but I always told myself that I suffered less than her and that I had to take it upon myself.

I explained to her that it was not possible because I had just lost a job that I loved and that I was going to have financial difficulties in the coming months.

19732,1htuip5,post,How SA effects you giving birth in the future .....,"So I've never really been open about this before. But I thought I'd share my experience cause no one talks about or prepares you for birth when you have been raped or sexual assaulted in some way. 

When I was 17 I was raped for 2 months by my very first boyfriend. I didn't quite process this until I was about 19 with my daughters father. He helped me really process it all. 

Flash forward to 20. I got pregnant. Everything was great but then my baby girl didn't want to come out. It was past my due date. I did not dialate once. The doctors did a membrane sweep and dilated me 1cm. The sweep didn't bother me cause I was so tired of waiting and wanted her out lol she ended up being 11lbs so I was quite big and swollen. 

My body went from 1cm back to 0cm. She didn't want to come out. I went in for an induction. Since I wasn't dilated at all I couldn't get the medicine IV drip that Induces the labor. So, the first thing they did was put a pill inside me and behind my cervix to help soften it and dialate me. Then after 2 rounds of that they tried putting this string in my cervix with medicine (these two are called Cytadel and Cytotec I think) and that didn't work either. 

Now I say all this and it seems like oh okay I had some doctors doing things to me and it wasn't working. But ever since the first cervix check they did where they put their hand in me I struggled. Through every medicine they had to force into me I said no please don't please don't. And my mother had to soothe me while I cried out in pain and they put their hand in me and pushed my cervix  to get the pill behind it. In order to get me through it my mom would soothe me and hold my hand and whisper in my ear about this flamingo sanctuary in key West. I love the tropics and flamingos. She would describe it in detail and sing to me. (My daughters father held my hand and wiped my tears but I needed my mother in this moment. He was great during the birth)  

At one point I couldn't loosen up at all and the doctor kept telling me to calm down and it got so bad my body tightened on her hand and her hand was stuck in me. I had to focus on my breathing. To have my body release her hand. This happened over the course of 2 days. Being woken up for cervix checks, putting another pill behind my cervix, etc. At the end of the second day they put the string in me again with the gel. They have to force my cervix open to place it inside. It started forcing me to go into labor through the night and I had my first couple contractions. 

I made the nurse take it out, despite her not wanting to cause it was working. I told them that if my body has refused to dialate there is a reason and I don't want to force it. I wanted a c section. They gave in and I had a c section w an 11lb baby the next morning and they told me I was right. And if I had not taken that string out I would have ended up with many stitches in my vaginal area, a large tear, and an emergency c section. 

I have since struggled daily since this happened to me. My GYN has never in my history of being there asked about my past sexual traumas. And I didn't know this would effect me till I was in the hospital. No one talks about this. 

All I can remember is the constant checks and watching the time on the clock tick away for the next round of medicine or check. And I remember screaming and screaming for help. But in reality I was silently crying and asking for it to end when they had their hand in me forcing my cervix open and to move. I think on the inside I was screaming and this is why I remember it this way. 

When I brought it up to her father a month after her birth and that I was struggling he told me there's no reason and it's not possible to have trauma from being in the hospital cause the doctors are there to help. They aren't raping me or assaulting me. And they weren't. But they also weren't sensitive and didn't ask questions about my reactions. 

I'm no longer with her father for other reasons. And have started therapy. It's been almost 4 years since I gave birth and I left that GYN and have a new one and was open with them about my experiences and why pap smear and exams are very hard for me. They are amazing and ask the needed questions to make sure I'm comfortable. I also had them put in my medical records that if I am to have a baby again I WILL have a c section and not a VBAC. 

I just want to put this out there as something to think about for expecting mothers or people wanting to have a baby and to brace yourself or communicate heavily before it's time to have the baby if you have past trauma. I want everyone with past tramua to have a beautiful and comfortable birth of their baby. They all deserve it so much. ","How SA effects you giving birth in the future .....

So, the first thing they did was put a pill inside me and behind my cervix to help soften it and dialate me. Then after 2 rounds of that they tried putting this string in my cervix with medicine (these two are called Cytadel and Cytotec I think) and that didn't work either. 

Now I say all this and it seems like oh okay I had some doctors doing things to me and it wasn't working. But ever since the first cervix check they did where they put their hand in me I struggled. Through every medicine they had to force into me I said no please don't please don't. And my mother had to soothe me while I cried out in pain and they put their hand in me and pushed my cervix  to get the pill behind it. In order to get me through it my mom would soothe me and hold my hand and whisper in my ear about this flamingo sanctuary in key West. I love the tropics and flamingos. She would describe it in detail and sing to me. (My daughters father held my hand and wiped my tears but I needed my mother in this moment. He was great during the birth)  

At one point I couldn't loosen up at all and the doctor kept telling me to calm down and it got so bad my body tightened on her hand and her hand was stuck in me. I had to focus on my breathing. To have my body release her hand. This happened over the course of 2 days. Being woken up for cervix checks, putting another pill behind my cervix, etc. At the end of the second day they put the string in me again with the gel. They have to force my cervix open to place it inside. It started forcing me to go into labor through the night and I had my first couple contractions. 

I made the nurse take it out, despite her not wanting to cause it was working. I told them that if my body has refused to dialate there is a reason and I don't want to force it. I wanted a c section. They gave in and I had a c section w an 11lb baby the next morning and they told me I was right. And if I had not taken that string out I would have ended up with many stitches in my vaginal area, a large tear, and an emergency c section. 

I have since struggled daily since this happened to me. My GYN has never in my history of being there asked about my past sexual traumas. And I didn't know this would effect me till I was in the hospital. No one talks about this. 

All I can remember is the constant checks and watching the time on the clock tick away for the next round of medicine or check. And I remember screaming and screaming for help. But in reality I was silently crying and asking for it to end when they had their hand in me forcing my cervix open and to move. I think on the inside I was screaming and this is why I remember it this way. 

When I brought it up to her father a month after her birth and that I was struggling he told me there's no reason and it's not possible to have trauma from being in the hospital cause the doctors are there to help. They aren't raping me or assaulting me. And they weren't. But they also weren't sensitive and didn't ask questions about my reactions. 

I'm no longer with her father for other reasons. And have started therapy. It's been almost 4 years since I gave birth and I left that GYN and have a new one and was open with them about my experiences and why pap smear and exams are very hard for me. They are amazing and ask the needed questions to make sure I'm comfortable. I also had them put in my medical records that if I am to have a baby again I WILL have a c section and not a VBAC. 

I just want to put this out there as something to think about for expecting mothers or people wanting to have a baby and to brace yourself or communicate heavily before it's time to have the baby if you have past trauma. I want everyone with past tramua to have a beautiful and comfortable birth of their baby. They all deserve it so much.

19733,1hor1jl,post,My parents are... different. Can anybody relate to this,"This is going to be a long story consider it a novel lol

When my biological mother found out she was pregnant with me she made the decision to give me up to my aunt and uncle to raise me and I've been with them since I was born. My aunt and uncle are much older theyre in their 70s and I'm 23F. I will be referring to my aunt as my mom and my uncle as my dad in this story. 

I'll be referring to my biological mother as Tammy. As a child my parents introduced Tammy to me as my aunt so growing up I always thought she was just my aunt. Tammy had 4 other kids and biologically to me they were my 2 older sisters my older brother and little brother. Tammy was unstable, toxic and a pathological liar. When we would go visit her 9/10 it would be chaos her and her 3 teenagers going at it often getting physical resulting in the cops being called to her apartment.
My parents planned to tell me who my biological mother was when I turned 18 they'd plan to hire a psychologist to break the news to me. But that's not how it went down. When I was in 8th grade Tammy offered to give me rides to school in the mornings. The first day she gave me a ride on the way to the school we had a normal conversation but as we got to the drop off line and I was about to get off of the car she says ""you wanna know who your real mother is. I am"" and that's how I found out.

I'm very aware that there are kids out there with evil parents which compared to them my parents and my life was heaven. So I try not to be ungrateful but at the same time I acknowledge that my parents behavior and the condition of my home were not okay. 

My mom is a level 10 hoarder. Boxes and bags of junk and trash piled up to the ceiling blocking hallways and filling every room. The fridge was a black hole of stains, mold, expired food and roaches dead and alive in the food and all over the fridge. We also had dogs and my mom never potty trained them nor took them outside so there was dog urine and feces all over the floors.

My mom also didn't clean so the floors were black in filth. As I got older and went to other people's houses I noticed none of their houses looked like mine they all looked clean and actually looked like homes. I asked my mom why our home looked like this & she'd always answer ""it's because we're poor"" it never made sense. Just because we're poor doesn't mean we can't clean. And for someone who is poor she sure had lots of things.

I was often sick from food poisoning because our fridge was cross contamination in a nutshell. I tried to plead with her many times to clean the house and that I would help her but it never worked. I took it into my hands a few times and cleaned the house it once took me 4 hours just to clean the fridge just for it to go back to how it was in two days, whenever I'd clean the house and throw out trash she would take it out of the trash can and bring it back inside after I spent hours cleaning. I was so embarrassed of my home that I never invited any of my friends over I'd go to their houses instead. 

The house I live in is divided into two houses one side of the house is where me my dad and my mom lived, the other side of the house my dad's brother, his wife and their 3 children lived. Since I was young my mom believed my aunt was stealing from her. If anything went missing she would blame her. I believed my mom and what she told me.. until I turned 10 that's when my mom shifted her focus from my aunt to me. 

So from that point on anything that went missing from the house a hat, a sweater, the remote control literally anything, I was blamed for it. This was a daily occurrence and because she 100% believed I was stealing from her she would retaliate and make my life miserable. Every day she would curse at me, hide her pots and pans so I couldn't cook, hide laundry detergent so I'd have to use my shampoo, she'd hide toilet paper and dish soap.

Since I was a child with no job I asked my dad if he could buy me laundry detergent, toilet paper and he did. I tried to avoid my mom &stay in my room. I would only go out to use the bathroom or wash my clothes I didn't really have an appetite so I'd only eat once a day. When my dad would get home from work he'd go buy food nd get me something. Even tho I avoided my mom, only stayed in my room she still accused me for things that went missing. 

On many occasions I'd do homework in my room and she'd go in demanding me to give her the remote for her TV that I never took. She'd kick me out of my room so that she could watch her show in my room. I was so used to her doing that I wasn't even phased.

Now about my dad, he was an alcoholic when I was a child & although my dad has done good things for me he's also done things that have ruined our relationship which leaves me in the middle of wanting to appreciate him and my mom for the good things they did but also being grossed out by their behavior that i dont want to be in contact with them. The first thing I remember is when I was about 6 years old. At that time my mom and me would sleep in one room and my dad would sleep in the other room. The rooms were next to each other. So every night for a good amount of days up at nighttime when I'd get out of the shower I'd go to my room in a towel and try to get dressed, my mom would also be in the room with me. Then my dad would ask from his room ""are you getting dressed?"" And the first time I said yes and he replied ""I'm gonna go watch"" and he giggled about it. 

One thing about my dad is he's always had a joking personality and talks with a joking tone. Even though I was about 6 years old I didn't want him to come and watch me and I'd cry, tell him to stop but he wouldn't he'd just stand there and laugh. Both of the rooms didn't have proper doors. His room didn't have a door at all and my room had a wooden sliding door with no way to lock it. So when he did that I remember getting this panic of ""what do I do"" & having this thought process of he's walking to my room I don't have enough time to put my clothes on do I jump under my blanket and end up hiding behind my towel and crying while he laughed. my mom never told him to stop the only time she said anything was when I was hyperventilating she told me ""calm down he's just joking"". I tried to make excuses for things my dads done and I could've made an excuse for that if it wasn't for all the other weird inappropriate things he's done.

 There was a time I was about 10 years old It was a Saturday morning I was laying on my stomach my parents walk in my room saying come eat, they had never done that before. I hear my mom walk out of the room and my dad kneeled on my bed squeezed my butt and giggled about it. Although some could excuse that as a playful gesture I could've agreed but because of other things he's done makes me feel gross about him having had done that. 

Another time was when I was in middle school 6th i had a lice infestation. I got this lice shampoo &washed my hair w it, got out the shower so my mom could run a lice comb thru my hair I was in a towel bc i was gonna hop back in and rinse off. So we're in the kitchen, out of all places, and I'm sitting on a chair while she's combing my hair and no exaggeration lice is just falling out of my head what looked like hundreds falling down. My dad decides he wants to help by picking lice off me and there was one that landed above the towel that was wrapped around me and I just remember he was trying to grab it and pick it off but it was hard to get it, it was sliding into my towel so I just naturally lowered my towel but my nipple was exposed and he picked it off my nipple and giggled about it and it made me feel gross considering there's a billion more lice falling out of my head he could've picked any other one of them. 

My dad and mom always used to watch novelas which are drama shows in Spanish. For some reason those novelas always tend to have a rape scene. So whenever a rape scene would show on TV and the woman would be crying my dad would say something like ""eya eya andale cabrona"" I don't know how to translate that but basically saying it's a good thing she's being raped.

A lot of these things started to happen when I was 10 because another thing that he started to do at that age was call me ""chichona"" and ""nalgona"" translating to big breast, big butt he'd even say it in front of my mom and she would laugh. Whenever I'd walk in or out of the room he wouldn't look at my face only my breasts and my butt and my mom would do it too. I know lots of parents admire their kids like wow my baby got so big but what they were doing didn't feel innocent at least not my dad it felt so gross. So I started walking into the room with my arms crossed to cover my chest and walked out of the room backwards to avoid them looking at my butt and they'd just laugh at me like it was funny.

There was one thing my dad said that I've never understood and if he said it in the way I think he did it's another reason I don't wanna be around him. So, again I'm 10 years old and my dad got a call from a neighbor saying two of his cousins named Antonio and Pedro just got here from Mexico he said Pedro needed a place to stay and asked if he could rent him a room. Since the house we live in has two extra rooms not connected to the house out in the yard. My dad agrees and brings Pedro to show him the room outside. I went out curious to see who was moving in when Pedro saw me stopped and just stared at me for a while. The way he was staring felt.. off. The room that he would be renting didn't have a kitchen or bathroom so my parents gave him a key to our house and access to use the bathroom. 

Around this time my parents would often leave me home for hours at a time they would go over to family's houses, to the store or to get something to eat. Leaving Pedro with full access to the house while I'm alone in it. Thankfully nothing to serious happened considering how dangerous that was. But there was a night where my parents threw a party everyone was out in the yard drinking, music and me and my friend who in this story I'll call jen. we were both in my room playing when we needed to go to the bathroom but someone was in there and had been for a long time. 

We knocked on the bathroom door and Pedro answered. He had been drinking his eyes were blood shot and he had a bud light can on the bathroom sink. Jen went in to use the bathroom first and I waited outside of the door. Pedro started talking to me and acting like a weird drunk then jen opened the door and I went in to use the bathroom. I was thinking how jen was outside waiting for me and he might be doing the same thing to her. When I opened the door jen had already gone to my room and only Pedro was standing there. He put me against the wall and started to kiss me trying to shove his tongue in my mouth but I had my lips pressed together super tight so he wasn't able to.

When he stopped kissing me I casually walked back to my room frightened. I remember feeling extremely scared but I didn't want him to know it. I couldn't even lock my door since it was a sliding wooden door with no lock. I walked in my room trying to make it seem like nothing was wrong but I grabbed my phone and called my neighbor who was my friend at the time who I'll call Maria in this story, I told her what happened I also told my friend Jen who was with me what happened trying to be discreet but I started crying cuz I was scared. 

Maria told me to tell my parents but i didn't want them to know what happened I already felt sexualized by my dad the last thing I wanted to do was tell him that this man kissed me. So I went to the kitchen and looked for a knife I found this serrated kitchen knife that was dull at the tip took it to my room & told Jen if he comes into the room I'm gonna stab him. I don't know where that came from but I'd like to think I was prepared to defend myself against this weirdo who had kissed me 10 minutes ago and was still in my house. I had Jen go with me outside into one of the other rooms and hide with me. 

We were in that room in the dark and eventually went back inside. I never told my parents what happened but they eventually found out because my neighbor Maria who I called that day and told her what happened, called my mom and told her what happened. My mom cried hysterically as if she couldn't believe this strange man she gave access to our house could do  that. But I denied it all bc I felt so uncomfortable with them knowing. 

Anyways before Pedro kissed me there was a day where him and my dad were outside in front of the garage I was next to them/behind them. Kids were going home from school at that time. There was a girl w her backpack maybe in middle school and she was walking across the street from our house when my dad points her out to Pedro and says ""y esa?"" translating to ""and that one?"" Pedro takes a few steps forward and stares at her like he stared at me the day he moved in. I don't know what my dad meant by that I can only assume and it doesn't look good. I can only ask myself did my dad know that Pedro was a pdfile and if so why let him live in our house and why did he act surprised when he found out Pedro kissed me. And also what did he mean by ""and that one?"" When referring to the girl walking past our house your guess is as good as mine. 

The thing about my parents is they can be noticeably nice. And them being much older makes them look like a nice older couple. So when I would try to speak about what was happening at home to a close friend, family member I was almost immediately shut off by ""no your mom is so nice"" ""you're trying to say that little old lady does those mean things u say she does? I don't believe you"" ""your dad is so nice my dad would never pay to fix my car like yours did you are so lucky you need to appreciate them"".

When I moved out at 19 i was lonely and because I have an attachment to my parents I can only recognize as the manipulation but also the appreciation I have for the good things they've done I was in constant communication with them &whenever I needed money my dad would send. He let me know I could move back if I wanted, my dad's brother his wife and their three kids moved out so I was able to move into the house they lived in. It is the same house as my parents but it is divided into two houses giving me privacy(or so I thought) my dad would casually spy on me thru a broken piece of the door he told me one day ""I was looking at u watching TV thru the door"" so later that night I taped over the hole he was looking at me thru and the next day he questioned why I covered it.

If I go out at night he questions me about it wanting to know where I was it annoys me because I'm an adult I pay u rent why is he making it a big deal that I went out as if I went out behind his back? I never tried to hide it I believed I was free to come and go as I pleased considering I paid rent. 

His behavior is just as creepy as it used to be hasn't changed and has never showed me the privacy I need as a woman nor the respect. He brings me food every day to my door even if it's his old lunch from work I see it as an excuse or another form of manipulation. I told him and my mom many times don't bring me food I have food here. Resulting in my mom saying I should just accept the food and not hurt his feelings, apparently saying I have food at home don't bring me food would cause him to get upset and sad but idgaf because he's creeping me out.

I recently started to ignore him when he comes to my door and my mom came a couple days ago to my door and said "" I see now that u don't want to talk to us and all I want to say is God bless u"" and though that may sound like a mature response to the situation from her, it's not. She will continue acting out. I chose to live here because financially, it's the smarter choice but putting up with my parents is seriously taking a hit at my mental health. And then there's the guilt of will I take care of my parents when they need to be cared for and I would have but after all they've done it's going to be hard to even consider that. And now I possibly stay with the guilt of choosing to possibly not take care of them as they get older.


Edit: Thank you all so much for the encouraging comments. I feel so spoiled with support. ❤️","My parents are... different. Can anybody relate to this This is going to be a long story consider it a novel lol

My mom cried hysterically as if she couldn't believe this strange man she gave access to our house could do  that. But I denied it all bc I felt so uncomfortable with them knowing. 

Anyways before Pedro kissed me there was a day where him and my dad were outside in front of the garage I was next to them/behind them. Kids were going home from school at that time. There was a girl w her backpack maybe in middle school and she was walking across the street from our house when my dad points her out to Pedro and says ""y esa?"" translating to ""and that one?"" Pedro takes a few steps forward and stares at her like he stared at me the day he moved in. I don't know what my dad meant by that I can only assume and it doesn't look good. I can only ask myself did my dad know that Pedro was a pdfile and if so why let him live in our house and why did he act surprised when he found out Pedro kissed me. And also what did he mean by ""and that one?"" When referring to the girl walking past our house your guess is as good as mine. 

The thing about my parents is they can be noticeably nice. And them being much older makes them look like a nice older couple. So when I would try to speak about what was happening at home to a close friend, family member I was almost immediately shut off by ""no your mom is so nice"" ""you're trying to say that little old lady does those mean things u say she does? I don't believe you"" ""your dad is so nice my dad would never pay to fix my car like yours did you are so lucky you need to appreciate them"".

When I moved out at 19 i was lonely and because I have an attachment to my parents I can only recognize as the manipulation but also the appreciation I have for the good things they've done I was in constant communication with them &whenever I needed money my dad would send. He let me know I could move back if I wanted, my dad's brother his wife and their three kids moved out so I was able to move into the house they lived in. It is the same house as my parents but it is divided into two houses giving me privacy(or so I thought) my dad would casually spy on me thru a broken piece of the door he told me one day ""I was looking at u watching TV thru the door"" so later that night I taped over the hole he was looking at me thru and the next day he questioned why I covered it.

If I go out at night he questions me about it wanting to know where I was it annoys me because I'm an adult I pay u rent why is he making it a big deal that I went out as if I went out behind his back? I never tried to hide it I believed I was free to come and go as I pleased considering I paid rent. 

His behavior is just as creepy as it used to be hasn't changed and has never showed me the privacy I need as a woman nor the respect. He brings me food every day to my door even if it's his old lunch from work I see it as an excuse or another form of manipulation. I told him and my mom many times don't bring me food I have food here. Resulting in my mom saying I should just accept the food and not hurt his feelings, apparently saying I have food at home don't bring me food would cause him to get upset and sad but idgaf because he's creeping me out.

I recently started to ignore him when he comes to my door and my mom came a couple days ago to my door and said "" I see now that u don't want to talk to us and all I want to say is God bless u"" and though that may sound like a mature response to the situation from her, it's not. She will continue acting out. I chose to live here because financially, it's the smarter choice but putting up with my parents is seriously taking a hit at my mental health. And then there's the guilt of will I take care of my parents when they need to be cared for and I would have but after all they've done it's going to be hard to even consider that. And now I possibly stay with the guilt of choosing to possibly not take care of them as they get older.

19734,1hgp161,post,I was SA'd by a friend of a friend then made to walk down the aisle with her,"I've told this story to a few people before, but never in this amount of detail and never described it as SA. I've been going through some shit recently and trying to take an honest look back at things in my life and I think about this a lot and feel it is important to call it what it is and admit that I was raped.

Many years ago, I had just gotten out of a very toxic relationship. My best friend calls me up and tells me to come to a party at his place to cheer me up. He lived quite far at the time and I decided to make a trip out of it and go see him.

I get there and we go get lunch. He's joking about getting me laid and I'm not really into it. Later we go back to his house and his girlfriend is there with one of her friends. He introduces me to the friend. I know immediately where this is going and I go through all the pleasantries, say hello, we chat a bit. He pulls me aside and asks me what I think of her and tells me I should go for it. I say that I just want to enjoy the party and that's not really what I'm here for. He continues to push that I should ""blow off some steam.""

The party gets started and it's clear that she's probably gotten a similar pep talk as she starts to follow me around. I try to be nice but never say outright ""I'm not interested."" I move between groups, try to talk with other people. Eventually she goes inside and I don't see her for a while. I think at this point I'm in the clear. I eventually get really drunk and black out.

I wake up the next morning in my friend's bedroom naked with her next to me. I have no memory of what happened. She's still asleep. There's used condoms on the floor next to the bed. The bedroom door is wide open. The bedroom window faces out into the back yard where the party was. I get up and go to the bathroom to take a shower. She walks in and casually gets into the shower with me. She presses up against me and grabs my penis. I can't remember what I said, but something to the effect of not being in the mood. She doesn't stop touching me and I start to get hard. I sort of freeze at this point and don't know what to do. She kisses me, bends over in front of me and asks me to fuck her. I do it. I don't know why. I wanted it to be over. I couldn't finish. It takes a long time. She talks about how amazing last night was. I get out of the shower, get dry and dressed as quick as a I can and leave.

I get out into the living room and my buddy is there with a few people who must have also slept over after the party. They're all looking at me with grins. I just wanted to leave. My buddy congratulates me, there's a few comments about ""putting on a show."" I feel sick. I feel angry. She comes out and everyone starts talking about getting lunch. I say that I have a long drive and I have to go. She looks upset. I practically run out of the room with my stuff and leave.

Years later, my friend is getting married to that girlfriend. I'm invited to be a groomsman. It crosses my mind that she might be a bridesmaid. I've sort of moved on at this point. I don't want to see her, but the thought of her being there doesn't deeply upset me in any sort of way. I don't ask if she's in the wedding. Once I get there for rehearsal, I see her there. She's a bridesmaid. We're lined up by height and are paired together to walk down the aisle. I don't remember if we said anything to each other, we must have. I don't bring it up, it's been so long, why say anything. I stay away from her outside of rehearsal and the ceremony. While we're getting ready, the day of the wedding, my buddy points it out to me: ""Isn't it funny that you're both walking down the aisle together?"" I feel this overwhelming hurt and rage. I get through the wedding and we more or less stopped talking after that.

I think for years I struggled with this because of what happened the morning after. We had sex while I was of sound mind. I think I always thought that sort of invalidated what happened the night before. But I recognize now that even that wasn't truly consensual. That me getting black out drunk didn't make it okay.

I don't know what I want to get out of posting this. Even writing this all out feels like it helped. I'm tired. I'm hurting.

EDIT: I no longer talk to this friend for a lot of reasons. I recently started getting therapy, also for a lot of reasons. I haven't approached this experience with my therapist yet. I'm not doing great, but I'm trying to get better. Thank you to those showing concern.

EDIT 2: There are a lot of people commenting that she may not have been of sound mind either and could have been pressured, didn't have ill intent, etc. I realize that using the word ""rape"" very much vilifies this woman and even I don't know if that's fair which is a big part of my struggle with this. I genuinely know nothing about what happened that night. The last thing I remember was sitting on the ground and asking someone to get me water. What I mostly have come to accept is that this was a traumatic thing for me that impacted my future relationships. I see my friends who didn't look out for me as the shitty ones here. However, I stand by ""rape"" being the right word because I don't see any version of what happened where my ""friends"" were not involved in those events even after I had made clear I was not interested.","I was SA'd by a friend of a friend then made to walk down the aisle with her I've told this story to a few people before, but never in this amount of detail and never described it as SA.

19735,1hd46nj,post,The sky is red because that's all I've ever known.,"I have felt nothing quite like this before.

An insanity in love that I can’t wrestle with.

I am too far gone and deep into his whereabout I don’t even know where I am half the time. I don’t know where this letter will go – but I’m just letting my fingers lead the way if you care to read it all.

I am employed and working full time, but I have lost myself in many other things. Often sitting in my car staring out the window at the rest of the world going by, living their life. I’m not sure I know what normal is, maybe I never have known what that is. Perhaps I know that the trouble within me is without me, undoubtedly the control that I don’t have over anything going on in my current day to day life. I am a deeply troubled and fearful woman. I am divorced as of November after a long and drawn-out proceeding. It took 2.5 years to divorce my ex, and I am not regretful though I know it’s possible he was the only thing saving me from myself. I was selfish much of the marriage, often needy and unhinged. He himself was no gem throughout, though he grew up in a far different environment than I did. He had a nuclear family and still does – albeit his father did just pass away a year ago. I mention this because I grew up alongside addicts (alcohol, cocaine, heroin) with many of their own traumas. I suffered with them, from many things they did to me, and many things that I should never have seen. I have my own two children whom I have kept safe from the world I have lived in – but I am far from a good mother. I have been distant and too busy since my ex-husband left the house. I have made myself so strapped for time that I don’t spend much with them, even when I am with them. I am on my computer – working – social media – phone – texting. Keeping myself away from the most important part of my life, and I am ashamed of that. I am doing that right now as they run around their empty rooms upstairs.

 

They are empty because I chose to get a divorce and remove the only things stable for them, because I wasn’t happy. Me. I did it. I am taking them from the only home they have known into an apartment that smells like stale food.

 

Their rooms are empty because I had several affairs that led to lies. Upon lies upon lies. Many times, I accused him of cheating – very common for a cheater. I think it’s common because so many feel guilt for straying. I didn’t feel guilt, I felt as though he deserved it. He ignored me throughout the marriage, often denying sex and actively denying spending time together.

“Hey, the kids are at school, let’s take a walk” – no.

“Let’s have a date night!” – We don’t have money. No.
“We don’t need money to spend time together” – I’m tired and want to chill out. (while going into the basement and hermiting himself off from me and the rest of the world). No doubt he was struggling with depression as well as the news that I cheated on him hitting him like a ton of bricks. He did admit later that he never was able to clear his heart of it. Even when he said he did, he never really got past it. Sex was equally disappointing. I was put in cages and asked to fetch and bark like a dog. I hated every minute of it. He wanted me to piss on the floor and eat out of a bowl.

Curl up by his lap and pant in front of him. Occasionally, he would leash me up and walk me around. It usually ended with me chained and strapped to the wall while he either used a vibrator to make me cum or he climbed on top of my and came himself.

I watch porn and hate myself afterwards. I also hate the people in the videos because sometimes they fuck like they are in love.

People fuck me like they can leave after.
They usually do anyway.

I didn’t know that he had a fetish when we met and before we got married. He slowly and little by little came out with it over the years until about year 7 of marriage when everything just sort of kept growing deeper and deeper. The truth is, I went with it. I often encouraged it though every bone in my body was screaming and writhing in uncomfortable fits of rage during. I wanted to find a way to be with him because I was lonely and starving for attention. I fed a fire that I only wanted to be put out for the sake of closeness. My basement became a torture chamber and there it stays, unmoved from the puddles of urine and the countless hours of fights we’d have about spending time together. I want to go down there and scream until the walls bleed out imagery and proof of my discomfort. I want the floor to fill up to my ankles with pictures of my stepfather when I was a young girl raping my small body and beating me until DCFS saw the bruises and took me away. I want to throw my fists into the glass windows down there until they are covered in green witch snot

And cast a spell on the people who have hindered my ability to be a grown ass woman in society. I am not a confident person, I am ugly on the inside.

I want to tell all the “girls, girls” on “Are We Dating The Same Guy” on Facebook to find a hot iron and stick it in their wretched stank ass vaginas for laughing at my pain when others admit to seeing the man that I call my boyfriend anonymously on posts that I create looking to see if he is seeing others. There are several whom have commented as “anonymous” stating they are dating him but of course don’t give any information and leave me with a big F U.

 

One of the affairs I had was with my therapist, who took advantage of my vulnerability and began sex therapy with me in 2022. He said that since I have bipolar disorder, and I am hypersexual – he wanted to help give me a safe person to have sex with because he too was also going through a lot seeing as his girlfriend at the time broke up with him leaving him devastated. I wrote him a letter and emailed it to him stating that I had romantic feelings for him prior to that. I did state that I knew they weren’t real and that it was transference – but I felt he loved me, and I thought we had a connection. I stayed with him for almost two years before I sought help to get away from his control and grasp. Until I fell pregnant after he forcibly climbed on top of me scooted his body up and down over and over until exasperatedly reaching an orgasm. I told him I didn’t want to have sex because “I wasn’t really feeling well”.

 

“YOU? You are hypersexual, of course you want it”. His reply came as no surprise.

I laid there tearful and unmoved. I couldn’t even make myself see the other side, there was no other side, only the reality that I couldn’t do a damn thing about my circumstances.

I still haven’t grieved the baby that I lost. I hadn’t even missed my period by the time the abortion was complete. He named the baby a JR to his after announcing “I’m sorry you are going through this”.

It's interesting because as I re-read what I type, I realize my distance with my two living breathing children may be because I haven’t been able to process the end of my marriage because of so many other things in the background. I don’t think I miss him; I just haven’t been able to cry about him leaving – the tears won’t leave my eyes until now. I am sobbing on this keyboard and I can’t pinpoint what it is exactly.


They are like bullets on my cheeks, stinging the surface leaving red blotches behind as to make sure that everyone else sees them. But no one else would say anything about them, other than to be polite maybe and not say anything at all. If that’s the worse case scenario than I suppose I am lucky. For the record, I am not typing this out and sharing it with you so that I can garner any sort of favor. In fact, I know that by posting this I am only going to open myself up to cruelty and mean-spirited commentary. That’s ok. I suppose I am making an attempt at putting my thoughts out into the world, so they don’t stay inside of my head gathering gasoline for future flames.

I am a lonely woman. I have no real friends.
My phone never rings.
I receive Facebook messages and texts from the men who know me occasionally asking me how I’m doing. They want to fuck me too probably. I’m not even a good looking woman. Anyway, all you must do is have two titties and a warm vagina. Some men would fuck a watermelon because it doesn’t talk back.

These words are dead.

When I began typing this, I was initially going to speak about my current boyfriend whom I am very much in love with. Insanely, stupidly, unreasonably in favor of. He lives two states away and about 1.5 hours from me so it’s a long-distance sort of thing. I’m killing it by being obsessive and sad all the time when we aren’t together. I am acutely aware of his tone of voice changing and when he sounds distant. I am constantly worried he is online and chatting with other women via text. Other women he has dated, is interested in, etc. We are exclusive and yet I can sense that he isn’t going to stick around if I stay like this – but I don’t have a choice because I am currently wading in a depression that I can’t control at the moment. He has cheated on me in the past, I do have proof but of course he denies it. He has reached out to his ex girlfriends asking them to please talk to him. I actually found his profile and a message he sent to a woman on facebook dating and he said “my profile got hacked obviously”. Of course it didn’t. I do deserve to get cheated on though, due to my own bullshit. I fear that I will never be able to live a normal life.

I want to ask “Does this get better?”…. but I know the answer is much more difficult to encounter because it all depends on me. Will I take medication? Will I separate myself from toxicity?

I find ways to fuck up my own life, I assure you. I try to sway coworkers who are men into an attraction circus – only one of them telling me no. I have even had thoughts of chatting up the woman in my neighborhoods husbands so that I can find a way to hurt them like they have hurt me by not even so much as looking my way the last 14 years I’ve lived here in this empty house.

I can’t maintain friendships with women because I always feel awkward. The one best friend I did have we fell out due to the therapist and her blatant disregard for sanctity in keeping secrets. My ex called her to get the tea, and she spilled it all. After calling everyone she ever knew and telling them her secrets as well, we never did recover.

I also have zero family outside of my children. I have made it so. I left everyone on my side of the family because of their disregard for those who have molested me – those they still side with and buddy around with. Weddings, birthdays, gatherings – acting like he’s one of them. So I can’t be with them. My aunt told me I’d regret it because someday I’d need them. I need them, but I don’t regret a thing.

I left my husband, clearly, his family went with him.
I recently left my mother and father with their significants because of their trash talk online about me asking them for money- which I never have and they wouldn’t give me anyway.

Over the course of the last three years:

-          I have gone through 5 cars. Dodge Caravan replaced with a Ford Fusion which was totaled in front of my house by a drunk driver. The fusion was replaced with a ford focus which was stolen in front of my house. That was replaced with a ford ecosport which broke down the day I got it. That was replaced with another ford ecosport that was totaled when I was tboned by someone who ran a stop sign and ended up with me rolling over 3 months ago. That was replaced with a brand new ford escape which was totaled November 20 because I got rear ended by a semi on the highway. I have a new escape now and I’m scared to death.

-          I went through a hellish divorce.

-          Current lawsuit with therapist

-          Current lawsuit with the trucking company who hit my vehicle

-          My house was ransacked by my sister on a drug binge. I hadn’t seen her in a great while and I didn’t know she was on drugs when I let her stay in my home while I was out of town. She stole a lot of my belongings and left her meth kitchen in my upstairs bathroom.

-          Cars broken into twice.

-          Gall bladder surgery

-          Abortion

-          Had my car broken into by the therapist leading to a criminal case and a guilty ruling on his part.

-          Had a surgery to remove my tubes and permanently sterilize me.

-          Multiple failed relationships

-          Moving

I’m a broken person.

I want the floor to fill up to my ankles with pictures of my stepfather when I was a young girl raping my small body and beating me until DCFS saw the bruises and took me away. I want to throw my fists into the glass windows down there until they are covered in green witch snot

And cast a spell on the people who have hindered my ability to be a grown ass woman in society. I am not a confident person, I am ugly on the inside.

I want to tell all the “girls, girls” on “Are We Dating The Same Guy” on Facebook to find a hot iron and stick it in their wretched stank ass vaginas for laughing at my pain when others admit to seeing the man that I call my boyfriend anonymously on posts that I create looking to see if he is seeing others. There are several whom have commented as “anonymous” stating they are dating him but of course don’t give any information and leave me with a big F U.

 

One of the affairs I had was with my therapist, who took advantage of my vulnerability and began sex therapy with me in 2022. He said that since I have bipolar disorder, and I am hypersexual – he wanted to help give me a safe person to have sex with because he too was also going through a lot seeing as his girlfriend at the time broke up with him leaving him devastated. I wrote him a letter and emailed it to him stating that I had romantic feelings for him prior to that. I did state that I knew they weren’t real and that it was transference – but I felt he loved me, and I thought we had a connection. I stayed with him for almost two years before I sought help to get away from his control and grasp. Until I fell pregnant after he forcibly climbed on top of me scooted his body up and down over and over until exasperatedly reaching an orgasm. I told him I didn’t want to have sex because “I wasn’t really feeling well”.

 

“YOU? You are hypersexual, of course you want it”. His reply came as no surprise.

I laid there tearful and unmoved. I couldn’t even make myself see the other side, there was no other side, only the reality that I couldn’t do a damn thing about my circumstances.

I still haven’t grieved the baby that I lost. I hadn’t even missed my period by the time the abortion was complete. He named the baby a JR to his after announcing “I’m sorry you are going through this”.

It's interesting because as I re-read what I type, I realize my distance with my two living breathing children may be because I haven’t been able to process the end of my marriage because of so many other things in the background. I don’t think I miss him; I just haven’t been able to cry about him leaving – the tears won’t leave my eyes until now. I am sobbing on this keyboard and I can’t pinpoint what it is exactly.


They are like bullets on my cheeks, stinging the surface leaving red blotches behind as to make sure that everyone else sees them. But no one else would say anything about them, other than to be polite maybe and not say anything at all. If that’s the worse case scenario than I suppose I am lucky. For the record, I am not typing this out and sharing it with you so that I can garner any sort of favor. In fact, I know that by posting this I am only going to open myself up to cruelty and mean-spirited commentary. That’s ok. I suppose I am making an attempt at putting my thoughts out into the world, so they don’t stay inside of my head gathering gasoline for future flames.

I am a lonely woman. I have no real friends.
My phone never rings.
I receive Facebook messages and texts from the men who know me occasionally asking me how I’m doing. They want to fuck me too probably. I’m not even a good looking woman. Anyway, all you must do is have two titties and a warm vagina. Some men would fuck a watermelon because it doesn’t talk back.

These words are dead.

When I began typing this, I was initially going to speak about my current boyfriend whom I am very much in love with. Insanely, stupidly, unreasonably in favor of. He lives two states away and about 1.5 hours from me so it’s a long-distance sort of thing. I’m killing it by being obsessive and sad all the time when we aren’t together. I am acutely aware of his tone of voice changing and when he sounds distant. I am constantly worried he is online and chatting with other women via text. Other women he has dated, is interested in, etc. We are exclusive and yet I can sense that he isn’t going to stick around if I stay like this – but I don’t have a choice because I am currently wading in a depression that I can’t control at the moment. He has cheated on me in the past, I do have proof but of course he denies it. He has reached out to his ex girlfriends asking them to please talk to him. I actually found his profile and a message he sent to a woman on facebook dating and he said “my profile got hacked obviously”. Of course it didn’t. I do deserve to get cheated on though, due to my own bullshit. I fear that I will never be able to live a normal life.

I want to ask “Does this get better?”…. but I know the answer is much more difficult to encounter because it all depends on me. Will I take medication? Will I separate myself from toxicity?

I find ways to fuck up my own life, I assure you. I try to sway coworkers who are men into an attraction circus – only one of them telling me no. I have even had thoughts of chatting up the woman in my neighborhoods husbands so that I can find a way to hurt them like they have hurt me by not even so much as looking my way the last 14 years I’ve lived here in this empty house.

I can’t maintain friendships with women because I always feel awkward. The one best friend I did have we fell out due to the therapist and her blatant disregard for sanctity in keeping secrets. My ex called her to get the tea, and she spilled it all. After calling everyone she ever knew and telling them her secrets as well, we never did recover.

I also have zero family outside of my children. I have made it so. I left everyone on my side of the family because of their disregard for those who have molested me – those they still side with and buddy around with. Weddings, birthdays, gatherings – acting like he’s one of them. So I can’t be with them. My aunt told me I’d regret it because someday I’d need them. I need them, but I don’t regret a thing.

I left my husband, clearly, his family went with him.
I recently left my mother and father with their significants because of their trash talk online about me asking them for money- which I never have and they wouldn’t give me anyway.

Over the course of the last three years:

-          I have gone through 5 cars. Dodge Caravan replaced with a Ford Fusion which was totaled in front of my house by a drunk driver. The fusion was replaced with a ford focus which was stolen in front of my house. That was replaced with a ford ecosport which broke down the day I got it. That was replaced with another ford ecosport that was totaled when I was tboned by someone who ran a stop sign and ended up with me rolling over 3 months ago. That was replaced with a brand new ford escape which was totaled November 20 because I got rear ended by a semi on the highway. I have a new escape now and I’m scared to death.

-          I went through a hellish divorce.

-          Current lawsuit with therapist

-          Current lawsuit with the trucking company who hit my vehicle

-          My house was ransacked by my sister on a drug binge. I hadn’t seen her in a great while and I didn’t know she was on drugs when I let her stay in my home while I was out of town. She stole a lot of my belongings and left her meth kitchen in my upstairs bathroom.

-          Cars broken into twice.

-          Gall bladder surgery

-          Abortion

-          Had my car broken into by the therapist leading to a criminal case and a guilty ruling on his part.

-          Had a surgery to remove my tubes and permanently sterilize me.

-          Multiple failed relationships

-          Moving

I’m a broken person.

19736,1h3x2q4,post,Questionable encounter from years agi that weighed in me ,"Tw: sexual assault related

Years ago I had sort of reconnected with an ex several years after an amicable breakup. She came to a party weekend with some mutual friends in her city and we had a fun time partying and talking. A couple weeks later she was in my city for work and called me from the bar late at night asking me to take her back to her hotel.

In retrospect, she was just hoping for a free ride back, but at the time I thought based on our recent fun that she wanted to hook up. 

I went and picked her up and drove to her hotel(not a good move to begin with as I had been drinking a little bit). She was very chatty drunk but not obviously hammered or a mess. When we got to the hotel, we kept talking in the car slighlty flirtatiously. I was waiting for an invite up, and retrospectively I think she just didn't know how to leave without feeling rude that she used me for a ride, so we talked for an oddly.long time, like 20 mins in the hotel parking lot, and then she invited me up. 

When we got to her room, we were still in the mode where I was sort of expecting to hook up but she kept chatting. I never really made a move but just hung out talking. I can't remember exactly how it started, but we gradually started making out and began having sex. The sex was... very unexceptionable and fast. After finishing, she seemed to be asleep. It really seemed incongruous since she had been talking and mutually initiating sex, but I thought she felt awkward about bad sex and didn't want to address it, so I went to sleep too.

In the morning, I was still expecting a fun light-hearted wakeup with potential redemption sexiness, but her vibe was very much 'get the hell out of my hotel room I am late and have to get ready for work' so that's what I did.

We texted that day and she was sort of talking about not remembering everything from the night before. Without even thinking about the night's events, I started a dumb bit that would have been normal with our friends and with her at that time, and making stuff up and saying she just didn't remember - mainly that she invited me to her family dinner that night. She obviously didn't want me to come but kinda fell for it and rolled with it. I let it go for a few texts and then gave the haha jk. We sort of finished that conversation...and that was it. She went back to her city the next day, we didn't text each other, and our friend groups never crossed paths.

Several years later when metoo was forefront, I thought back at that encounter and was horrified to think that it might have been way different than how I thought it went. 

What if when I thought we we were flirty and chatting in my car, she felt pressured and didn't know how to just leave? What if she had the same feeling in her room and didn't want me there but didn't feel comfortable saying so? And maybe worst, what if she really was way drunker than I thought? What if she really was blacked out and didn't remember it? What if she really did fall asleep before/during and I didn't notice? What if when I was teasing her about not remembering, she was feeling that I took advantage of her black out? What if she felt that she was raped?

I tried many times to think of the details of how all of those transitions went, particularly how sexy started, but could never remember the exact details. I truly don't think I pressured or even initiated things, but I couldn't say with complete certainty. I was mostly sure the encounter was how i initially remembered it and it fit with our whole previous relationship, but that sliver of doubt or possibility was terrible.

I was haunted by this for a decade. I always feared seeing her. I feared that she was somehow publically accuse me of rape or assault. I feared that she would privately say it directly to me. And I feared that she felt it and was suffering from it. I began dating my now wife, who told me the story of her rape and I was horrifically afraid of how much that would hurt her to hear.

This was 12 years ago and tonight I saw that ex at a bar. She spotted me and came up to say hi. She was happy to see me and we caught up about family. That doesn't necessarily mean anything with certainty, but she definitely didn't seem to be holding ill will, and gave me confidence that the worst interpretation of that night is not accurate. At the very least, many of the scary possible scenarios involving seeing her didn't happen and are no longer hanging out there. 

I've never told a soul this story and am currently trying to process what it means to have this weight gone, and if I can truly let it go.
Thanks for reading and sorry if this scenario brought up anyone else's trauma.

19738,1gww0vy,post,TW// sa and r*pe … What sparked me to be an addict,"I was maybe 6 I remember my family was having a party/gathering they’re all Hispanic so these parties go for a long time. My cousin who’s maybe 2-4 years older than me,I actually don’t know his age exactly, came into my living room where I was and asked me to play with him and I was excited I’m the only girl in my group of cousins I have a handful of cousins and they’re all mostly boys I have 1 cousin who is a girl but she was in high school at the time so my cousins don’t always want to hangout with me. Anyways, I go to his room and he sits me down on his bed and tells me I need to be quiet and next thing I know he’s touching my private parts and grinding on me but our clothes never came off. I don’t remember a lot but I remember that and I remember he made it seem okay like it’s not a bad thing to do this together but it had to be a secret. And then anytime my family had a party I would be excited like I wonder if my cousin wants to play with me today. No one knows about it I never told anyone bc when I realized how bad that was, I was older and I feel like since I didn’t say no and we were close in age maybe it’s not that bad and I don’t wanna hurt my aunt and having her know this. I don’t know I just feel embarrassed and guilty.

In this point of time I am now maybe 7 I had a friend who lived on the ground floor of my apartment complex she once came up to play dolls with me and one day she said we should play in my closet and she started to play with herself and I asked what she was doing and she said she does that and it feels good and I should try it. I didn’t know what to do so she started to touch me and since my cousin does this to me I didn’t think it was bad. Then she started to lick me… if u get what I mean and I was scared but I didn’t want to scream for reason so I just let it happen. And then my mom came in my room and she stopped and pretended to play with my dolls and my mom opens the closet and asks why we were in here and my friend pretended like all we did was play dolls. My mom I think knew something was wrong bc she sat me down on my bed that night and asked me about it and asked me if she touched me inappropriately and I lied and said no and to leave me alone. I don’t know why I lied I feel like I didn’t want my friend to get in trouble. I stopped seeing her bc her family moved shortly after. 

In this point of time I am maybe 14 I moved away from most of my family. My parents decided to move us to the south since cost of living was cheaper and better hopes of owning a home than living in a small apartment. My mom decided I should go visit my family for the summer. I was so excited to see some of cousins and my aunts and uncles and being around my culture. However I forgot about that one cousin. I was in my aunts apartment for the whole summer and I learn the one cousin moved out, can’t remember if it was college or just In general, so it would be me and my two little cousins. Summer was great we had so much fun I loved being with my family. Then my cousin came for a surprise visit and gave me a hug as if everything was normal. I thought maybe he forgot what he used to do to me when I was little. So I thought okay I’ll forget about it too and maybe we can be normal. And we all sat on the couch watching YouTube videos it was whatever my two little cousins wanted to watch. We all were under a big blanket and then he started rubbing my leg. And again I froze like all emotions left my body and I felt nothing. I didn’t move I didn’t yell I didn’t blink just nothing. But that was it. I was scared to sleep. I remember me and some cousins went to the city and got comedy tickets and we couldn’t go in bc my one cousin was too young so we decided to go back tomorrow except it would only my be me and that one cousin. I wanted so bad to just be normal everyone else is normal why can’t we be normal? Then my aunt left us two alone since she had work and we were about to leave to go to a comedy show. Except we didn’t I was getting ready and I was scared I couldn’t ever do my makeup I felt nervous then he came up behind me and kissed my neck. I said “what are you doing?” And he said “just let me do this shut up” and I was too scared to fight back I was too scared to yell I just froze in fear and then I just went emotionless. Ugh I can remember his smell I don’t even know how to describe it but I can remember it. Remembering it makes me want to vomit. He had sex with me. I didn’t make a sound I was just numb and emotionless the whole time. At one time he wanted me to be on top and I said no and he was getting upset and grabbed my neck and I felt like he was going to hurt me in different ways so I gave in and got on top. When it was finally over I remember having tears run down my face but I was crying I felt nothing. I hated myself. I didn’t want to ruin lives like my aunt. She immigrated here got citizenship married a man had kids her husband cheated on her and then she divorced and he’s not the greatest dad. She’s a single mom who works so hard for her kids she loves them so much and she’s such a good mom she’s truly an amazing woman. I just don’t want to ruin her life. If I told someone they either won’t believe me then hate me or believe me and I ruin the family. I remember being in the shower for as long as I could scrubbing my body and no matter what I did I wasn’t clean. And everything around me felt filthy. I hate myself so much for not saying anything. 

This sparked my addiction. 

I started vaping which doesn’t seem so bad for a 14-15 year old. Then I was smoking weed, then I was self harming, then I started taking xans I almost overdosed on xans I was in high school my eyes were rolled back and I couldn’t make sentences I was mumbling I couldn’t keep my head up I was wandering the halls barley walking my friend said I looked like a zombie the way I walked I know this bc my friend took a video of me, I did cigarettes, I did coke, I did shrooms, I did molly, I took a random substance idk what it was someone gave it to me and I took it all I know is it looked like a flinstone vitamin but made u feel like u did coke, and I did oxy. From 14-24 years old. I am currently 24 and I have never ever told anyone about this ever. To this day I scrub my body and I still hate myself for allowing this. Only bright side is I got sober earlier this year in February. My boyfriend is just a great person and he deserves to be with someone who’s sober and more stable. So I got myself together ish. It’s a struggle every day. He and I are together for 4 years and I’ve never told him about this. I think I’m taking this with me to my grave. This here is my first time getting it off my chest and I definitely am not snot dripping crying. Worst part I have 3 more rape and sexual assault stories but I’ll get into that maybe another time.

Ugh I can remember his smell I don’t even know how to describe it but I can remember it. Remembering it makes me want to vomit. He had sex with me. I didn’t make a sound I was just numb and emotionless the whole time. At one time he wanted me to be on top and I said no and he was getting upset and grabbed my neck and I felt like he was going to hurt me in different ways so I gave in and got on top. When it was finally over I remember having tears run down my face but I was crying I felt nothing. I hated myself. I didn’t want to ruin lives like my aunt. She immigrated here got citizenship married a man had kids her husband cheated on her and then she divorced and he’s not the greatest dad. She’s a single mom who works so hard for her kids she loves them so much and she’s such a good mom she’s truly an amazing woman. I just don’t want to ruin her life. If I told someone they either won’t believe me then hate me or believe me and I ruin the family. I remember being in the shower for as long as I could scrubbing my body and no matter what I did I wasn’t clean. And everything around me felt filthy. I hate myself so much for not saying anything. 

This sparked my addiction. 

I started vaping which doesn’t seem so bad for a 14-15 year old. Then I was smoking weed, then I was self harming, then I started taking xans I almost overdosed on xans I was in high school my eyes were rolled back and I couldn’t make sentences I was mumbling I couldn’t keep my head up I was wandering the halls barley walking my friend said I looked like a zombie the way I walked I know this bc my friend took a video of me, I did cigarettes, I did coke, I did shrooms, I did molly, I took a random substance idk what it was someone gave it to me and I took it all I know is it looked like a flinstone vitamin but made u feel like u did coke, and I did oxy. From 14-24 years old. I am currently 24 and I have never ever told anyone about this ever. To this day I scrub my body and I still hate myself for allowing this. Only bright side is I got sober earlier this year in February. My boyfriend is just a great person and he deserves to be with someone who’s sober and more stable. So I got myself together ish. It’s a struggle every day. He and I are together for 4 years and I’ve never told him about this. I think I’m taking this with me to my grave. This here is my first time getting it off my chest and I definitely am not snot dripping crying. Worst part I have 3 more rape and sexual assault stories but I’ll get into that maybe another time.

19739,1gwdvp6,post,I have major Daddy issues that molded me into who I am today,"I am a 42 year old woman, and I am a survivor of sexual abuse. When i told my mother what my father was doing after trying to cut my wrist at 8 years old, I remember her saying to me ""don't worry, I'll talk to him"" like I was telling her he ate my favorite cookie or something... for a while nothing happened, and it was never mentioned again. Then one day me and my siblings were packed in a car with my mon and we were moving across state to live with grandma (my mother's mom). Still, nothing was ever said about what I told her. We lived there for a few months, and that is when my step grandpa started doing things to me. I just took it because, well, I really didn't know what else to do. Clearly telling someone just gets me moved into another bad situation and at least now it doesn't hurt anymore (no penitration). Me and my younger sister would have to stay the night and lot at grandpa's and one of us had to sleep with him and the other had to sleep on the couch and me and my sister would always fight about it. She wanted to sleep on the bed, and i just was not having that. Not for her. So I put myself in that situation. I put myself in his bed. I even fought for that spot.  

When I was about 12, my mom put me in counseling for being an ""out of control kid"" go figure... my very first session and it was like I projectile vomited all the bullshit all over the counselor, poor lady. I told her about my father and what he did, and about his 2 brothers and what they did, and about my grandpa and what he was doing. She brought my mom into the room and my mom acted like it was the first time hearing this. She still swears she doesn't remember me telling her. Says it must have been so traumatizing that her mind blocked it out. Bullshit. It didn't appear to affect her at all, and i was a very attuned 8 year old. 

Anyways, my father got criminal charges, one uncle committed suicide and the other uncle was never even brought up. My grandfather was found out about doing the same stuff to almost all my cousins and got a lot of time, but my father.... well, he got 2 years for stagitory rape. 

After my father gets out, he moves in with his mom. My uncle was living there with his 2 daughters... you get where I'm going with this, im sure. He gets accused, again, and next thing you know he is at my mom and step dad's front door, needing to hide. MY MOM HIDES HIM OUT! She let's him stay the night, knowing there is a LIFETIME no contact order, and then the next day they give him a ride to greyhound... he did get caught finally, and ended up getting 15 years. He is out now, and him and i have been trying to repair our relationship. I love my father. All I ever wanted was my dad. Yes, I am screwed up over it all. I have major issues. Hell, for the longest time I thought i was some sick and twisted kid that imagined and made up sick and twisted shit. I thought i imaged it all. Then one day while sitting in jail I recieved a letter from my father and it started off with ""I raped you from 3-8 years old. I did this because you were the oldest and i thought you could handle it. You are the way you are (self-worth issues) because that is the way I trained you to be"". Getting that letter lifted so much weight off my shoulders. I was no longer crazy. 

I used what happened to me as a reason to reject growth. I turned to drugs and abusive relationships. I went to prison a few times and tried killing myself more times than I can count. I dont know what a healthy relationship is and have never been in one, and i am in my 40's now. I have self-worth issues, trust issues, daddy issues. I had my first kid when I was 15 and was scared shitless to change her or give her baths because i was old my father did what he did because it was done to him, so i always imagined him doing some sort of jeckle and Hyde thing and turning into this monster that had no control over his actions and doing these things. So i worried that if thatcwas how it worked, and he did that because it was done to him... well, it was done to me, too, so i wasn't willing to risk that monster getting into me and me doing that to my baby.... I was so young and confused and so scared of myself... Anyways... my point to all that is that yes, I allowed it to control my life. I allowed my past hurt and trauma to take the steering wheel and decide everything for me. That lost little girl who had such a distorted view and idea of life because the one person who was supposed to protect her and keep her safe from all the evils of this world was the person who introduced her and WAS the evil in her world... And that little girl controlled me. Molded me. Made me who I was. But, there came a point in life where I had to say goodbye to that little girl and let go of it and allow myself to grow. If i didn't, I would have just allowed her to drown me.

 So yea, here I am, a work in progress. I used to be a victim and I played that well, but once a victim mentality sets in, you are always finding yourself as a victim, and i got tired of living like that, so i am now a survivor. I am able to forgive now. I am able to focus and trying to work on myself and love myself. I am able to help others in my line of work, and I am working on understanding that sex does not equal love, as I was once taught as a child. 

Wow. I can't believe I just let this all out like this. I havent been feeling too good with my mental health lately, and I saw a post about someone's mother covering up their father's misconduct with a 16 year old, and suddenly this all came out. Guess I needed it. Thank you everyone for allowing me this. ","I have major Daddy issues that molded me into who I am today I am a 42 year old woman, and I am a survivor of sexual abuse.

19741,1gmax3q,post,I shut down and allowed it to happen. I have no clue how I should have taken this situation. ,"When I was about 14/15 years old, I used to run around the neighborhood with my friend at the time. I’d hang out with her all the time because she lives downtown the street from me. One day I stayed at her house for an entire weekend. Her home life as I look back at it was chaos. Her mom I think did drugs and drank but she worked all the time too so she happened to be home this particular day. She kept telling me how she always wished I was her daughter and such. I thought it was always odd. 
That night as we were going to go to bed, my friend was like hey let’s go take a bath. I said I don’t have a swimsuit. Her mom overheard and said just use one of hers and you’re fine. I said ok. Come to find out she didn’t have an extra one so we just went in naked. We were playing with Barbie’s and all the sudden I felt her toe go into me. I froze. I couldn’t move or anything but I looked at her and she had a sideways grin on her face. I didn’t say much about it because I knew if I said something as a foster kid ( I had already gone through 13 homes in a year) I’d be booted out as I had already been raped twice now. 
I couldn’t muster up the courage to tell this girl it was wrong and I felt violated and she kept sliding her hand on my body. I pulled away and I must have blocked the rest out because I don’t remember much after this except I didn’t talk to her anymore. 

My question is. Is this normal or what happened to me? Is this molestation or just curious teens?  ","I shut down and allowed it to happen. I have no clue how I should have taken this situation.

19743,1gfdpx0,post,I need to let this off my chest. I really need to just let it out,"7 years ago, I was raped. I was 16 or 17. I was groped by my uncle when I was trying to sleep when I went to visit him. He was going to be my god-father, because I really liked him, because he had always been nice to me. I tried to convince myself this had not happened.

I am a gay man, and there were many reasons for me deciding not to tell anyone. The first, I was scared of what that would do to my family. We share trips and holidays, and we love each other a lot. My family is important to me. My uncle is the husband of my aunt and the father of my cousins. Imagining having a cousin say that my father had raped them made me feel so bad, i didn't want to do that to them

On top of that, I have heard my family say that only traumatized people are homosexual. Specially my dad. I didn't want to give them that. I didn't want to make that harder for me in the future, as hard as it is now. I decided to drown that thought out and forget

Up to that point, I had been visiting them regularly for a few years. I normally stayed alone with my uncle playing cards or talking about things in general. Naturally, this stopped after the event. But as I worked towards convincing myself it didn't happen, I lowered my guard.

I fell in love with a guy. He had to leave the country. I never saw him again. He cut me of. I was down bad. I walked around his house to be reminded of him. kept reading our messages and stuff. This is all to give context as to why I was, honestly, on a bad spot

My uncle offered to hang out again. at this point, I had already loosened up. After all, my family kept asking why I wasn't going as often anymore and saying that they- must miss a bit.

So I went one time again, and he started making moves now, as I was awake. he closed a door and got too close. I was scared. I decided to do the same as the first time and just stay still. i don't remember much more.

he kept inviting me. he kept asking me over. I kept going. I felt awful going and coming back. I kept telling him what he was doing was wrong. He said it couldn't be wrong because we enjoyed it. He kept telling me I was enjoying it. And that he cared about me.

He bought me candy like before. shared movies and anecdotes. So many things were normal, and then he'd start kissing me and pulling me and I would lose it. I wanted to move away but my body betrayed me. I said no and he kept telling me to say yes. I thought I was better than that, but I wasn't. I could've just walked away earlier.

He told me we wouldn't be alone, and then we were. He kept pushing me, and I didn't know how to set my foot down, because in the end, I needed him. He was a close friend to me, until all of that happened. Somebody I went to when I was sad and needed support. Somebody who had respected me and my thoughts.

Of course, he wasn't though. He was showing this to me, for months. Eventually, I just decided not to feel anything about it. And, after too much time, I put my foot down. told him off for all he had done. he said it didn't matter if it wasn't with me, he still would just do it with someone else. Said everyone did, even aunt.

I felt disgusted and just left. I still see them, every birthday, every holiday. We still chat, crack jokes. Mom still asks why I don't go as often. Aunt still loves me. he still ""loves"" me.  My cousins still love him.

I stopped going again. Now, even when he does anything weird, I just stare him down and say no. If that doesn't work, I leave.

I wish none of this had ever happened and I'm so ashamed of myself and hate the decisions I made, but I'm terrified of actually opening up at this point. I still try to convince myself it was all his fault when I'm definitely guilty too. I want to go away from all of this

I've never been able to tell anyone the truth about this story, even if I've mentioned to friends the fact that I've been raped and in a bad ""relationship"", but I'm really scared. I don't want them to see that of me. I'm scared of that time and the things I did. Sometimes, it hurts to think about relationships at all, cause he comes up","I need to let this off my chest.

I fell in love with a guy. He had to leave the country. I never saw him again. He cut me of. I was down bad. I walked around his house to be reminded of him. kept reading our messages and stuff. This is all to give context as to why I was, honestly, on a bad spot

My uncle offered to hang out again. at this point, I had already loosened up. After all, my family kept asking why I wasn't going as often anymore and saying that they- must miss a bit.

So I went one time again, and he started making moves now, as I was awake. he closed a door and got too close. I was scared. I decided to do the same as the first time and just stay still. i don't remember much more.

he kept inviting me. he kept asking me over. I kept going. I felt awful going and coming back. I kept telling him what he was doing was wrong. He said it couldn't be wrong because we enjoyed it. He kept telling me I was enjoying it. And that he cared about me.

He bought me candy like before. shared movies and anecdotes. So many things were normal, and then he'd start kissing me and pulling me and I would lose it. I wanted to move away but my body betrayed me. I said no and he kept telling me to say yes. I thought I was better than that, but I wasn't. I could've just walked away earlier.

He told me we wouldn't be alone, and then we were. He kept pushing me, and I didn't know how to set my foot down, because in the end, I needed him. He was a close friend to me, until all of that happened. Somebody I went to when I was sad and needed support. Somebody who had respected me and my thoughts.

Of course, he wasn't though. He was showing this to me, for months. Eventually, I just decided not to feel anything about it. And, after too much time, I put my foot down. told him off for all he had done. he said it didn't matter if it wasn't with me, he still would just do it with someone else. Said everyone did, even aunt.

I felt disgusted and just left. I still see them, every birthday, every holiday. We still chat, crack jokes. Mom still asks why I don't go as often. Aunt still loves me. he still ""loves"" me.  My cousins still love him.

I stopped going again. Now, even when he does anything weird, I just stare him down and say no. If that doesn't work, I leave.

I wish none of this had ever happened and I'm so ashamed of myself and hate the decisions I made, but I'm terrified of actually opening up at this point. I still try to convince myself it was all his fault when I'm definitely guilty too. I want to go away from all of this

I've never been able to tell anyone the truth about this story, even if I've mentioned to friends the fact that I've been raped and in a bad ""relationship"", but I'm really scared. I don't want them to see that of me. I'm scared of that time and the things I did. Sometimes, it hurts to think about relationships at all, cause he comes up",112,53.0,2024-10-30 3:40,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1gfdpx0/i_need_to_let_this_off_my_chest_i_really_need_to/,Neutral

I want to be better I truly do I don't know how to start but let me begin by saying I'm 14 I hope that doesn't matter but I'm a 14-year-old girl and I've decided I'm Pansexual. Meaning I like all genders. Female, male, non-binary or gender fluid. Anything and everything are for me. I'm not ashamed of my sexuality I'm more saddened that God doesn't accept it, I've tried to like guys only. And granted I still do like guys, but I've only ever had girlfriends, Sure online I've dated a few guys but never in real life. Anyways I've already had ""sex"" a few times. Mostly just mouth or hand I've never had a Male part inside of me. I think I have hypersexuality. I honestly don't know how to say no but in fairness i pushed for it to. By the time I was 12 me and my girlfriend were sucking each other's boobs. 13th birthday I fingered her for the first and only time, we broke up I got a new girlfriend like almost a year later. We moved incredibly fast because I really didn't know how to say ""No"" so withing like a week or 2 of us being together I gave her multiple hickeys and i let her finger me as well as the other way around. I have a bad relationship with Sex. Speaking of sex, the reason I'm doing this in the first place is because I have a weird obsession with rape. I honestly don't know what's wrong with me. But I've watched rape hentai videos and there's even this website called Forced Cinema that I go on. Tonight, I spent like 30-45 minutes watching hentai. My brain is so fucked up- I want to stop and never do it again. I was on another website before this one and I was told to do 56 Hail Mary's and 4 Our fathers which I did but I know that's not enough. I want to be baptized, and I want to change for the better. I don't go to church, but I want a better relationship with God. I want to talk in a real confessional, and I want to be baptized but I'm honestly terrified to ask my parents. Anyways yeah that's all I guess... I honestly just want my brain in a better place. I don't want to attract a bunch of Christians or Bapsts because I don't want to be judged... I want any and everyone's opinion. Maybe if I gave my whole life story- Why am I like this? Like tell me straight and honestly what is wrong with me? How do I fix myself without involving my parents.

19747,1euy5ao,post,I struggle to understand my sister's twisted mind and I cut her out but can't stop thinking about her.,"What I am writing here I have learned from other people and then from my brother. After our parents passed (quite young, around their 40's), my sister (I will call her Karen) took care of our teenage brother Tom. She had the sole custody (as she lived closer to my brother than me) and the government's financial help to do so.

Teenage Tom was living alone in a two-bedroom council flat. She was checking up on him regularly. The flat was too big for one person, and there appeared an opportunity for us to change this flat for a studio flat that we would have ownership of, but it needed some restoration.

Karen asked me to send her a large sum of money to help her make this change happen saying that to get this flat we have to pay (80'000), but I didn't have any and sadly had to say no. My sister then said that she would pay for all herself, but I won't be the owner of the studio flat and won't have my permanent address there. She asked me to remove my name from the council flat, which meant that on my ID I wouldn't have any address given, meaning seen as homeless. Sounds odd, but at that time it was a little bit stigmatizing and seen as something dodgy.

Well, I didn't want to be a burden, I didn't live in that flat anyway for years and I agreed to that to help my brother to have his own place to live.

Karen had a wealthy boyfriend and she had a very well-paid job and they bought their own flat in the capital city.  She knew that I recently suffered from a brain virus that wiped out my memories and I struggled to remember how to get to work and find my rented room after, and obviously to keep a job, although I always worked somewhere for the minimum wage, she still made me feel very guilty that I couldn't give her money to help our young brother. She did not want to tell me how much money she gets from the government to support him, I had to learn this myself, and it was shocking to learn, that she had not only enough to support him fully, but twice as much as I was earning.

Some years later I tried to get my first loan in my life from my bank, but they said, that I already had one. The person who worked in the bank was kind enough to check it properly for me and said, that the loan was paid regularly and in my best interest is not to report it anywhere as it is really big and reporting it would cause me more trouble than good. So I left it alone. I contacted my brother asking if he knew anything about it and he said, that my sister took that loan in my name, pretending that she was me.

When I tried to confront her about it she stopped replying to my emails. She did not deny anything. She persuaded my brother to forge my signature. I still don't know what exactly she has done to make it all happen. A few months later I learned from the people who she swapped flats with that not only she didn't have to pay anything for the change of flats, but also got a substantial amount of money from them.

I still can't understand why she lied to me and tried to get the money from me. Did she do this on purpose so I wouldn't claim anything from her?

After Tom reached his adult age and she stopped getting any government funds she kicked him out of the studio flat and sold it keeping the profit. I bought a mobile phone for my brother and pre-paid his account asking him to contact me whenever he needs anything. He did only a few times, but then he stopped. I managed to find him and asked what happened. He had some party going on but said that he sold the phone because he needed money. I was surprised that he didn't ask me for the money. I decided then that he was old enough to now understand that actions have consequences and I never called him again, leaving an open door for an email communication. We exchanged emails occasionally, I feel he enjoyed our conversations but at some point, he just stopped. I tried to ask Karen if she knew anything about what was happening with our brother, but she never replied.

She never told me that she sold the flat. She actually kept asking me for money for the flat's restoration, but at this time I suffered from depression after I was raped by my manager. I was all alone in a foreign country with no support from anyone and at some point I had a breakdown and couldn't work. I was on the verge of homelessness. When few years later I was told that she sold this flat when I was facing the possibility of being homeless I felt totally betrayed.

Once, when I visited her she said that she had got married and did not invite me because she was worried that it would make me feel sad, that she had got married first. I wasn't upset, just very surprised as I never said anything to make her believe that. I would never even think this way. I was happy for her and congratulated her. Out of guilt, she gave me a lime green jacket I didn't like and was it was too tight for me anyway. I eventually accepted it thinking that if it will make her feel better I shouldn't say no.

A couple of weeks later she asked me to send it back, stating she never gave it to me, and that she just lent it to me. The postage costs to return it was a bit much for me at that time, but I did send it back.

Another time when I visited her we went to a disco party. She wasn't a good dancer. I was. I actually have won a few dance competitions and I was a dance teacher for a short while. I never told her that she wasn't good, I actually complimented her throughout her life thinking that she would feel good hearing a good word from me about her moves. At that disco she said to me, that I don't dance to the newest trends and that I embarrass her with my old-fashioned moves. It made me feel uncomfortable and I didn't enjoy the rest of that evening.

I do have the impression that Karren gains her confidence by pressing others down.

I have lost interest in staying in touch with her. She sent me an email that she has a 3y old son never mentioning that she was pregnant.

Recently somebody told me, that she got divorced and that their son lives with his dad. I wonder how many years will take her to tell me that.

Her ex-husband contacted me if my daughter would want to stay in touch with their boy. I asked my daughter if she was interested in knowing her cousin. My daughter said no.

The way the request was formed made me believe that it wasn't her ex-husband writing to me, but the boy himself (using his dad's LinkedIn account). It puzzles me.

My brother started his own family too, but he didn't support his girlfriend and their daughter and they split. I was supporting his daughter by sending some lovely kids clothes, toys, a pushchair etc but at some point, she married someone else and didn't need my help any longer. They live in another country and they don't use social media.

Someone told me that my brother is or was in jail. I have no idea how to learn where is he and what he has done to be there. Maybe he didn't pay alimonies?

I feel sad, that my family is so disconnected. It bothers me. I am autistic and not understanding all circumstances makes me feel super anxious. It makes me feel like a bunch of puzzle pieces are thrown in front of me, but they are incomplete and I have no way of putting them together. It's very hard to just throw them away.

There. All blurted out. Maybe it all will stop bothering me now. I really hope so.

Do you think you can summarise it for me? What should I do? Should I do anything?","I struggle to understand my sister's twisted mind and I cut her out but can't stop thinking about her.

19748,1e3r1yt,post,my whole family thinks i’ve been sober for the past year… ,"I’m 19 (f) and about a year ago a spiraled into a really horrible state of addiction. 

it started with drinking, i moved out for the first time and had a lot of free time, i started drinking more bc i was bored. 
the house started to creep me out, keeping me up at night, so i started drinking to fall asleep. 
it spiraled over the course of 2 months ish to me drinking all hours of the day. Taking shots in the bathroom at work, as soon as I woke up, as soon as i did anything really. I felt more drunk when I stopped drinking and it got really bad really fast. I realized I couldn’t not drink and at one point when i ran out of alcohol i started hallucinating. so instead of addressing the problem i just kept on drinking. 

my roommate stopped coming home because she said she was “tired of watching me kill myself.” 
i didn’t realize it at the time, but i legitimately looked like i was dying. 
and i was dying 

I don’t remember anything leading up to it but i fell into a drug binge. 
I stayed up doing coke with friends for days on end, and when i ran out i would pop a xanax to help me sleep it off. I slept for 2 days at one point (according to my roommate). 

One night after falling asleep after a coke binge (no xanax involved) I had two back to back seizures. thank god my friend happened to be in my room. it was a terrifying experience, the most terrifying and traumatic experience of my life and I have such horrible PTSD from it but I never talk about it to anyone. 

after i got back from the hospital i ruled out cocaine. i don’t remember how the next part started. I just remember “waking up” and a week had gone by and i had been doing benzos and oxys for the entire time. I don’t remember a thing and it’s terrifying. I know that the guy who was giving them to me had laced me with fentanyl, which led to me overdosing and back in the hospital, and i’ve been told that he also raped me. 

i could go into a lot more detail but I ended up in rehab for a while followed by intensive outpatient treatment. 

i’m 19 now and everyone thinks i’ve been sober since, i mean to be fair i really have gotten my shit together. I started my first year of college straight out of rehab and finished with good grades. I’ve made good friends, found a healthy relationship, moved into a new apartment, started teaching art classes, and have genuinely been relatively happy. 

but i’m not sober. I was actually only sober for 3 weeks. 

All i can say is that i feel i have control now, but im sure i said the same thing then.","my whole family thinks i’ve been sober for the past year…  I’m 19 (f) and about a year ago a spiraled into a really horrible state of addiction.

One night after falling asleep after a coke binge (no xanax involved) I had two back to back seizures. thank god my friend happened to be in my room. it was a terrifying experience, the most terrifying and traumatic experience of my life and I have such horrible PTSD from it but I never talk about it to anyone. 

after i got back from the hospital i ruled out cocaine. i don’t remember how the next part started. I just remember “waking up” and a week had gone by and i had been doing benzos and oxys for the entire time. I don’t remember a thing and it’s terrifying. I know that the guy who was giving them to me had laced me with fentanyl, which led to me overdosing and back in the hospital, and i’ve been told that he also raped me. 

i could go into a lot more detail but I ended up in rehab for a while followed by intensive outpatient treatment. 

i’m 19 now and everyone thinks i’ve been sober since, i mean to be fair i really have gotten my shit together. I started my first year of college straight out of rehab and finished with good grades. I’ve made good friends, found a healthy relationship, moved into a new apartment, started teaching art classes, and have genuinely been relatively happy. 

but i’m not sober. I was actually only sober for 3 weeks. 

All i can say is that i feel i have control now, but im sure i said the same thing then.",627,203.0,2024-07-15 10:03,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1e3r1yt/my_whole_family_thinks_ive_been_sober_for_the/,Neutral
19749,1cjdf6i,post,Girl on elevator might have been drugged and I did nothing.,"Almost one year ago on a cruise a girl and a man get on the same elevator as me (I say girl but I really don’t know how old she was, the man looked like he could have been her father). She was wobbly and the man she got on with was holding her arm to keep her from wandering around, she looked very zoned out wasn’t saying a word. I got worried thought about asking her if she was okay even though I knew she wasn’t. She was so out of it, the guy she was with looked very annoyed as if this happens a lot.

I had no idea what to do it looked bad but I didn’t say or do anything because “there are so many cameras around no one would do that right?” & nobody else on the elevator seemed concerned.

I feel so ashamed that I let the fear of being wrong and causing a scene stop me from potentially stopping someone from being raped. Please stay safe out there.

Edit: thank you to everyone that commented. It was nice to hear point of views on this, I’m sure I’ll always hold shame with the memory but i will try to let go.

I started taking care of my mother almost 9 years ago. I was adopted by my step grandmother.. through my grandfather who had adopted me, kiil8ng himself... to trying to help diagnose my deep depression... to being not okay with me contacting my birth mother... who had stayed in my life as a child as my grandfather's favorite. I feel like trash. I feel like i didnt do enough. Through my half sister that felt sickly disconnected and forgotten.. even though she was well taken care of... who crossed my boundaries about my relationship with OUR mother. Who hated me for not being more willing to subject her to the pain I had to endure alone. Being told by my birthmother it was easier to talk to my sister because she didn't have the terrible feel8ngs of loss about her... Losing my grandfather, my person.. losing my mother... his person... losing my sister.. my biological grandmother. Being told I was wrong for not reaching out. Taking care of my unrelated parent who was the only person I had... and having to decide to listen to shittalking or being an adult at 23 to take care of the person that continuously saved my life. To losing her. And my dog... to poor understanding from me about how detrimental it was getting. Losing my favorite job.. my soul, my mother, my worth.  And having to keep going alone.


I feel so defeated. I hadn't called her I a long while because seeing her at the window in my door saying she needed to leave to see her daughter injured me.. my mommy. Who helped me even in her diagnoses feel okay after being raped. Who held me even in her bad days, wanted to best the shit out of me because she thought I was a stranger.

I feel so lost. I feel so beaten. And all I want is mommy.","My mother has been facilitated for 2 years and I told people she was dead. EDIT: It took me a while to be able to face this post. I was definitely drunk and was overwhelmed and trying to find an outlet to expel. Thank you everyone.

19752,119hrtt,post,I am a former teenage alcoholic and I have developed crippling real event OCD and false memories,"



































When I was 16-17M I had a drinking problem. I would drink whenever I could get my hands on alcohol because it was the only way I knew how to escape. I would do all kind of stupid shit when I was drunk, try to fight people, verbally abuse people for no reason, throw up in peoples houses etc. i would often get angry at my parents for no reason and once I even had a fight with my dad. 

2 yrs ago aged 17 I met up with 3 girls and a male friend. I had had a lot to drink at this rate. I was sitting in a bench with one of the girls and I put my arm around her. She did not object to this so I thought I was on the next stage of flirting. I asked ro kiss her, she said no to that. A minute later I asked again and a minute after that I asked once more. All 3 times were rejected. Eventually i came to my senses and realise my attention was unwanted. I feel as though if I was physically stepping the line someone would have intervened. I cant actually remember any of this happening, this is just what I got told. I never forced myself on this person and I didn’t get aggressive or violent when rejected. After this happened she and all her friends left the venue and texted my friend that I fucked up and that no means no. I probably freaked her out bad. I didn’t understand what I was doing and I thought I was flirting but I got it horribly wrong and upset someone 

Everyone alienated me after this, all 4 people involved stopped talking to me. My friend was extremely angry with me and started calling me a harasser. 
Due to the response provided I have false memories of what happened. I only asked for a kiss but my mind keeps telling me that I groped/raped her because of how angry everyone was after the situation. I live in constant mental imprisonment. 
I know for a fact I had no bad intentions but in my drunken state I got it horribly wrong. 



 When I heard about my actions the next morning I felt disgusted with myself, I instantly apologised to the girl I did it to. 
Looking back it was quite s lame apology, I said some shit like “I’m sorry if I made you feel uncomfortable last night I was really drunk” i didn’t know what to say
She told me she forgave me, my friend told me that she was initially upset after it had happened that I pushed her boundaries, but she accepted my apology. I don’t know if she just said this to make me feel better or what not but yeah. That was the last time i spoke to all the people involved. I feel disgusted within myself, I feel like a predator who kept pushing someone. I feel as though I might have traumatised her and ruined her life cos this was such a bad experience. It was after that I stopped drinking alcohol as a whole because I was now aware of its destructive nature. I haven’t done a thing of this nature since and realised that it was the alcohol dictating me. 

After I apologised I didn’t think too much of the incident, but 18 months later for some reason it’s come back into my mind and it’s all I think about 24/7. I really can’t understand why I did what I did. I certainly wouldn’t have done it sober, but I’ve realised that it’s no excuse. Their friend said to my friend it wasn’t that much of a big deal but I still can’t forget about it. 
I feel like a piece of shit for trying to do something without the other person’s consent. I was verbally asking for consent but I was being pushy about it. 
Since this has been of my mind, I haven’t allowed myself to have anormal life, I’ve since quit my job and I hardly leave my room. I feel as though this is who I’m gonna be forever. That drunk idiot that kept asking. I told one of my friends bout it and he said it wasn’t a big deal. I can’t even look my own mother in the eye knowing the way I treated a woman that night. No charges were ever pressed or anything, idk if I did something illegal or not but it was certainly immoral. 
I don’t know if asking for a kiss more than once is illegal (might fall under harassment) 
But I feel I should’ve received some punishment for my actions 
I hate myself for it every day and I’ve been thinking about ending my life over this. Once u do something like this in todays society there is no going back. 


Although im 2 years sober and wont do something like this again I just cant let the past go. This haunts me 24/7 and honestly, I don’t think I’ll ever forgive myself for it. 
I thought of myself as an ally of women but this situation says that I wasn’t. 

I’m a pig. A disgusting man who ignored boundaries. I’m sorry to all women that have to deal w shit like this. I’ve heard some horror stories from some other girls and the stuff u have to put up with us disgusting. I wouldn’t consider myself a part of that domain but this encounter proves otherwise. 

I physically cry my eyes out when I see my mother. I’ve failed her, she told me to respect women growing up and I fucked it.","I am a former teenage alcoholic and I have developed crippling real event OCD and false memories

19754,mou8om,post,"Last time I spoke with my mother, I said some pretty nasty things, now she gone I'm still carrying the guilt.","When I was younger I had a pretty rough up bringing, some might say i was ""dragged up"" living in London. I was involved in gangs and crimes from the age of 11, I wont get into the details, but let's just say those crimes would land me in prison for life. But I made money, had connections and knew how to handle myself even when dealing with adults.

My mother was an addict and while her intentions may of been good, she was far from it. Drugs, sex work and a violent tendency, I can recall spending a lot of time behind the scenes of an escort business.. non the less, when your mother tries to stab you in your front garden in front of rush hour traffic and you're not fazed, that's pretty nuts. I later found out she was bipolar and suffered with other mental health issues.

Things started getting pretty rough (by my standards), as I ended up leaving home and sleeping on the streets at 13 for a few months. Some of the things I did to survive are some of my fondest and darkest  memories, like finding a dude sleeping in a dumpster after kicking it, then we become thick as theives... we were theives.

Eventually my grandmother found out about my situation and essentially rang me on my self bought Bomia 5110 me to get to the local train station, pick up a ticket get to her house, this was because I refused to go home or attend school. I moved in with my grandmother and slowly but surely started to get back on track. Sure I was still an asshole teen, but I wasnt worried out being shot,stabbed or raped on the daily. 

Eventually my mother decided she would move closer to me and try and rebuild our relationship.  At first things seemed to go well, but eventually I could see, nothing had changed, when she pulled out a bag of weed and rolled a joint, then proceeded to light up in my bed room. This resulted in us talking and getting along.
*Now I should add here my grandparents know nothing of her antics or my history, I kept my past and dealing hidden from my grandmother best I could*

Sometime passed and I was going back to school and still upto my old tricks to make money. But I was generally behaving and focusing on school. Not long down the line, I found out my mother was using again and she kept trying to borrow money from me to feed her habit. 

I recall going to meet her and give her a hand full of cash and tell her it was payment to never contact me again, I ended up having a huge argument with her, looking her dead in the eyes and said ""I wished you just fucking die"" turned around and walked away. The next time I would see her was at her funeral. I later found out that she died from a opioid overdose. 

Too this day, while I dont blame myself for her choices, I feel this constant guilt that my final words and request made to her was that statement and I kinda just needed to get it off my chest. 

These days, nobody knows about my past, I have a good job, family, friends who all love me and look upto me as some strong stoic bastion on reason and level headedness, little do they know that I just hide my demons better than most.","Last time I spoke with my mother, I said some pretty nasty things, now she gone I'm still carrying the guilt.

Dwelling on this subreddit has filled me with some pretty upsetting/depressing/generally negative emotions that stick with me for a while long after I’ve found out about them since the depressing stories on here (mostly the rape stories)  just immerse me in these thoughts and feelings which isn’t surprising given how dark this sub is but I feel like I’d just be abandoning these people and not acknowledging what’s happened with them if I just stopped going on here, not to mention Reddit is an addiction for me.

As a result I’ve resorted to taking shots of hard liquor.

As of now, I’ve discovered alcohol as a coping mechanism and it’s a quick and easy way of pushing all the bad feelings and scenarios out of my head for a bit.

When wine, marsala, scotch, and tequila are easily accessible, naturally I use them to my advantage. 

I’m 16 and I know this behavior is destructive, which is why I’m here but again, I feel these people need acknowledgement and my instinct just tells me it’s wrong to just leave them abruptly.

I’m 16 and I know this behavior is destructive, which is why I’m here but again, I feel these people need acknowledgement and my instinct just tells me it’s wrong to just leave them abruptly.

Dwelling on this subreddit has filled me with some pretty upsetting/depressing/generally negative emotions that stick with me for a while long after I’ve found out about them since the depressing stories on here (mostly the rape stories)  just immerse me in these thoughts and feelings which isn’t surprising given how dark this sub is but I feel like I’d just be abandoning these people and not acknowledging what’s happened with them if I just stopped going on here, not to mention Reddit is an addiction for me.

As a result I’ve resorted to taking shots of hard liquor.

19757,ft4ijw,post,Submission Guidelines - Read before posting.,"In an effort to eliminate some of the confusion here is a detailed breakdown of the rules. If your submission was removed it violated one of the following.

&#x200B;

Rule 1: All Submissions must be a confession

&#x200B;

All submissions need to meet the requirements we set for being a confession. Anything “wholesome” does not belong here, period. Cutesy stories about the quirky things you do with your husband/pet/child do not belong here.

**All post are required to be about an immoral or illegal act you, the poster, have committed, with malicious intent**. Your confession can not be what your sister/roommate/step-father did. It can not be a rant about the terrible things other people have done to you. It can not be an accident or innocent mistake on your part. This sub is specifically for people who have done horrible things and want to come clean and talk about their misdeeds. It is not a place to brag about things you've gotten away with, farm karma with amusing stories, or just generally vent about your life.

To reiterate; bragging in any manner will get your post removed. If the sum of your confession is that you stole/cheated/lied, it worked out wonderfully for you and you're happy you did it, then your post is getting deleted. We do not encourage bad behavior.

To be clear, all misdeeds have to be actual actions. **As a policy we do not judge thoughts to be immoral. This means emotions, thoughts, dreams, fantasies, and opinions are not confessions unless you have acted on them**. You can not confess to things that haven't happened yet, or other hypothetical situations.

* Feelings are not immoral acts and therefore not confessions.

ex. *“\_\_\_ died and I feel nothing”, “I hate my \_\_\_”, “ I'm jealous of \_\_\_”, “Here are my thoughts on \_\_\_\_""*

&#x200B;

* This is not the place to post embarrassing stories or little-known facts about yourself.

ex. *“I'm 26 and didn't know \_\_\_” , “I'm \_\_\_ and a virgin” , “ I haven't seen the movie \_\_\_”*

&#x200B;

To reiterate; this is not r/todayilearned, r/tifu, r/Showerthoughts, r/humblebrag, r/unpopularopinion, r/pettyrevenge, r/sex, r/relationships, r/depression, r/casualconversation, or r/offmychest. All those subs already exist for a reason, so please go there to post those types of stories. They do not belong here and will be removed.

&#x200B;

Rule 2: All confessions must be specifically titled

This one should be simple – **no clickbait allowed**. All titles must specifically say what you've done. It can't be a random conversation quote, open-ended question, or a single word. If you can't title your post appropriately, then chances are you didn't do anything to confess to, or you're being obstinately vague in the hopes of getting more attention.

Your post shouldn't read with any uncertainty. If you did something, say what it is. The general idea is that your title is a TLDR synopsis. Vague titles will be removed, no exceptions.

ex. *“I must confess...”, “I ruined \_\_\_\_'s life” , “kleptomaniac”, ""I can't forgive myself"", ""I'm a liar"", ""I did something horrible""*

&#x200B;

Rule 3: We do not encourage bad behavior

We do not allow post that glorify, attempt to normalize, or feature gratuitous instances of rape, animal abuse, racism, or violence. As a general rule do not post if these are the subject matter and their removal will be done at our discretion.

&#x200B;

Rule 4: No relationship-related post

This one is very simple; we do not allow any post regarding relationships and will remove them. Notice it does not say ""romantic relationship"". It does not matter if you're ""just friends"" or they are your FWB. **If your post is centered around a relationship, romantic, sexual, financial, or otherwise, it will be removed.** This is not the place to vent about drama with your social circle or your love life.

ex. *“I still love my ex”, “I ghosted \_\_\_”, “I have a fantasy about \_\_\_”, ""I no longer care about \_\_\_\_"", “I have a \_\_\_ fetish”*

&#x200B;

Rule 5: No pedophilia

We do not accept any post regarding sexual situations minors. This includes stories of abuse that had happened in the past. There are no shades of grey with this rule; if there is talk of sexual abuse and children it will be removed.

&#x200B;

Rule 6: Limited content

In addition tot he title, the body of your post needs to give content to your submission. We do not accept vague or cryptic post that do not explain your confession.

&#x200B;

Rule 7: No politics

Politics do not belong here. This aligns with rule 1, as this is not the place to post your opinions and start arguments. There are plenty of subs already for that purpose. Take it there.

&#x200B;

Rule 9: No Trolling

Do not post spam, memes, shitpost, jokes, etc. We ask that you try to meaningfully contribute to the conversation.

&#x200B;

Rule 11: No self-advertisement or crowdfunding

Due to constant scams and abuse we do not allow any form of crowdfunding. Routinely we get post about someone's unfortunate situation followed by a paypal link. If you are fishing for donations or just posting spam in the form of advertising your youtube channel, twitch, onlyfans, etc, you will be banned.","Submission Guidelines - Read before posting.

19758,ec8vs9,post,"I found put my niece was being molested, and i didnt go to the police.","TL DR: Five years ago I was visiting my sister and her family for my nieces tenth birthday. I was asked to make her cake so I was super busy. Suddenly I noticed my niece acting strangely with her phone and I guess my mommy instinct kicked in and I snatched her phone. I found 30 selfies she had taken topless. Make up and bedroom eyes. Being a victim of molestation myself, I screamed enternally. 
    I waited till the fetivities were over and pulled her mother aside and was met with, ""im sure it's not what you think"". I died inside. Later that week I told my mother and was told ""you went to the wrong parent, and if you dont drop it, you will deatroy the whole family"". I stayed quiet.
     Later that year on labour day I went to sleep at the same sisters house very drunk on the couch. I woke up to someone having sex with me. I woke up with my pants around my ankles, freaked and drove home as fast as I could. I didnt tell anyone. I turned to even more alcohol and then meth. I was an honors student in college and dropped out. 
    My sister asked what was up and told her that i thought her husband raped me. He was the only man there that night. It ruined our relationship. I was ostresized from the family for being a drugged out, attention seeking liar for 4 years. 
    At the end of those 4 years I was completely clean and had been, and happy. I got a call from my mother that my nephew from another sister was charged with aggravated molestation of the niece in question. He had been molesting her since she was 4. He confessed to it all. Then it made sense. He was there that night. Later i got a sobbing facetime call from my sister and her husband telling me they know what happened to me and they were sorry they didnt believe me then nor what I warned them was happening.
     I hate myself because I could have prevented 4 extra years of torture. The family was torn apart. The mother of my nephew called my niece a liar and a whore, at 10, and nobody but the mother of my niece, her husband and my niece know what happened to me. My niece and her parents got therapy, my nephew is in prison and his mother is shunned. 
    I dont need closure, my niece is vibrant, happy and prospering. We gaze at eatch other at social gatherings with a shared sense of understanding and happiness and I am happy for her.

19759,e3csd1,post,I was a title IX violator in college.,"Don’t worry, I didn’t rape anyone.  When the semester began and everyone was moving into the dorms I got blacked out drunk on High Gravity and Steele Reserve 211 and ran through the dorms naked.  Apparently, I say apparently because I don’t remember doing this, but apparently I flashed someone multiple times and they turned me into the University system.  The RAs actually found me in my room blacked out drunk and called the ambulance for me.  I woke up in the hospital.

I had no idea how much trouble I was in until I attended a meeting with the Dean of Students and a bunch of other administrators and they told me what I had done.  This fucking shattered my life into pieces because I’m a very introverted and shy person who for some reason was always afraid to be labeled a weirdo by everyone.  I was picked on a lot in high school and I was the weird kid too. 

Anyways I was kicked out of the dorm but not expelled.  Instead they put me onto the strictest probation they could put someone on and my life came crashing to to ground after that.  I became a full fledged alcoholic and was homeless for about a week then I found a roommate, an older woman that was about the same age as my mother.  

I continued to spiral out of control and neglect my classes, not even bothering to withdraw no matter how much my professors contacted me.  Eventually I ran into a friend I made when I wound up in jail the previous semester for shattering a door to a popular bar that everyone hung out at on the weekend (I don’t remember doing this either.). Anyway my new friend introduced me to meth and within a month or two I was homeless again.

After freezing ass for about a week and staying at the homeless shelter I gave up and went to the Catholic Church and asked them for a bus ticket home.  My mind was pretty gone by this point from the alcohol and extensive meth use so I was severely paranoid that the cops were after me.  It was strange, to me every person at the bus station was an undercover DEA agent spying on me, ready to pounce.  When I look back on this part of my life I kind of get a kick out of myself because I kept looking for bulges on their ankles.  

My sister and her husband picked me up at the bus station and drove me home where I’ve been ever since.  Back living in my hometown with my parents and occasionally winding up in jail.

Well I’m glad that I am finally trying to get my life back on track.  I’ve tried to stop drinking, stopping for periods of a few months then falling off, and I haven’t done meth since August 4 2018.  

Why I did this I don’t know.  It might be that I want someone to tell me that it’s not so bad and that I can still get my life back on track or that it has just been eating me up the entire time holding this big secret from my family.  They still think I was kicked out of the dorms for drinking and I have never told them that I was hooked on meth.

I’m glad that I’m in good health that I got myself tested for any diseases, I’m clean.  I just wish sometimes that I could go back to that day somehow and not buy those 4 25 oz cans and just chill in my dorm and watch Netflix.  It eats me up so much, thinking what could have been if I had just stayed in my dorm.  I wished I could go back to school.","I was a title IX violator in college. Don’t worry, I didn’t rape anyone.

19760,dwatv1,post,I made fun of a guy for being molested.,"Throwaway, obviously. 

I'm not saying this next part to make it look like some righteous indignation justice served shit, because it wasn't. I still feel incredibly bad about what I did. It was me being a stupid little angry teenager who really thought she was smart here, and it was wrong.

Vincent (of course, he went by 'Vinny') was my cousin's boyfriend's kid from a previous marriage, and he was in the year above me at school. He was just a real smarmy, bragging, narcissistic, cocky fuck. He was known for cheating on his girlfriends, using people for sex, constantly publically humilating people, acting up in class, just nasty shit like that. Your average sleazeball. He really really liked preening on me in particular, too. I mostly kept to myself, but he made a point of ALL OUR CONVERSATIONS (that I didn't want) being about who he'd slept with and how she looked, how great his grades were (wasn't that test soo easyy?), some story where he was a cunt or him 'easing' me.

That's it. Most of the time I would just nod along or say I had to go. Didn't even make an effort to get a word in edgeways. I called him an asshole once, and he just sort of laughed like I was joking and moved on. I'm not gonna lie, I was a bit of a pussy. I really should have told him to fuck off, but I just never did.

Anyway. One day I went to see my cousin's new house and the conversation sort of veered to him. I don't remember the exact conversation, but she basically told me his behaviour was putting a strain on her and her bf's relationship, and how he needed some kind of help but her boyfriend just wouldn't see it. She mentioned that he was raped and molested repeatedly by a neighbour of her boyfriend when he was a kid, and how her bf didn't find out for years until another kid reported him and the bf questioned Vincent. 

This is where I was really a nasty, smug little bitch. Instead of thinking ""oh that's sad, it's probably a coping mechanism for all the horrible shit he's been through"", even then I just thought of it as he deserved it for being mean. Revenge Ammo. A chink in the armour. 

So. We were on the bus maybe a few weeks later, and he was asking about how many guys I had been with so far. None, at the time (as opposed to him and all his giiirlzz that he wouldn't shut up about). He'd asked me this before. We'd had basically the exact same conversation. He said something about how I'd be fine, men have lower standards anyway usually, and then said he was just kidding. We sat in silence for a second. And then me, being the terrible, smug little girl that I was back then, decided to say something along the lines of ""how many guys have YOU fucked? Just the one weird old neighbour?"". He looked really shocked and confused, then really angry; to the point I thought he was gonna hit me for a second. I had really thought it would feel good to say, but it didn't even then. He just said he didn't know what I was on about, called me a weird bitch, and left. We didn't talk again. My sister broke up with her boyfriend not long after. 

Sorry, Vincent. I really am. I'd reach out to you, but I wouldn't want to reopen old wounds or anything. Maybe it'd be weird. We were both shitty kids, and I hope you're a better person now","I made fun of a guy for being molested. Throwaway, obviously.

And then me, being the terrible, smug little girl that I was back then, decided to say something along the lines of ""how many guys have YOU fucked? Just the one weird old neighbour?"". He looked really shocked and confused, then really angry; to the point I thought he was gonna hit me for a second. I had really thought it would feel good to say, but it didn't even then. He just said he didn't know what I was on about, called me a weird bitch, and left. We didn't talk again. My sister broke up with her boyfriend not long after. 

Sorry, Vincent. I really am. I'd reach out to you, but I wouldn't want to reopen old wounds or anything. Maybe it'd be weird.

19763,chxd30,post,I was scared of my depressed friend,"This is going to be a long story so strap in...

This girl I knew in high school went from being super popular to having me as her only friend almost overnight. She never asked to be friends... she just followed me everywhere I went. I thought that was rather odd and suspicious but I ignored it nevertheless and I eventually started trying to make conversation with her. One day I was scrolling through Instagram and I saw a recommended post of someone’s slit wrists and she was following the account which posted it. I asked her why she followed those sorts of accounts and she said that it’s because she felt depressed. As soon as we had that conversation, she began to text me almost every hour of the day and if I didn’t respond to her instantly she would say that she’d cut herself and say that nobody loved her. I was so worried about her to the point of where I wouldn’t sleep in order to respond to her messages in time. Our relationship was toxic. She additionally would send me strange, scary, handwritten poems e.g. about her killing herself or about someone being raped. It was terrifying. She even wrote about how she planned her own funeral and how she would die. She said that she would jump off of a cliff with me watching as she did it which genuinely made me cry. I had asked her to get help on multiple occasions but she refused every time. One day she called me and midway though our call my phone died and when I called back she was about to cut herself again just because my phone died. However, eventually I was so fed up of being sleep deprived and worried about her threats of suicide and cutting to the point of where I went to speak to a school councillor. I was told to focus on my own mental health for a while by sorting my sleeping schedule out etc. After I spoke to the councillor, a couple of days pass and she acts like nothing ever happened. She didn’t even look at me anymore. She turned from her lifeless self, to someone who is genuinely super energetic and happy. She tormented me with threats of suicide and cutting herself for an entire year and then she suddenly acts like it was nothing. I know for a full fact that she never got any professional help. Does that mean that It was all an act this whole time? I even found out that she’d threatened a few other people too with suicide and she blamed them for why she cut. She is the reason why I can’t take people’s mental health seriously anymore and I have serious trust issues because of this. I was scared of her.

19767,ccha7h,post,I lied about being raped.,"No no, not in the bad way. I didn’t make anything up, believe me it was very real.

I was raped the summer of 2018 and once my fiancé found out it tore him apart. It all came out by accident. I didn’t want to tell I’m in fear he would be upset with me (mostly due to past trauma, but that still doesn’t excuse me keeping it from him) Once he found out that it was his scout friend of 10+ years, he cut that person out of both of our lives so fast. I wanted to rebuild and start over. I know he was devastated about losing such a good friend. I feel so horrible for it happening. I feel like I took that friendship from him. 

And then it happened again. This time it was his best friend. His best friend raped and abused me for months....and then got me pregnant. I had a previous miscarriage and my fiancé and I were in no place mentally or financially to raise a child (much less one not his). I didn’t want you things to blow up again. 

So I kept it from him. I lied and hid everything. I didn’t want him to lose another friend. His best friend. When my fiancé eventually found out I was pregnant he was shocked because our sex life had not been very active and we were using contraceptives. Eventually he mentioned something passingly about “Man that’s just such a slim chance of that happening.” And I just responded “It happens”. I don’t know how but that statement alone made him go dead silent and then ask “Did something happen?” 

I didn’t know what to say. He was going to lose someone else because of me and I couldn’t let that happen. I tried to tell him I didn’t want to talk about, but he pressed (understandably) I watered it down really hard to the point that it was a ‘One time thing that was just a misunderstanding between me and his friend and I was too afraid to speak up.’ He still talks to this friend and invites him over because he really thinks it was a misunderstanding. I can’t stand to be around him, but love my fiancé more and don’t want him to lose anyone else especially because of me. I don’t want to rob him of the very few good relationships he has in his life. 


I want to tell the truth, but I want to keep him happy.

I was raped by my fiancé’s friend, my fiancé lost that friend because of it. I got raped a second time by his **best** friend and lied about it to keep it a secret so he wouldn’t lose more friends.","I lied about being raped. No no, not in the bad way.

19769,c7qp3d,post,My family doesn't know I was addicted to opioids for a year,"Backstory: This was during my sophomore year of high school and deals with my ex during that time. When we first started dating, it was cool, nothing bad and seemed to go smoothly. Later on she told me that she likes to smoke weed regularly which i was cool with since I smoke cigarettes occasionally. What she didnt tell me about was her drinking habits which came from her being raised in a broken home and her way of dealing with her depression. I wasnt okay with it but figured in time I'll do my best to help her. We live in dorms and there are usually a drug test once a month or every other month so i was concerned for her. The counsellor knows about me and my cigarettes since i was open about it with her but my ex didnt tell anything about her weed and drinking problems. This is kinda important since it led me to covering for her when she was drunk or high or both. This also led to many arguements and breaking up and getting back together after she promised to get better and to stop. 4 months down the line and someone in my dorm starts selling opioids. She begins experimenting with it and gets hooked. This was what our arguments were focused on and began the same cycle all over again: She's high off her mind, i try to convince her to stop when she's sober, we argue, she gives me a bruise or two, we cry, we break up, she comes back telling me she'll quit, I accept her back and all over again it happens. It later got to the point where she was high all day everyday and me begging her to stop since the chance of her overdosing was increasing. She began talking to other guys and flirting for extra cash for more opioids which hurt badly since each of mt relationships before and after this ending in me gettimg cheated on. She knew this but still did it anyway while telling me she loves me and promising to quit. It got to the point where I felt like i should try it to see if that will help me with all these feelings of betrayal and heart break. Next thing i knew, i was hooked, but the more i used it, the more my ex scolded me for doing it and slowly stoped using. It got to where i spent all my money and stealing from others to get more. My ex then told me she found someone else and that person happened to be my best friend/roommate, who she had tried to kiss on multiple occasions in the past. It left me heartbroken and drove me to use more and more which led to a higher and higher chance of overdosing, which i began to want. When I was high, I felt like i was on top of the world, but when i was sober, i felt like the smallest piece of trash that no one wanted or cared for. I began cutting again (I used to a lot growing up but stopped) and tried to commit suicide twice. The more i got high, the more I forgot about the stress from school, my broken heart, and the people leaving me.The thing that made me see how much of a mess I became was when the dealer got busted and the dorm had the police search rooms with dogs. I was lucky because I hid mine extremely well since my friends would always take them and flush them. That day i found out how much money i really spent, how much things I stole, how much of my friends i hurt, and how much my family didnt know i was broken. After the police left, i flushed my stash and made my remaining friends to promise to not let me close to opioids and not let me give into my withdrawals. I still cut myself and cried myself to sleep every night knowing I can't fix what me and my ex had, realizing how abusive and manipulative the relationship was on her part. I fixed myself and brought up my failing grades to a little pass passing, I paid back most of the people i stole from, and stopped cutting. 
I went into junior year a little stronger and more confident since I beat the withdrawals. That doesn't mean i didnt have problems that year too, becoming bulimic and getting cheated on more by future relationships, but those are stories for another time. I did get offered a lot of opioids 3 weeks before finishing junior year by my friend whom the dealer gave all his remaining opioids to to hide it from the police (he was in enough trouble from all the weed and alcohol he had on him). I am happy and proud of myself that I declined, despite how desperetly I wanted to say yes. 
Im going into senior year now a year clean from drugs and self harm, except cigarettes, i do still smoke them from time to time when im stressed. And yes, this was all kept from my family and I intend to keep it that way. This was all kept secret too in the dorm since I didnt act out or reveal my addiction or my stash.

Edit: My ex told everyone I raped her after I got clean too so that was something i had to deal with this past year too. She left soon after she said that but I got most people to believe me instead of her. She was horrible to me but i still sympathise with her since her home life was terrible. There is still the rumor about me forcing her into sex floating around but since people know we didnt have sex, it gets thrown out really quickly.","My family doesn't know I was addicted to opioids for a year Backstory: This was during my sophomore year of high school and deals with my ex during that time.

After the police left, i flushed my stash and made my remaining friends to promise to not let me close to opioids and not let me give into my withdrawals. I still cut myself and cried myself to sleep every night knowing I can't fix what me and my ex had, realizing how abusive and manipulative the relationship was on her part. I fixed myself and brought up my failing grades to a little pass passing, I paid back most of the people i stole from, and stopped cutting. 
I went into junior year a little stronger and more confident since I beat the withdrawals. That doesn't mean i didnt have problems that year too, becoming bulimic and getting cheated on more by future relationships, but those are stories for another time. I did get offered a lot of opioids 3 weeks before finishing junior year by my friend whom the dealer gave all his remaining opioids to to hide it from the police (he was in enough trouble from all the weed and alcohol he had on him). I am happy and proud of myself that I declined, despite how desperetly I wanted to say yes. 
Im going into senior year now a year clean from drugs and self harm, except cigarettes, i do still smoke them from time to time when im stressed. And yes, this was all kept from my family and I intend to keep it that way. This was all kept secret too in the dorm since I didnt act out or reveal my addiction or my stash.

Edit: My ex told everyone I raped her after I got clean too so that was something i had to deal with this past year too. She left soon after she said that but I got most people to believe me instead of her. She was horrible to me but i still sympathise with her since her home life was terrible. There is still the rumor about me forcing her into sex floating around but since people know we didnt have sex, it gets thrown out really quickly.",17,1.0,2019-07-01 9:58,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/c7qp3d/my_family_doesnt_know_i_was_addicted_to_opioids/,Neutral

19771,c03qg4,post,I got my mother's ex partner thrown in jail for a lie,"

 This will be long. This was years ago, and I don't care how I'm judged for this. If given the chance I would do it again a thousand times over. 

I'm 25 right now . When I was 4 my mother and father split . My mother is a horrible women. My father moved to Australia from New Zealand, got a job and a place in a few months, called my mum to tell her he would almost have everything ready for us to move over. He sent her over around 10,000 to pay the rest of the house we owned in NZ off so we could rent it out and use it as a source of income. My mother being the fucked up person she is, took the money , abandoned the house and ran away with us without telling my father . 

This fucked up our entire life, about a year after my dad finally managed to find her (he had to fly to NZ and hunt her down through family) My dad was so foolishly in love with my mother , he actually wanted to give her a chance . She declined and he sat us all down and asked us who we wanted to stay with as him and mum are split now . My siblings almost immediately opted to go with him if I wasn't so young and stupid I would have too but instead apparently, I was also foolish and felt sorry for mum so I said I wanted to stay with her. Biggest mistake of my life. My father had to pay my mum to take my siblings, this was a terrible idea. Mum was a drug addict, alcoholic dead beat. 

Fast forward about 4 years when I'm 9. I had the most fucked up childhood. Every day, parties , junkies and some new guy my mother was sleeping with or getting beaten almost to death by. She had been seeing the guy for about 3 or so months, let's call him Dirtbag. At the time I was young and naive, I really loved my mother but I hated the life she dragged me through. The abuse from strangers and junkies leaving all their needles and shit around. The stupid parties where random people would literally be having sex in my room while I was trying to sleep for school. Real messed up. 

After the police had gotten involved in an incident that put my mother in intensive care, my mother didn't want to press charges and still wanted to be with him !? He literally beat her within an inch of her life , and she still wanted to go back ? I don't know what happened. I felt dead inside. After all this, she still wanted to be a fucking bum ? It was at this point I saw my mother for who she really was. I had enough. I wasn't even 10 and I'd been exposed to the world in a way no child should be. 

So that day they sent me home , he was released and came back home. Now at the very least all he did was ignore me, but I think that was mainly because he was high on heroin. Once I knew he had just finished shooting up and would be down for an hour or so , I don't know what came over me. I wanted him to pay. Pay for my mother, for my life . I don't know I was just angry . So I planned and I knew what I was going to do to get my revenge ! 

Once he was down , I grabbed a club we had outside , and started to beat myself with it. To the point where I was really messed up I'd busted my nose , cut my lip , gave myself a swollen eye that came out of my face. I snapped the broomstick on my leg and managed to fracture my ankle. With blood pouring out of my nose and my face , I walked inside , placed the club and stick inside near him , but I was not finished there. This is the hardest part for me to admit because it's hard to come to terms with how far I was willing to go to get my revenge. I went to the bathroom , took my mum's deodorant, dropped my drawers and I'm sure you guys can imagine what I did next to the point where I bled. I limped downstairs , put the can near him as well. 

I waited around 10 minutes than called police, acted hysterical and told them I had been beaten and raped by my mother's parter who just got let go for beating my mother. In a matter of minutes and I mean minutes, police had swarmed the place, arrested him and we're taking me with them to the station. I had to tell them what had happened , so I made it all up . I told them after coming home and doing drugs he decided he would take his frustration out on me , beat me , put the spray can in me, and beat me more . The police were horrified . 

My dad was called and he flew over immediately. I'm not too sure what happened next a lot of it is a blur. But I ended up leaving the country with my dad, Dirtbag ended up in prison and I found out a year later he got served with a 32 year sentence. My mother got a 4 year sentence for neglect and child abuse since the police wanted to prosecute her for having left me in his care while she knew he was a drug addict and violent. The police barely dug, I don't know if thats because I was a kid and they just believed everything I said but it was really not hard to convince everyone he needed to go to jail. 

Until this day no one knows this except for my dad who I admitted it to when he came and got me from NZ . He said to me ""son I'm so sorry I didn't take you with me I wanted to give you the choice, but no matter what , you must never EVER tell anyone else this ok""? To this day it's our secret 😁 And just for clarification I'm male.. no it wasn't pleasant to do.

Edit: wow this blew up I didn't think it would. Thanks for all the support and shit . But to be honest , I don't think what I did was good and I'm not trying to justify it. And what I meant about doing it over again 1000 times , was in context to my age and mind set at the time I really didn't think it was going to go that way I thought at the time , the police would just take him away and make him stay away . I was a stupid little kid lol I didn't know better. But If I went back , due to my immaturity and mental damage I suffered from the way I was raised , I probably would make the same mistake... I'm not saying what I did was good it was just what happened","I got my mother's ex partner thrown in jail for a lie

TLDR at the bottom.

I (27 m) doubt that I’m truly heartless or anything, (movies and shows make me cry on a regular basis) but I’m able to compartmentalize things to an extreme degree. Writing this all out and facing how dangerously deluded I was has left me sick to my stomach and exhausted. I’ve had new insights in this process, however, and it’s about time I get it all off of my chest. 
 
In my sophomore year of high school I had been feeling agitated, restless, bored, and generally teen-boy-angsty all fall and winter. I’m not sure where I got the idea, but I started thinking about how arson is pretty easy to get away with. It would be simpler than stealing, which I’d done plenty of. No security cameras, no sales associates, no sleight of hand required. If I just found some abandoned, unwanted place, I could blow off a lot of steam and destroy something big with little risk of consequences.

On spring break, my family left me behind on a weekend trip since I’m the eldest of 4 kids and they knew I’d appreciate the alone time. It was the opportunity I’d been waiting for to get up extremely early and avoid passerby’s.  I had breakfast at 4am, disguised myself, and left on foot while the sky was still dim blue. For spring in the Pacific Northwest, it had been unusually dry for weeks.

The chosen structure was a little ranch house in the middle of a wide field, right between my suburb and some woods. 
When I’d first explored it years prior, the carpets, walls, and furniture were nearly untouched. Now, as I entered it for the final time, whole interior walls were missing, all of the windows shattered, and human and rodent feces mingled in corners. I crossed the creaky threshold then froze.
“Hey.”
A male voice, somewhat distant or muffled. Maybe the wind carried it from a ways away? I listened for any more sounds or movement. Nothing. I proceeded into the living room and noticed something I’d never seen in the house before. A clean empty sleeping bag in the center of the floor.

It’s more than likely that “hey” came from just a few feet away. I think they heard my creaky footsteps and assumed I was the owner of that sleeping bag, returning from some early morning errand. When I didn’t reply to their greeting, they probably realized I was a stranger and went silent.

I wish I could say that it all sank in and I backed out then and there. I had tunnel vision, though. There was a clear set of actions in my mind and nothing that had yet happened stood in the way of them. 

I knew there could be one or even several people in the basement or the rooms down the hallway. I made up my mind however, that anything beyond the initial fire setting wasn’t really my responsibility. If somebody got hurt or even killed, that was in fate’s hands, not mine.

I double-checked that no one was hiding where they could have seen me, not bothering to look in the out-of-view rooms. All was clear. Even if the voice had come from somewhere inside the house, they wouldn’t be a witness. 
I reached in my pocket. Matches only. Accelerants leave residue and I wanted it to look accidental. I dragged the sleeping bag against exposed supporting beams in the center of the house and ignited it. It made perfect, airy tinder and the fire grew quickly. I hurried home.

Once the plume of smoke became obvious mid-morning, I walked back on the forest trail a few times and got to see the whole firefighting process. 
To be honest, I was having the time of my life. Firemen often came in to my summer job for lunch after training, since the station was right across the street. I was thrilled to joke and laugh with some of the same guys who probably fought my fire just a few days after it happened. Everything had gone perfectly. 

I checked the local news over and over again afterward, half expecting a “body found in basement of burned house” update and the beginning of a real investigation, but there was nothing beyond the first little report. Years went by and the statute of limitations period for the crime expired without incident. I continued being a kleptomaniac for a few years, but the phase ended and I’ve been pretty low-key and law-abiding for a while now. 

The unseen life that the “hey” came from barely crossed my mind until recently. 

Last fall I read about Christopher Duntsch, a surgeon who botched operations so badly that some argue he’s guilty of murder. I googled around curiously about how murder is defined so I could form my own opinion. My stomach dropped as I read certain bits. 

*”First-degree murder is most often thought of as an intentional killing done with premeditation. However, premeditation isn't the only way in which this offense is defined. Other ways the charge arises is with an allegation that:
    - The death resulted from extreme indifference on the defendant's part, or
    - The death occurred when defendant was committing the crime of robbery, rape, burglary, arson, or kidnapping.”* -some lawyer

The concept of “depraved heart murder” also stood out to me. It doesn’t really get applied to arson, but the logic of it sticks in my mind.

*”If the risk of death or bodily harm is great enough, ignoring it demonstrates a ""depraved indifference"" to human life and the resulting death is considered to have been committed with malice aforethought.”* -Wikipedia on murder

I’m not sure why reading a few paragraphs busted down the walls I’d built in my head to separate myself from the crime, but it did.
I left someone’s life up to chance, half expecting them to be trapped in a fiery basement as a result of my actions, and didn’t bat an eye. “Depraved indifference to human life” seems apt. 

Anyway I’m in therapy now. I’d been repressing all of these new insights and feelings for months until finally talking about it last session, so I’m only beginning to process it all. 

TLDR: As a teen, I set an abandoned but clearly squatter-inhabited building on fire, using a homeless person’s sleeping bag as tinder.

19773,bwzgxk,post,I sexually assaulted someone and I don't know how to feel,"When I was fifteen, I had a friend who was sixteen over quite often. After realizing one day that I was attracted to him I made several attempts to be physically close to him and he sometimes reciprocated, for example, I would sit down on the couch and he would put his legs under me before I sat down. One time I moved my leg between his and kept it there and when I said I had to leave he said he didn't want me to leave. Sometimes he would move away but sometimes he would reciprocate and try to touch me a lot. He sometimes got erections when looking at me but it wouldn't lead anywhere. Well after this kind of noncommittal touching/looks I decided one night to reach my hand down his pants. I didn't jerk him off but I just felt his ass. I honestly don't know what the fuck I was thinking. After this happened for about twenty minutes he asked me to stop and I did. I made a dumb excuse that I was asleep and just tried to pretend like it was an accident. We both never talked to each other about our physical closeness or if we had any feelings for each other and this whole thing lasted over six months. Also one night while we were sleeping next to each other, he got close to me and he put his waist next to mine and started moaning. 

&#x200B;

Anyways the other day I was driving with him in the car and he brought it up how I put my hand down his pants. Apparently he told my brother and said to my brother he thought he was raped. At that point I kind of froze and realized that maybe I was grossly misreading the signs he was giving me. I honestly thought that if he didn't move away when we got close he liked me and that it was okay. I just thought we were into each other and we were too scared to actually admit it to each other. He didn't move my hand immediately when I put it down his pants and I honestly just thought nothing of the whole situation for years. I thought the whole thing was mutual and wish that if he really was not interested then he could have just told me out right. I don't know why he would sometimes reciprocate, I honestly just thought we had something between us. I feel really fucking stupid for acting the way I did when I was fifteen. I'm wondering if in his mind I was frequently making him uncomfortable and crossing serious boundaries. In my mind I just thought we were messing around. I know now that consent needs to be spoken. Honestly I feel so fucking terrible about all of this and I am wondering if I am just a monster. Not only that I am considering jumping off a building sometime soon.","I sexually assaulted someone and I don't know how to feel When I was fifteen, I had a friend who was sixteen over quite often. After realizing one day that I was attracted to him I made several attempts to be physically close to him and he sometimes reciprocated, for example, I would sit down on the couch and he would put his legs under me before I sat down. One time I moved my leg between his and kept it there and when I said I had to leave he said he didn't want me to leave. Sometimes he would move away but sometimes he would reciprocate and try to touch me a lot. He sometimes got erections when looking at me but it wouldn't lead anywhere. Well after this kind of noncommittal touching/looks I decided one night to reach my hand down his pants. I didn't jerk him off but I just felt his ass. I honestly don't know what the fuck I was thinking. After this happened for about twenty minutes he asked me to stop and I did. I made a dumb excuse that I was asleep and just tried to pretend like it was an accident. We both never talked to each other about our physical closeness or if we had any feelings for each other and this whole thing lasted over six months. Also one night while we were sleeping next to each other, he got close to me and he put his waist next to mine and started moaning.

19775,btqkpv,post,I physically assaulted my best friend after I found out she lied about being raped.,"The title says it all, but I'll elaborate here with excruciating details. I don't seek sympathy, empathy, understanding, or anything of the sort. I seek objectivity and accountability. The facts are as follows: I befriended (and at some pointed dated) a chick who was at some point a friend's girlfriend. The way he stalked and creeped and everyone around her out was unsettling, and he comes to me to confess having sex with her and losing their virginity (I come from a conservative community where this is looked down upon, just to make it clear why this is relevant).

I go ""no big deal, unless it was a rape"", and move on with my life. At this point we're friends (I've been the dude's ""wingman"" for a while), and she tells me her version of the story: she was raped. By him. By my friend. To say I was shattered is an understatement. Now, I didn't believe her and drag his ass into tons of trouble, but to say his image in my head was damaged would be a fair assessment. I made the terrible mistake of dating her a month after her side of the story, rationalising it to myself by saying ""well, I'm not really under any obligation towards anyone at this point.""

 It didn't work out (duh), but we stayed best friends. A friendship that was rather rocky, mostly because I was an insecure piece of crap, but also because she had some decidedly damaging habits (emotionally unstable, gets into trouble that I'm later forced to help her out of, etc.). I made the unfortunate move of once throwing a very angry fit (nope, no physical assault here) because she was getting herself involved with a guy who later (as in, a few days after the fit) confessed that he just saw her as a skank (which is what I had already known, and tried to spare her, but she wouldn't listen to me). This detail is crucial because it marks the first time I do something out of anger (I screamed at the top of my lungs, and told her I'm not staying if she's planning on continuing to deal with that person). 

Fast forward a couple of months later, and she's now dating a crush of hers (I knew the guy, she wanted me to introduce her to him, I did so because hey, friends). Her boyfriend's the ""white knight"" type, and she tells him about the rape too, only now he's thinking of taking legal action (having believed her because I told him a similar story when he asked). I go ""oh well, this shit got serious, might as well give the guy one last chance to admit to his fuckups so at least when we drag his ass to court he doesn't deem it sudden."" I go to tell him (he's still an emotional mess after his breakup with her), and he's in a state of total shock. He tells me he needs some time alone, and then a few days later comes back with evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that this wasn't a rape (chats, images, voice calls. I know, not enough. It gets juicier later).

&#x200B;

I get angry. So angry, in fact, that I go to where she and her boyfriend are hanging out, and call her out (friendship was going downhill pretty fast here, we had two fights the week before. She gets sensitive, says something hurtful, I get angry, she shuts me out, then comes back and asks me to apologise). I tell her to tell me exactly what happened on that day, she tells me now's not the time, I tell her I'm done waiting (I've been asking her to speak for six months at that point), and then she goes in. I tell her if she goes in I'm escalating, she still chooses to go in (later on she said she went in to grab her purse so we can hang out. Of course). She goes in, and I call her boyfriend, seeing it fit to let the guy know this isn't a cut and dry case. She gets angry, telling me how I'm trying to ruin her image in the eyes of her boyfriend, and then storms off to CONFRONT THE GUY ALONE (I mean seriously, alone in a shady place with your rapist?). I sound off, swearing at the friend for hours (he takes it in like a champ), and then when I see her again she refuses to talk to me. Apparently I hurt her by not trusting her.

&#x200B;

The bit where I physically assaulted her is finally here. I meet her next day, because we have a project we're working on, and she's purposefully ignoring me. I fuck up here, majorly. I start annoying her, inconveniencing her and misplacing the stuff she needs for the project. She gets angry and gets up to leave, I block her way. She gets around me, but as she's leaving I snatch her phone out of her hand (physical assault charge #1). She punches me (to no avail) to get it back, but I tell her to punch me in the face if she wants it back. She refuses (because she isn't a crazed violent maniac), and leaves. I wanna stop her from leaving so we can talk, and so race to stand in front of her. She manages to get to the staircase, and in my attempt to race ahead of her I shoved her (she came in my way, I was running full speed, I shoved her out of my way). She staggered to the side, but her arm flailed out and she got bruised at her wrist. Hearing her wrist hit the wall, I stop, look at her, realise what I did, and leave.

&#x200B;

She calls the accused to confront and silence him one last time, but I have him record the conversation just in case anything she says can be used to prove she was lying. She admits to lying about rape to preserve her image, since he was ""telling his best friends he had sex"", and decided ruining him is okay if she's gonna preserve her image. She also admitted a couple of other weird lies and shit I'm not really holding against her.

&#x200B;

This all happened four months ago. Since then, I've been actively apologising and going out of my way trying to fix things, to have some closure, to pay my dues for what I did. Recently she came back into my life, and things have advanced very quickly and we're back to ""best friend"" status. She still reminds me of the physical assault, telling me ""not to do anything stupid again"" if I don't wanna lose her again. I admit, God I admit, I confess, I fucked up fucking bad. I mean, I physically assaulted her. Good God. But, at the same time, I don't believe I'm destined to spend the rest of my life shouldering the burden of that act. I'm willing to get apprehended and spend some jail time if it means I get a clear conscience and the ability to say ""that's in the past now, I don't have to look at it all the time."" I realise what I did was heinous, and should never be done again... but is that it, for me? I tried to apologise, to fix things, to repent, I even got help, both informal and professional. Does this moment in life have to haunt me for the rest of my life?","I physically assaulted my best friend after I found out she lied about being raped.

19776,btk3ky,post,I lied about being raped and I feel like a monster,"When I was 12, I was part of a sports team. It was separated into boys and girls teams, but we all practiced together. There was a guy on the boys team, he was a senior in high school. He was 18. He was very interested in me, and I was extremely overwhelmed by it. I was by no means a pretty girl, and he was in high school, and I was a 6th grader. He got my number and we began texting every day, just normal things.

&#x200B;

He eventually asked me to be his girlfriend and that he loved me, and I was so excited and I said yes. He told me that we had to keep it a secret though because his parents were really strict and they didn't let him date people. I wasn't allowed to talk to him at practice, because his parents might see us and find out that we were together. So we ended up only communicating through text. He asked me to send him naked photos of me, and I sent them because I really wanted him to like me, and he said that it was part of being in a relationship, especially for high schoolers.

&#x200B;

I sent him naked photos of me every day for about two months. Then he asked for my address and he drove to my house around 2 am, and parked on the street a little ways from my house. I snuck out to meet him in his car. This became a nightly occurrence. I felt so cool and rebellious, but then he would touch me, or ask me to touch him, and I didn't enjoy it at all, but I was so elated that this 18 year old boy was into me. I think I loved him. I still don't know. It never got to the point of any kind of real sexual acts, like oral or actual sex, but he would make me touch him and make me let him touch me. This went on for about 5 months until he left for college, and I wasn't allowed to have any kind of Facebook or anything, so eventually he stopped texting me and I was kind of heartbroken.

&#x200B;

It didn't hit me until I was 16 and my sister turned 12 that I realized something was really wrong about the whole situation. I started to get really angry and depressed and most of all so confused. Because I really did love him in a way and I didn't understand why I felt so horrible about it. I wanted to talk about it but I didn't know how and it was partly my fault and I just felt like I was going to die if I didn't tell anyone.

&#x200B;

I don't know why, but I told my best friend at the time that this guy had raped me. I made up this story about how it was out of the blue, and violent. It quickly got around school and people would ask me about it and I got addicted to the story, about being able to talk about my feelings while not admitting my own shame and my own responsibility.

&#x200B;

As I got older, I kept telling the same fake story, over and over. I almost started to believe it was true myself. But when I reached college, I just stopped talking about it completely. I don't tell people that fake story anymore and if it comes up, I try to change the subject.

&#x200B;

It haunts me. Every day I see news articles or posts by actual victims, and stuff about how false allegations ruin both the accused's lives, and also harm women who have actually been raped. I don't know what to do. I don't know how to come clean about this to anyone. I am so ashamed. I feel like a monster. I'm so glad that my lies had never impacted this guy in any way, so I'm okay with that, but otherwise, I feel like such a monster.

Edit: I'm not responding to comments because I'm really not looking to get any kind of validation. What I did was horrible. I know this.

I avoid watching the news for the reason being, that the news may report rape and murder incidents and it gets me really angry. I never get angry with anything else to be honest. People can trash talk me and I don't care...or lost care perhaps

I quit finishing criminal law and moved to a different practice, because the current state of my mind is warped and it conflicts with the principles of criminal law upheld.

But no matter how much I try to avoid it, the internal struggle that I have, seems to follow me. I had a discussion with one of my friends who used to be my classmate when I was taking criminal law. Before I go further, I'd like to point out that my family wanted to make the incident private, so when my classmates learned that my sister died, I just told them she got into an accident.

It was all neat discussions until it got to the point of discussing a criminal's human rights. I tried as much as I can to not say anything about it, but knowing I used to study with them I was still asked. I said I don't want to answer the question since its controversial. But I got really angry when he said that criminals deserved to live so that they can live their lives contemplating the wrong they did and try correcting it and becoming a better person. That everyone deserves a chance after all, he said.

I get his point, I really do. But my anger didn't. I retaliated condescendingly, ""Not if they committed rape, murder or both multiple times. They don't deserve to live. They must die."" They were stunned when I said it, thinking I might be joking but they saw the expression in my eyes that I was serious. After realizing what I said, I just went with it and said, ""Let me ask you, if the rapist or murderer is intent of raping or killing you, does your human rights gonna protect you when you're dead? Getting concerned on a criminal's human right when the criminal in fact did not care about the human rights of the person they violated against?""

For a while he was silent, but responded with ""A law is law that needs to be upheld with."" I understand where his coming from, specially if he had no idea what me and my family had gone through. But I was firm with what I said, that murderers and rapists who repeatedly commits these heinous acts are not human. They are monsters. They became monsters the moment they did not give a damn of the human rights of their victims.

I would like to be clear that my anger only resonates strongest to the criminals who are clearly guilty and has been convicted, and has been doing the same crimes to other people. Specially the ones who were caught in the act. It makes me wanna take them out on the spot since the deed is being done right in front of you.  

You can call me a psychopath or whatever. But for me, its better off killing these repeat rapists/murderers than letting them live for them to commit the crime again to another person. 

If I'm branded ""to be the same as them"" just for having this views then so be it. I even have fantasies of torturing the person who committed the crime just to alleviate the anger I feel sometimes when my mind drifts into the deepest darkest parts of my unconscious. 

I don't know, I only get angry with rapists and murderers but not with anything else. I have been dealing with this inner turmoil for these past 5 years that I can't even talk about within our family since they also don't want to talk about it. The criminal is still at large (yes our detainment facilities have flaws). I still keep myself abreast with the status of the case though with the police but the longer it gets, the bleaker the hope is for me and my family.

19779,bn6bou,post,"I, think, I raped my old roommate.","I had a roommate a couple years back, he's a nice enough guy. A little awkward, but friendly and had a good sense of humor. I was friends with his old roommate and couchsurfed with them until my friend moved out to go to college, so I offered to be the new roommate. 

It was a small apartment, technically one bedroom and a walk-in closet that could fit a small bed. The apartment wasn't furnished at the time, so there was no couch. We resorted to sharing beds when the three of us lived there. I would switch between my friends bed and the roommates bed every few nights. No biggie, despite it getting very hot in the summer.

Occassionally, I would wake up in the night to find my arm wrapped around whoever I was sharing a bed with. I'd remove myself and scoot to the other side of the bed. I was used to sleeping by myself, I thought, I probably just thought they were a pillow or blanket in my sleep. Whatever. No one mentioned anything in waking, so I thought I'd stopped or they just never caught it.

One evening, right as I was heading out with some friends, my friend and the roommate call me over. They announced a ""roomie meeting"", followed by the sentence ""You've been touching ___________ in his sleep.""

I was just dumbfounded, I felt my face get hot and I wanted to cry. They went on, saying how _________ would wake up with my hand in his pants, how I would grope him in his sleep and they went on and on. I guess the roommate told my friend everything that would happen, because they would both throw out things that I've done.

I was resigned to sleep on the floor for the rest of my days in that apartment, until I moved out. I tried as hard as I could to put this behind me and forget it, but recently that roommate has applied at the job I'm working at and everything came back to me, and I've become a mess of guilt and anxiety. This is the darkest secret I've carried with me and I'm terrified of it getting out there, I don't know what to do.

19780,bmrnbh,post,I accidentally falsely accused my friend of rape. He went to jail for 4 months for it before I realized it wasn't him.,"This was in the mid 90s, I was only 16, Alex was 18. He was in our friend group so to speak, and I didn't know him that well but we were friends. He was a bit of a hard partying crazy guy, he drank a ton and slept with a lot of girls. 

&#x200B;

The night of, I was at a party, and got \*way\* too drunk and just fell asleep on the couch. I vomited and was just completely out of it. The owner of the house let me just stay on the couch, and everyone else slept upstairs. Then, I woke up, and a guy was on top of me, I was facing downwards. I remember just not even fighting back because I was so weak and basically slipping in and out of consciousness, but I remember briefly seeing his face and it looked like Alex. I was wasted, and I was practically seeing double. He would occasionally sort of shove me into the couch whenever I would move a tiny bit. Then when he was finished, he got up and I saw his body and he was the same height/fit as Alex. He then left the house. I knew Alex was at the party but I didn't see him before I got drunk. I couldn't understand why he would do this to me, or if he just thought I wouldn't remember or say anything. I was so god damn embarrassed and ashamed, I didn't tell anyone the next morning what happened. 

&#x200B;

4 days later I broke down to my counselor about it, and they suggested I report it to the cops, which I was scared to do for a lot of reasons. I was afraid everyone would side with Alex, that nobody would believe me, and I hated the idea of everyone knowing that I got raped, it made me feel like some kind of sensitive victimized person. But I did report it, and I said it was Alex. I am not even going to go over the details of the trial, but it was a ridiculous trial which caused a huge amount of trauma to have to go through. There were times where I just wanted it to end and drop the charges but everyone around me was encouraging me to continue. Anyways, he went to jail. 

&#x200B;

A few months later, at school, I saw a guy in the hallway. I had seen this guy before once or twice when I was like a freshmen but never really thought anything about him that much, he was older so we never talked to him really. I go to a school with 2,500\~ kids, so it was pretty common to not see specific other kids at all throughout the entire 4 years there. But he looked exactly like the face I saw that night. He looked a lot like Alex, they both have thick beards and darkish skin and south asian features and were around the same height and build. I remember asking my friends who he was, and they said he was a senior. I was scared to ask if he was at the party that night, because they would know right away what I was talking about. So instead I just went right up to him and asked him if he was in my math class (obviously not, but I just needed any excuse to talk to him) and his face turned bright red and he stuttered and basically walked away with this petrified look on his face. This wasn't a normal 'shy boy talks to girl' look. At that point I was so petrified, both because I knew the trauma of the trial was about to come back to haunt me again, and because Alex was rotting away in a cell because of a probable mistake on my part. I remember crying because I didn't want to report it right away because I was scared, but also thinking that every day I don't report it is another day in which Alex is in jail. 

&#x200B;

I reported it, said that I think I made a mistake, and that there is another guy at the school who might have been him. Detectives asked around, found out he was at the party that night, he came very very late. Arrested him, got a confession out of him. It was him. He confessed quickly. 

&#x200B;

I remember being DESPISED by everyone in high school for this. I put Alex, the cool guy, in jail for something he didn't do. I regret this more than anything I have ever done. Alex was weird about it, because I know deep down he wish none of this happened but he kept telling me it was 'good' he went to jail because he got fit and went sober from it. I felt like that was an excuse to make me feel less bad. Even when I accused him he never blamed me, he always just thought I was mistaken and that this was all a misconception. I never understood how he could be so forgiving over this towards me, even if it was a mistake I still potentially ruined his life. We weren't friends after, but we had two major talks about it and he kept saying he wasn't mad. I still don't know if I believe him or not.","I accidentally falsely accused my friend of rape.

19781,blmtxb,post,my story of being narcissist and how I may have got someone killed,"so Ive done a large amount of nasty, vengeful things that im now coming to terms with. Ill start with some of my first memories. When I was really little I did little mean things talked trash about my fellow 5th graders and made fun of the disabled kids with the boys who most likely grew up to be druggies, at some kids party or something the mom was bringing around white milk. I hated white milk and when she went to pour me a glass I knocked over the glass and the jug of milk in protest, Stuff like that or another time when I explained to an unpopular kid in grade 6 why I had friends and he didn't. No one ever beat me in video games or board games because I would turntables and hold grudges against the winners, I told my parents I had no cousins after they beat me in monopoly. The last highlight ill name off is when my little brother was being bullied by some kids I joined the bullies and made fun of him, tied him to a rope and almost dragged him into the street.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Anyway time goes on we get to highschool and this is where drama got kicked up to 11. I would make fun of the tolkien weird kids still and disabled like I had always done, but I started preying on relationships. In elementary school we had no dating aside from like one kid who said he was dating some girl or something. So when all the kids started kissing, going out etcetera and I wasn't getting anything because my social skills suddenly begin to fall behind I jumped at the opportunity to weasle into people's business. I would tell people things that one person did or I saw someone do (all lies of course). This thrilled me greatly and I begin to go home and laugh/cry in bed while my parents screamed about some shit I forgot to clean. So as I said my social skills that got me through elementary school waned and I no longer had a position with the popular kids. But over time I found that being sweet ,silent and nice to all the adults got me pitty points with everyone. I so often got compliments on being the sweetest most shy girl in my classes. People saw me as someone to protect and I exploited this immediately. I was able to get in with the popular crowds by looking for protective leader types. People knew me and respected me and it felt great. Of course I didn't feel like I was letting out ""steam"" per say.

so I get older and am in grade 12 my last year and I figure out to my suprise girls interest me a lot more than boys do (not that teasing boys wasn't fun \[im a rather cute looking girl\]) I started...well..now that ive brought it up with people I know, what was basically stalking this girl to her locker every day and walking her to the bus. Looking back she was really uncomfortable and tried changing her route to get away from me which I found out and was upset about. I tried asking her ex how I could get with her and what he did to woo her. This made him mad (still unsure why) and I decided to scream at him when we were all hanging out one time saying she would never go back to him. I honestly didnt mean to yell, let alone say it out loud. They all looked shocked that such a shy, kind girl would outburst like that. anyway one day she tells me she has a boyfriend. Now you think I would have gone for the bf, but I didn't. I saw a new opportunity in a couple on the verge of breaking up. Now I did like this new girl from the couple so I figured I would ""turn her gay"" I used my cutey eyes to win over the boyfriends trust and then we talked about the juicy stuff like how he was having a hard time with her. I then made friends with his gf who I started telling all the little flaws the bf told me and making them sound like terrible truths. Eventually I started flirting with her and she bit back and held my hand in the hall one day, I went home after this and touched myself to the smell of her hand on mine. Moving on I get bored of this girl and the high of sneaking around the couple gave me chills (proceed to go home fantasize and laugh/cry while dad hits me or something). this went on for a month or 2 before they broke up, the bf actual almost found me out and he confronted me to which I shifted the blame onto some jock he hated and solved the problem (escaping after to the bathroom where is smiled and let out my jitters from almost being caught). So they break up and bf goes and gets drunk out of sadness with a group of friends and they all drank antifreeze and one girl died. First time I felt bad.

College roles around and I treat it like high school two electric boogaloo. meet a girl who I get to be friends with and told her roommate she was spreading lies that he raped her, she got kicked out and couldn't go to school anymore. That was the only substantial thing aside from stealing from friends houses. Eventually I get a huge bag of karma and I suddenly start getting horrible thoughts and into arguments that leave me so upset suicide seems like the answer. Being gay makes me think I should kill myself and I get diagnosed with a ton of mental illnesses. Over time through counseling and self help I start seeing how awful I could be and how being nice would be so much better for my life and others.

Over time through counseling and self help I start seeing how awful I could be and how being nice would be so much better for my life and others.

19782,bl6aml,post,The time I robbed a kid,"This was only 3 years ago , I was 13 and in 8th grade. At the time I had a girlfriend and we been together for about 8 months , One day we were just chillin at school together (at break) and one of my friends and this other kid approached me . My friend said wassup and so did the other kid I said wassup back to my friend and the other kid even tho I didnt like the other kid because he was a asshole. He was well known for being a dickhead  he always talked shit and was racist  he also socked one of my other  friends in the mouth and left him leaking. I didnt really understand why people would let him do that because this kid was actually smaller than most of the kids our age and was only about 70 pounds.  I just remembered me and my dudes was talking and this kid comes up talking about how he was gonna rape my girlfriend ,so  I  picked the kid up and started slamming him into the ground and started slamming his face into the ground. I did this repeatedly and it got to the point where he was just rolled up into a ball and crying . Obviously this was well deserved.  But I guess when the office asked him about the story he completely lied . Saying that I came up to him with a group of people and started  jumping him  which was a bigass lie cuz I was with my GF . The office called up my Girl and I and had us explain what happened  , she told the office that she didnt see anything [ trinna cover for me] And they called up my friend as well and he told the full story, they didnt believe him because he was a troublemaker and was in the office every day. I ended up getting suspended and not the kid who said he would rape my girlfriend  so that really pist me off because he just lied and I'm getting in trouble for it  
Now this may be messed up but I was mad at the fact he lied about everything 

But I knew every Wednesday that he would have to watch his little brother  I ended up finding out where he lived from another friend of mine.
So I went to the kids apartments and sat on his porch for about 5 mins and inside I can hear him talking , I tied up my hoodie and tried to open his front door but it was locked. I can hear him say "" hold on"" as I'm sure he thought I was his mother coming back  he opened the door wide and as soon as I seen him I tackled him into his house and started beating him , I got off him and searched the rooms because I was bouda Jack this kid and once I got Into his room I heard his mom screaming   She was screaming because her son was on the floor with his nose leaking and a busted lip I tried to hide under his bed but his mom came running down the hallways and idk how but she seen me . And starting screaming again  I ran full speed out of his room and out the house  and ran into a near by creek  
 
I never got caught up for it and I even seen him at school, but he wasn't telling anyone about what happened and he stopped bothering everyone  
And he never noticed it was me

My wife was a long term rape victim. It was happening to her for months. And as a child she was forced to live with them as they were her foster parents. Well as a 20 yr old women she still has a very bad issue of self esteem and confidence. And I was afraid of becoming my own abusive father that instead of loving her and caring for her I neglected, ignored, and mentally abused her. I didn’t cuddle her or buy her things and some nights I wouldn’t even say “I love you” to her because I was scared. I was scared that if I had her to close all my pain would go away. That everything that happened to me would be fine. And I wanted the pain. I wanted to feel justified for hurting. And I pushed her away. And I hurt her. She’s the love of my life. She makes me smile in my darkest of times. I love her with all my heart. I want her to come back home to me. She hasn’t officially called for a divorce but she’s on the breaking point where she doesn’t want to see me for a couple of days. I went home early from work and laid down at 10:30 pm and didn’t stop crying and praying until 1:57pm. And I cleaned up the house. I cleaned up as much as I could before work today and I want to be a better man for her. 

So to the gentleman and husbands of Reddit: If you are afraid of everything but her bring her close and embrace her. Fell the gentleness of her skin and love her

To the ladies: what I did was wrong. men shouldn’t be afraid to open up to their beloveds. And neither should you. If they have a hard time listening just talk to them some more and tell them what you want. 

I took my wife for granted and I’m so ashamed of myself. I hold my crying and rocking back and fourth praying that she returns. I haven’t eaten in over a day. And I’m so tired. But every time I close my eyes I see her leaving me. Leaving me for someone else and I can’t take it anymore. I want to be different for her I want to change. I love her so much and it hurts my heart for destroying hers. If somehow you ever read this I love you Sarah. I love you so much and I could never dream about doing that again to you


Edit: Earlier during lunch break (this happened today on 5/2/19) I asked if I could call her. She said yes and I immediately called her. As soon as she picked up I melted into tears and cried for 7 minutes. She told me she needs more time. But she loves me with all her heart. I’ve been cleaning the house for her so she can come home into a clean environment and I can just cuddle her. I really do love this women. She is the best thing that’s ever happened to me and I love her for it and every single second for the rest of my life I will never forget how I treated her. And everyday I will fight for her and bloody my fingers and break my bones to dust. She means everything to me. And I will not fail her again like this. 
 
I will no longer hold back my true feelings for her. And I will have more patience and care in my voice. I love her. 

Also since this is r/confession I will also confess why I feel like I don’t deserve this happiness as a little backstory. 

At the age of 8 or 10 there was this 12 yr old abused boy who he and I would occasionally... experiment. We basically 69’d and I didn’t have any clue what that meant. Looking back at it now was really cringy and disgusting. I didn’t do it for sexual pleasure (for myself I don’t know why he did it) I just did it because it’s something he and I did and I never liked being the bad person. 

And then due to it I guess my mind took that as being molested and so I went on and molested (not raped) my cousin who now has severe anxiety, bipolar, and voices in her head. 

I blame myself for I also regret doing that to her. I stopped after realizing what horrible things I really was doing to her. I also wasn’t doing this for sexual pleasure. More like control pleasure and I wanted to be experimental, because I’d always hear from my extremely sexual father these things and I wanted to know how adults feel

I blame myself for my cousins mental problems. Even though she grew up with a drunk father and abusive (physically) mother. I know I’ve caused some issues and I go to a really nice therapist who knows all of this and he says he respects that I stopped not because I was caught (I never was caught) but because it was a pitiful thing and I realized what I was doing. 

So I guess the cycle will forever repeat where I push, and push, and push until I pushed over the edge and then I stop completely. 

I don’t want to blame other people for my problems. I don’t want people to blame my dad for screaming and slamming things and punching holes in walls. I just want to be normal and love my wife.

Edit Edit: She left for 3 days and crashed on the couch of a married couples house. They kindly took care of her and watched her. She came back Saturday night and we are now doing a whole lot better.

19785,bju29g,post,I was sexually inappropriate with a friend while he slept.,"Before I start I just want to clarify that I used the term “sexually inappropriate” because it didn’t involve nudity, genitals, rape, etc., but I don’t know how else to describe it. 

I’ll keep it short. I grew up believing myself to be a straight male. In high school, I realized I was into men wen I began developing feelings for a classmate. I later came out to him (and told him I liked him), and though the feelings weren’t reciprocated (he’s straight) he was extremely supportive and helped me accept myself.

Fast forward a couple years, we had become very close friends. Though I was really happy being his friend, my feelings had never disappeared, and had in fact grown even deeper. Our class went on a school trip out of country and we stayed in a hotel. My friend and I shared a bed. Late at night I was trying to fall asleep when I rolled over and saw my friend snoring quietly, facing me. To this day I don’t know why I did this, I guess so I could pretend to know what it was like to be with him. I reached my arm over his shoulder and began cuddling with him, caressing his cheek, and playing with his hair, all while he slept. The sad part it is it felt so lovely holding someone, especially him, but I also knew it was wrong. After five minutes or so, I stopped, and that was it.

That was a few years ago now.  I haven’t done anything like that since. To this day, to some degree, it still haunts me. I feel awful about it. I try to believe that I would never have, and could never, do anything worse than that. I try to believe I’m not a monster who is capable of doing something truly terrible. But there’s a part of me that believes I must be a sick & twisted individual to have done what I did. He was an incredible friend and deserved so much better.","I was sexually inappropriate with a friend while he slept.

19788,bjcb7n,post,"I hate and fear men, I almost never hire them, I attack them if they are creeping me out, and I cannot control this","I'm changing specific details so that I don't get recognized.

&#x200B;

I hate men. I think I am a feminist,  I support all the women's rights, but I never really cared to read any feminist literature or attend any protest. I just never think about it, and I don't really think about any social justice. As for men, I hate them.

&#x200B;

I was abused, berated and humiliated by men since I can remember. Most of it happened in a semi-patriarchal country where I was born. It's not as bad for women as Saudi Arabia but not as good as the US and Europe. Basically, I think women there have the worst of two wolds. They are supposed to work as hard as men, but also the gender stereotypes are alive and flourishing —  women must cook, clean, be pretty and watch after children. You can easily meet an attractive, successful hard working mother of 2 who works full time, gets her kids from school, helps them study, cooks for her family and also looks after the house, while her husband is a gross stinky pathetic piece of cum who ears in best case scenario, as much as her, and sits in a tank top in front of the tv all day after work, drinking and scratching his balls, and from time to time entertains his patriarchal authority over his wife and kids. Trust me, it's everywhere in the country I was born. People from there will recognize what country I am talking about. That's how most families look like. Women are equal in terms of they must work to support the family, but in all other instances — it's patriarchy.

&#x200B;

My family was like that. My mom was working more and making more than my dad, but also carried the entire house on herself. He drank, which most of adult men do, sometimes he would yell at her and hit her. He would hit us too. When I was 12 I asked why wouldn't she divorce him, she said something like ""kids must have a family"" and ""what would I do without him"". I hated it. I hated that every asshole with balls is considered a man, and thought he deserves Angelina Jolie lookalike. Unfortunately, there are more women than men in the country, and also women are taught from young age that they are incomplete without a man. Any man. So, I started rejecting this concept from childhood. I started despising men back than. I hated that my brothers were never told to wash dishes. I hated my father began joking about my womanhood since I my period started.

&#x200B;

I grew up, went through hormonal turmoil during teenage years, and even softened up to male classmates, some of whom I had a crush on. That was until the worst night of my life, when I got drunk with friends for the first time, was raped by multiple guys, left outside on the street unconscious (it was early spring) and was found by two early workers who instead of helping me, calling the ambulance, dragged me to a abandoned building and raped me too. I remember everything, except for the moments when I was falling into sleep. I don't understand how some people forget what they do when they drink, I don't forget anything.

&#x200B;

So yeah, when people say ""not all men"", for me — it's all men. I know that ALL men are capable of doing what those horrible pieces of shit did to me. I heard what these ""men"" said during the trial, that they were honest, family men, but I was a skank, whore, laying with her legs wide open and her tights torn in the crotch area, they did something any men would do. The biggest misconception about rapists is that they are violent psychopaths. That's entirely untrue, that's a very dangerous belief to hold. Everyone, under certain circumstances, can be turned into a killer or rapist. Every fucking men is a potential rapist. There are no exceptions to that, except for men without balls or who are incapacitated. Yes, even you, a man reading this, with a certain amount of shit in your life, with a certain amount of pushing you to the edge, even you can get into a mode when you are a raging and aggressive beast in a desperate need to execute your sexual power over a victim. Even women can become that, but they are hundred times less likely to.

&#x200B;

Then, guess what, 2 of those guys were acquitted, 1 went to a juvenile prison for less than a year, and those two workers got 3 years each. Amazing, justice served. It all happened in the 90s, so those two who got prison time, were more likely to have been prison raped, and I was genuinely happy thinking about that at that time. Another consolation is that one of the younger guys, who got acquitted, was brutally murdered due to some street related issue, I know because he lived in the same district as me.

&#x200B;

I don't want to speak about the amount of shame and hate I got due to that court process, or how my father reminded of my impurity until I moved out, or how all the people I interacted with, knew what happened to me and treated me with disgust or disdain. Of course, we couldn't afford to move, and my parents didn't really want to. Some attitudes towards me were even for the better. Father never hit me after that, but he preferred to not speak to me at all, he didn't even look at me. Brothers followed his example. sometimes joking about killing the guys who did it. I wish they were men and went on with it, but they were cowards, like all males are. They just talk a lot, and when it comes to actually physically damaging a person who isn't a woman or child, and therefore can fight back, they just pussy out. Even my mom treated me as if I had cancer, as if she lost her daughter. I had no support left from anyone. Some classmates would bully me and call me names behind my back, but mostly everyone stayed away. After a while, I thought it wasn't that bad. It was lonely, but at least I was left alone.

&#x200B;

So I got into studying, and was accepted into a medical school. I studied well and in my later years, applied for an internship abroad program, and moved to a Western country. At first, I contacted my family every now and then, but when they found out how much I'm paid, began to ask for money, and I stopped talking to them.

&#x200B;

Now, I'm a successful professional, living something that resembles the dreams I had, when I was little and was watching American movies and tv shows. Things like going to a cafe and ordering a cup of coffee, paying for a cab, living in my own beautiful apartment, wearing a little leather purse and paying a lot of money for someone to style my hair once a month — all these things seemed like a paradise back then, and now I have them all.

&#x200B;

I have a great job where I manage a not very big amount of people, I have great hobbies, I have female friends and all the pets I always wanted. But I never had sex and I never wanted to have sex, I never masturbated, I am never horny. I am disgusted by male's body, I can look at naked men without disgust only when they are patients at work, or dead. I hate being touched or when they flirt with me. Several times, I physically attacked men after they ignored my first ""leave me alone"". And in my head, I realize they weren't rapists or even bad people, just guys who had to much to drink, or too confident, or just ignored women's ""no"" because that's the environment they grew up in. Most women would just leave, or complain, or tell him to fuck off. But I can't. I enter the fight mode.

&#x200B;

I carry a pepper sprain, a whistle and a knife all the time.  Two times I hit men on the balls, one was hospitalized. I can't stand men touching me. When I was raped, I didn't fight back, and I carry the guilt all my life. Now, I fight, even where there is no reason to, and since I am a woman, and physically weaker, despite my self defence training I've been doing for over a decade, I need to hit once and hit hard, so that the man doesn't get up. One guy tried to sue me once, but it didn't go anywhere.

&#x200B;

I understand that I'll be alone forever. I am not a lesbian, but I don't crave interaction with men. I have a huge hole in my soul that cannot be filled with anything. I lack human touch so I cuddle with my pets. I go to therapy and it helped to communicate with men normally at work, but in personal life, I can't stand them. I warned my co-workers and friends about it, but there were a few cases when it cost me friendship. I organized my life in a way that I stay away from them. When I have to interact, like with a bus driver, or a cashier, I am neutral, but inside I am always dense and ready for something to happen.

&#x200B;

I also talk to potential employers and have a say if they are hired, and I almost never hire men. I know it's discrimination, but I'd prefer to say there were no candidates, than hiring a man. I had a few situations of getting extremely uncomfortable and that affects my work environment, and that's what I explained to the management when they questioned my gender disparity. They said fine, that I can hire whoever I want as long as the work is done, and I know that I cannot work normally if a man even accidentally touches me, or stands too close, or innocently flirts with me or with some other woman in front of me, or even speaks about anything remotely related to his sex life.  I also can't stand most movies. This is the most upsetting thing ever because I recognize they are good or great but when it comes to anything sex related, I feel gross, vulnerable, and alone, the same way I felt that night.

&#x200B;

I wish I was different, I wish I didn't hate men. I don't want all of them to die but I am never sad if a man dies. I try to control my thoughts, but it's like a parasite, and when I hear about even a male child dying, al I can think of is ""great, a potential rapist died"".  Therapy helps, but I guess I started it too late in life. I wish I was normal, but I'm not, and I hate men.","I hate and fear men, I almost never hire them, I attack them if they are creeping me out, and I cannot control this I'm changing specific details so that I don't get recognized.

&#x200B;

I hate men. I think I am a feminist,  I support all the women's rights, but I never really cared to read any feminist literature or attend any protest. I just never think about it, and I don't really think about any social justice. As for men, I hate them.

&#x200B;

I was abused, berated and humiliated by men since I can remember. Most of it happened in a semi-patriarchal country where I was born. It's not as bad for women as Saudi Arabia but not as good as the US and Europe. Basically, I think women there have the worst of two wolds. They are supposed to work as hard as men, but also the gender stereotypes are alive and flourishing —  women must cook, clean, be pretty and watch after children. You can easily meet an attractive, successful hard working mother of 2 who works full time, gets her kids from school, helps them study, cooks for her family and also looks after the house, while her husband is a gross stinky pathetic piece of cum who ears in best case scenario, as much as her, and sits in a tank top in front of the tv all day after work, drinking and scratching his balls, and from time to time entertains his patriarchal authority over his wife and kids. Trust me, it's everywhere in the country I was born. People from there will recognize what country I am talking about. That's how most families look like. Women are equal in terms of they must work to support the family, but in all other instances — it's patriarchy.

&#x200B;

My family was like that. My mom was working more and making more than my dad, but also carried the entire house on herself. He drank, which most of adult men do, sometimes he would yell at her and hit her. He would hit us too.

19789,bi6bzr,post,I ditched a girl at a party and the worst case scenario happened,"So throwaway account. Saw a recent post about what this sub was for, i.e. ""running over a 4 year old"", etc. and this came to mind.

So this happened about 10 years ago when I was in high school, just got my driver's license, and Facebook was just gaining steam. I'm a guy who at the time I was really into that weird emo look girls did. I met this girl on FB who had  bright blue-dyed hair and the whole 9 yards. I lived in a small country town in the midwest and so there were often crazy parties out in the boondocks where anything could happen without much risk of the police getting involved because of a noise complaint. Also, at the time (especially in high school) I was notorious for getting drunk at parties and wanting to ""sleep in the comfort of my own bed"", so I would always drive home, not giving a shit about anything else. Well put all of these details together, and you get that I invited this blue-haired girl I just met over FB to a middle-of-nowhere party. I knew the host pretty well, he was a few years older than me, but there were always lots of people I didn't know. But that was sure better than not knowing absolutely ANYONE there, like Ms. Blue. So later in the night, as was tradition, I peaced out -- I ditched that girl there and didn't look back. It was the next morning when I got woken up my a phone call from her telling me that she really needed to talk. She was sobbing. But the 10 years ago me had a very cold and self-centered heart. I ignored her and went back to sleep until around noon or so where I called her back. That was when she told me that she was raped -- by two guys who lured her in her intoxicated state to a bedroom. They forced themselves on her. One of the guys was in my graduating class and a semi-friend of mine, the other I didn't know and don't remember. Soon after it happened, I would tell people this story, and I remember laughing about it and laughing at the shock on others' faces. I regret my behavior now, and the person I was, but it happened and there's no changing the past.

&#x200B;

TL;DR I took a stranger to a party, ditched her, and she was subsequently raped by two guys.","I ditched a girl at a party and the worst case scenario happened So throwaway account. Saw a recent post about what this sub was for, i.e. ""running over a 4 year old"", etc. and this came to mind.

I remember when this addiction began (or when i finally caved), I used to tell myself that ""these are all consenting adults"" and that the websites that I viewed these on where (relatively) mainstream porn websites so no one was really getting raped.

Do not let that cloud your judgement).Although I have never forced myself on anyone (which is nothing anyone can brag about) as I have always been reluctant to initiate anything as a result of this desire, even with my ex's (NOTE: none of this is anything to brag about).Regardless, I am at my most aroused when watching someone get forced upon and to be honest, the more I watch this kind of stuff, the more I hate myself for feeling so aroused by it. I tried watching stuff which features a more consensual act but I find that I can't really get aroused by that kind of content at all and always find myself watching stuff simulating scenarios without consent at the end of my search.

Where the fuck do I stand then, While I can say I strongly disagree with the first kind of people (the ones who feel some people should get raped), I still enjoy watching this kind of stuff. Will I start thinking like they do in future?

The one thing I fear more than anything in the world is the day I start to fantasise about this disgusting shit with people I come across in my life (especially the ones I care about). Is this how monsters are born?

I will admit, I have every intention of ending it all the moment there is any indication of this addiction getting worse. I don't want to be a monster and I don't want to develop into one. Regardless, I am a disgusting piece of shit and no one I care about knows.

19791,bhc3ig,post,"I once ""questionably"" raped a woman seven years ago.","Hello again.

&#x200B;

Back when I was 18 I was smoking pot with two bros and two chicks they dragged along.  I met this girl who was really cute, they were both sophomores in HS, and I could tell she really liked me.  I hit her up on messenger the next day and we decided to hang out.  

I picked her up in my parents old crappy car.  We got to my place and decided we would drink.  We ended up drinking brandy and chasing it with 4l0k0(before 4l0k0 was recalled and modified).  We were pretty drunk at this point and my friends texted me saying we'll smoke you out if we can smoke in your shed.  Awesome!

So my friends come over and they start rolling up 2 dubs worth of bud.  We go out into the shed and smoked.  Half way through smoking she sat down and just laid down.  We finished smoking and they told me they were heading out.  As they were leaving they said, ""have fun,"" and all you could hear on the ground was a slurry, ""Fuck you.""  I burst out into tears.

I helped her up and guided her inside to my room.  At this point the alcohol was beginning to take it's toll because everything was spinning and I decided to lay us down before either of us got sick.  Lights off one thing led to another.  We made out.  I told her to take off her shirt.  She did.  I asked her to take off her pants.  She did and we began fucking a lot.  I remember bits and pieces, no way could I recall every moment because it was in the dark and I was twisted.  I also came inside her not once, but kept going right after into a second orgasm.

The next morning we put our clothes back on and walked out the door with a pretty serious hangover.  I dropped her off and we just said bye, no hugs or kisses, and she left.  When I got home she sent me a message saying, ""did we have sex last night?""  In which I replied yeah lol you don't remember?  She replied No.  We didn't talk afterwards.  I was really disappointed because I actually liked her a lot.  She was beautiful and I could've seen myself actually dating someone like her.  She never talked to me again so I assumed she wasn't interested.  What had actually happened didn't cross my mind until I was a couple years older.

Fast forward four years.  I told one of my friends what happened and I told him the name of the girl.  He was shocked.  He's like, "" her? her? she's fucking hot dude.  She's a lesbian though.""  This completely shocked me.  I had actually turned her gay.  I began thinking more about that night.  I think I took her virginity and she didn't even remember.  I also think I may have gotten her pregnant and she possibility could have had an abortion on top of that.  Yeah.  If I were in her shoes I would probably have changed teams too.

So I decided to text her. I texted her it's (myname).  She was like oh, hey(dot).  I texted an apology letter as long this story to her.  She sent back an equally long response.  She said she appreciated what I had said and that this finally gave her the closure that she was looking for.  I told her that I would've loved to date her back than but I didn't think she liked me.

If you're reading this, I am sorry.","I once ""questionably"" raped a woman seven years ago. Hello again.

&#x200B;

Back when I was 18 I was smoking pot with two bros and two chicks they dragged along.  I met this girl who was really cute, they were both sophomores in HS, and I could tell she really liked me.  I hit her up on messenger the next day and we decided to hang out.  

I picked her up in my parents old crappy car.  We got to my place and decided we would drink.  We ended up drinking brandy and chasing it with 4l0k0(before 4l0k0 was recalled and modified).  We were pretty drunk at this point and my friends texted me saying we'll smoke you out if we can smoke in your shed.  Awesome!

So my friends come over and they start rolling up 2 dubs worth of bud.  We go out into the shed and smoked.  Half way through smoking she sat down and just laid down.  We finished smoking and they told me they were heading out.  As they were leaving they said, ""have fun,"" and all you could hear on the ground was a slurry, ""Fuck you.""  I burst out into tears.

I helped her up and guided her inside to my room.  At this point the alcohol was beginning to take it's toll because everything was spinning and I decided to lay us down before either of us got sick.  Lights off one thing led to another.  We made out.  I told her to take off her shirt.  She did.  I asked her to take off her pants.  She did and we began fucking a lot.  I remember bits and pieces, no way could I recall every moment because it was in the dark and I was twisted.  I also came inside her not once, but kept going right after into a second orgasm.

The next morning we put our clothes back on and walked out the door with a pretty serious hangover.  I dropped her off and we just said bye, no hugs or kisses, and she left.  When I got home she sent me a message saying, ""did we have sex last night?""  In which I replied yeah lol you don't remember?  She replied No.  We didn't talk afterwards.  I was really disappointed because I actually liked her a lot.  She was beautiful and I could've seen myself actually dating someone like her.  She never talked to me again so I assumed she wasn't interested.  What had actually happened didn't cross my mind until I was a couple years older.

Fast forward four years.  I told one of my friends what happened and I told him the name of the girl.  He was shocked.  He's like, "" her? her? she's fucking hot dude.  She's a lesbian though.""  This completely shocked me.  I had actually turned her gay.  I began thinking more about that night.  I think I took her virginity and she didn't even remember.  I also think I may have gotten her pregnant and she possibility could have had an abortion on top of that.  Yeah.  If I were in her shoes I would probably have changed teams too.

So I decided to text her. I texted her it's (myname).  She was like oh, hey(dot).  I texted an apology letter as long this story to her.  She sent back an equally long response.  She said she appreciated what I had said and that this finally gave her the closure that she was looking for.  I told her that I would've loved to date her back than but I didn't think she liked me.  We stopped talking after that conversation unfortunately.

19792,bfz3xf,post,"I have raped 2 people before, and I hate that I didn't understand or care about consent.","I have 2 separate instances of engaging in sexual acts with people who did not give me consent.

The first one was a girl I was dating at the time, and I was trying to get her to have sex with me, and she said ""no"". After I pressed, she gave in to the pressure I put on her, and we had sex. I then did something I will probably never forgive myself for: I blamed her for not telling me no twice.

The second was someone who I had previously dated, and I was having some troubles. They then helped me out, and we went back to my place and watched Netflix or something. I came onto them, and while they never explicitly said no, they didn't seem very much into it (which I honestly didn't think about until afterwards). I could go more into it, but I wouldn't want to reveal identities.

&#x200B;

I know now about what's wrong with what I did, and I have since come back into contact with one of these people, and the other, I have sent an apology to, though I'm not sure they've read it.

&#x200B;

Here's an important thing to remember: ALWAYS ASK FOR CONSENT. Anything other than an enthusiastic ""yes"" means stop. If they refuse, then respect that decision and leave them the fuck alone.

&#x200B;

The only reason I'm becoming a better person now is because I got lucky and happened to be around people who gave me what I needed to grow, instead of giving me the punishment I deserve. I know I deserve terrible punishment for these things, but I think I'm doing more good in the world from having been educated in how to be a better person, and I do my best to improve peoples' lives now.","I have raped 2 people before, and I hate that I didn't understand or care about consent.

19793,bepbe6,post,When I was younger I got somebody expelled from high school and arrested for blackmailing to tell my religious parents I was gay.,"When I was younger I was a really mean and angry. My dad used to beat me and I got beat up at school a lot. Made me wise up real fast. In that school you couldn't show any weakness because then you'd get beaten up and bullied worse. Part of me just functioned I guess on like auto pilot. I'd sometimes do bad things because I felt I had to and thinking back it was messed up, but it's a part of my past now.

I am gay, but nobody knew about it at the time. My family also don't know. They are extreme Catholics and if they were to ever find out about it they'd of disowned me I'm pretty sure. My dad would often say how much he hated gay people. It was something I never wanted him to know because he'd hate me and be ashamed if he ever knew.

I ended up having sex at the age of 14. It was with a man who worked at my high school. Yes i know it was wrong and messed up, I don't want to go into detail about that though. All that matters is that some kid I was in the same group as once snatched my phone and read my texts. He found out I was gay and started bullying me for it for months. He would tease it and shout it at me when people were around even though I told him to stop. He seemed to want to humiliate me with the information and I tried to explain about my parents to get him to stop, but instead he started blackmailing me saying he was going to tell my parents if I didn't do what he said.

He made me give him my xbox 360, wii and DS. He took all my video games, my bullfrog, I had to keep giving him money and do his homework for him. Whenever he wanted something he'd just use that information against me to blackmail me into doing whatever he wanted. He made my life into a living hell. He'd also make me say horrible things to people to make them cry or hate me. The worst thing he did was made me to ask out some ugly fat girl and the dump her immediately after kissing her. I did everything he said because I was so scared of my dad finding out. I even ended up deleting all my social medias and smashing my phone because he'd contact me and it'd make things worse having him messaging me outside of school. I felt like I couldn't tell anyone or get help, he had this one thing to completely hold against me for the rest of my life. At the time I even considered suicide because of him.

After a while I snapped. I plotted to get the kid expelled so I would never see him in school again. I got the man I had been sleeping with to give me $800. I then met with a friend's brother at the time who knew a drug dealer and bought as much cocaine as I physically could. I also bought some knives. I planted it all in that boys bag and when the sniffer dog came through our school they found it on him.

He was immediately expelled and couldn't speak to me outside of school anymore because I had no social medias or mobile for him to contact me through. He got put on some kind of programme for extremely badly behaved kids I think i heard. It was the most ruthless and calculated thing I think I've ever done. I found out later his house was searched and his father was involved with drugs, so it didn't help his case at all. The kid no doubt kept saying he didn't know where the stuff came from and I bet they just saw his druggie dad and didn't believe him.

I didn't feel a shred of guilt when it happened though. I thought he was an idiot for testing me so much and the moment I found out he was expelled I was actually so relieved. As I grew up and matured more I mellowed down a lot. I became kinder. I feel bad for what I did now looking back. I'm sure there was a better way of dealing with the situation than that, I just couldn't think of anything at the time and felt desperate to keep my secret from my family.

All my friends stopped talking to him when he was expelled. My parents never found out my secret. I have since moved away from my home town and family and although life isn't great I'm glad I've moved past such a terrible time in my life. Oh if you want to hear an update on the guy who was blackmailing me it turns out he went to prison for raping somebody so I don't feel as bad, but I still feel bad.","When I was younger I got somebody expelled from high school and arrested for blackmailing to tell my religious parents I was gay.

19794,beern2,post,"I’ve started regretting therapy and medications, even though they make me better.","My first relationship (if you can call it that at 14) was abusive in almost every way.

When I finally got out, I was depressed, self harming, drinking alone when my parents were out, barely eating and purging when I did eat.
This went on for nearly two years, in which time I tried to take my life 3 times.
No one ever found out, but I’d cleaned vomit and pills out my hair (and the bath) enough to realise things weren’t great. 

Tipping point came when I sat an AS exam with razor blades up my sleeve, cutting as I went. The test paper got blood on it. 
I went crying to a teacher straight after, arms bared.

The school took me on as boarding student, to keep a close eye on me, but not much happened in terms of therapy.
I improved a little just by eating properly, not drinking alcohol every night, having people around and getting some sleep each night, but I started having dissociative episodes.
I’d move, eat, talk, but with no control. Everything was through a lens, stuck in slow motion.

Fast forward 1-2years, I’m in uni, and finally getting medication.
No therapy, because of course not.

Cue abusive relationship 2. Nasty year long thing that remained problematic for about 6 months after breaking up, suicide threats, date rape attempts, etc.

Now, over the past 4-5 years, I’ve been through countless therapy cycles and had my medication scaled up and down. 

I feel like therapy might be making a difference. But in group therapy, hearing the things others have gone through, trying not to be triggered...trying to cope day to day, just even showering and eating...
I can’t cope with it.

I miss my dissociative states. They gave me peace from feelings, from stress, made me feel fuzzy.
I worry I’ll try and trigger them again.

TL;DR? I’ve had 2 abusive relationships from 14yrs old, 3 suicide attempts and an eating disorder. I 
suffer with C-PTSD & depression.

19795,bd9mca,post,I was in a nonsexual relationship with my aunts ex boyfriend- possible triggers guys.,"This wasnt that long ago. I didnt tell anyone everything but heres this group and there is no way they or anyone I know could see it. This will be long- It wasnt with bad intentions or anything. I thought I was in love. He thought he was too and maybe he was but. That's not how you love somebody. So it started out weird. We agreed to a nonsexual relationship until I was 18. He was 26. It was a hard time for me and I needed a place to stay so I was staying at his and his brothers place. My aunt had just moved out to right next door with his mom. - it's all wAck sorry- so she knew I was there but not the relationship part. Well she could see the way he would look at me. And called him out while at a party saying he was in love with her niece.. she knew something. But to this day she doesnt know that he raped me.. I cant talk to the cousin I raised because I just disappeared after the 2nd time he did it. I cleaned the house. Took care of his kid and knew enough to break that house apart. All I wanted was to be there and left alone. I didnt want it to be a problem. My family definitely thinks I'm a whore and if anything. She thinks it was consensual.  I can never see them again, as I'm not sure what I'd do in that situation. Ever since that experience I wasnt really okay. I would get with people who were closer to my age and try to fix them. Then id leave. I was never able to feel any pleasure from things normal people would. I've never felt okay in my own body.
  Until recently, I'm getting better, my new boyfriend is amazing. I can feel things people feel. I thought I would grow up asexual because of you know depression and anxiety for too long. I just wanted to post this. And I know what I did was wrong. Hate on me all you want, but the encouraging words are what makes the world go round.  Thanks for listening.","I was in a nonsexual relationship with my aunts ex boyfriend- possible triggers guys. This wasnt that long ago.

19798,b85kqf,post,When I was around 3 or 4 I enjoyed torturing and killing animals," 

I was homeschooled and when I was around 4 enjoying killing animals. We had chickens as well and I killed a baby chicken . I had enjoyed that I separated the baby chick from the mother and I had trapped it and left it to die. That kind of torture of emotion tearing them apart between chick and mother I enjoyed. I had also killed frogs and had them in barrel of water and I remember torturing them too but just killing them and smashing them even. In around 2015 I had abused my dog and terrorized it a lot when it pooped or peed because the responsibility of the dog was dropped on only me. Some of you will see me as a complete monster for this and I agree with you. There was abuse in my family I can't actually remember according to a sibling. I don't remember much but my house was always absolute chaos. I ended up spending most of my childhood being baby sat by videogames and not learning much. It was in a very rural area too so I really had no friends.

I feel like there is an off switch in my head for empathy, or rather that empathy is a choice a lot of the time. Over the years I eventually felt more and more numb like a robot. I was bullied a bit when I entered high school after quitting homeschooling. I became quite an outcast after a while but I am not terribly socially awkward now at least. I discovered porn and though it is abominable I have a rape fetish. I am not a rapist though as I would never ever commit real rape. In fact I have thought about killing and all the ways I would kill my bully which had raped my friend. If I ever see him again I really want revenge and real rapists make me furious and are rage fuel for me.

These are some traits I read online that I believe I have.

Mood enhancement (e.g., animal abuse is used to relieve boredom or depression).

Identification with the child's abuser (e.g., a victimized child may try to regain a sense of power by victimizing a more vulnerable animal).

"" Whenever a pup did something I didn't like I remember kicking it, dropping it from a high place and just hearing the pained whines somehow pleased my sadistic ass. "" especially this sentence as I clearly remember times where I would discipline animals when they didn't do something I wanted.

I think I am a monster. I am not normal and don't let my story trick you into feeling bad for me as I truly don't deserve much sympathy.","When I was around 3 or 4 I enjoyed torturing and killing animals  

I was homeschooled and when I was around 4 enjoying killing animals. We had chickens as well and I killed a baby chicken . I had enjoyed that I separated the baby chick from the mother and I had trapped it and left it to die. That kind of torture of emotion tearing them apart between chick and mother I enjoyed. I had also killed frogs and had them in barrel of water and I remember torturing them too but just killing them and smashing them even. In around 2015 I had abused my dog and terrorized it a lot when it pooped or peed because the responsibility of the dog was dropped on only me. Some of you will see me as a complete monster for this and I agree with you. There was abuse in my family I can't actually remember according to a sibling. I don't remember much but my house was always absolute chaos. I ended up spending most of my childhood being baby sat by videogames and not learning much. It was in a very rural area too so I really had no friends.

I feel like there is an off switch in my head for empathy, or rather that empathy is a choice a lot of the time. Over the years I eventually felt more and more numb like a robot. I was bullied a bit when I entered high school after quitting homeschooling. I became quite an outcast after a while but I am not terribly socially awkward now at least. I discovered porn and though it is abominable I have a rape fetish. I am not a rapist though as I would never ever commit real rape. In fact I have thought about killing and all the ways I would kill my bully which had raped my friend. If I ever see him again I really want revenge and real rapists make me furious and are rage fuel for me.

These are some traits I read online that I believe I have.

19799,b5lzcu,post,I lied about rape,"A little about me I was homeschooled for about 2 and a half years at that point and really wanted to experience high school because all of the movies I watched and was hoping the experience would be similar and I also was hoping it would help me get rid of my social anxiety and depression which cause me to stay Home all the time to avoid people, at this time I had no friends and when I started school nobody really noticed me and I felt alone and sad going to school which I only had to go half days at the time.

When I was 14 I met a man who was in his late 40s let’s call him Rick.

When I first met Rick he followed me when I was walking to school (which was a 30 min walk) claiming he thought I was his neighbours kid and offered me me a ride which I refused and he ended getting out of the car when I was in town and walking beside and started talking to me calling me beautiful and kind, I was a little scared and my anxiety was through the roof because this had never happened to me before and told him I had to go because I was gonna be late to school.

The 2nd time I was walking to the store and he seen me when I was walking pass the gas station he waved and then after I left the store drove beside me and asked me to get in the car at first I said no and then he asked me again which I said no again and then he asked me a third time which I just stood there staring at him nervously and stepped back but yet again he asked me again which I complied. 

He ended up driving me to a beach while we were driving he asked me a few questions like my age and I told him 14 which he replied oh I thought you were older and then he asked me about my family life I didn’t tell him to much. 

Once we got to the beach we got out the car and started walking and I was freaking out inside thinking he was gonna kill me which My whole body was shaking, he started kissing me on my lips and neck and I didn’t do or say anything I was just trying to look down because I was scared I never had this happen to me before and  he started touching me and moving my face back up after that we went back in his car and he started touching me up and putting his hands in my pants while I was in the passenger seat And asked me if I wanted more,I was still terrified but I nodded my head he tried to do it in the passenger seat but I was completely still and wasn’t moving so he took me to his house and we had sex at his house. 

A year later I felt awful throughout the year about the whole experience because I felt he took advantage of me and fell into a deeper depression and started hating him and myself for putting my Self in this situation and told my mom he raped me and she ended up making me go to the police and then I lied to them and my mom ended up talking all her friends and my grandma and I lied to them all, I feel awful and when the court date came I didn’t go which he didn’t end up getting convicted of anything and ended up just having a 2 year restraining order

19801,b3m9md,post,I sexually assaulted someone last night and it's eating me alive (long),"First off, I want to say that i'm not doing this to make myself feel better the point of this is to get suggestions on what I should do. Last night a group of friends and I went out to the bars. We ran into a group of girls (some were mutual friends others weren't). One of the girls who I did not know started talking, having a couple drinks and I thought that it was going well and that she was enjoying herself. At one point our group decides to all head over to a buddy of mine's house.

I got back to the house and her and I talked some more had a few more drinks. At this point I'm drunk (still making conscious decisions) and she from what I could tell is more around buzzed but I can't be sure. The night starts winding down and everyone is leaving but the girls she came with were staying the night with two of my friends so she decided she was going to sleep at the house too. She didn't choose to stay at the house with me she more or less didn't have a choice because of that, and this is where I look back and should have realized the situation. So now we're alone, from the signs that I thought she was giving me (physical contact, engaged in conversation, at one point she said she thought I was attractive), I decided to try and make my move and I went to kissed her on the lips. She didn't pull away from it but she also didn't exactly kiss me back, instead she kind of smiled and said ""i'm tired I'm going to lay down for the night"" and she did. I was discouraged but not angry in anyway, and I went and had a few more drinks.

At this point I'm pretty drunk I come back to the room she is laying on the couch and watching Netflix and I ask if its okay if I lay with her. She tells me ""yes"" but not enthusiastically but I couldn't tell that from the state of mind I was in (not and excuse). I lay down and we talk for a little bit while I was rubbing her back probably trying to see if it will get her in the mood. Well after a while we both end up falling asleep, I wake up probably less than 30mins later while she's still asleep and its like i'm almost out of my own body I started rubbing her thigh, in the back of my mind I knew it was wrong but I just couldn't stop. I just kept going taking another step next thing I knew I had my hand under her shirt and I was touching her breasts, she never woke up and I kept justifying it thinking in my head that she's can't really still be sleeping and if she wanted me to stop she would tell me, then in the next second I had my hand down her pants and I was trying to rub her vagina, this is when she made a twitch to close her legs but I don't know if that was her consciously doing so or just a movement she made in her sleep. I didn't go any further than that and I never initiated  sex or penetrated her but I know that this is definitely assault because there was no consent and she was sleeping I felt the regret and fear instantly. 

We woke up the next morning and she seemed to act like nothing happened which I know a lot of sexual assault victims do stuff like that out of fear or disbelief or I don't even know I've never been this situation before I tried to make small talk with her but I was scared to bring it up because I don't know if she knew what happened. She seems like a very nice girl and she didn't deserve what I did at all. I want to come clean but I don't know what to do, I'm in college and I have friends that have been assaulted and even raped and to think that I'm putting somebody else through what they went through is tearing my mind apart. What should I do I know I should come clean to her and talk about it but I don't know how to go about it. I haven't got out of bed all day and I know if this is how feel she feels even worse.

19803,b0ocrc,post,I [19F] lied about being raped to avoid talking about my sexual abuse to friends/family.,"Sorry this is long. So basically, when I was 5 years old I was sexually molested by someone close to me (non family). I was old enough that I remember fragments of it. When I was 5, I told my mom. She told me to never tell anyone and implied that it was shameful. So I didn’t and I also didn’t really think about it until I was 13. I had just started liking boys and all of sudden was remember/realizing what had really happened to me. It really fucked me up. I started to think about how my mom told me not to tell anyone but I was in so much pain that I really wanted people to listen and hear me. I lived in an a household with a depressed mom and a abusive father. 

I started having anxiety/panic attacks around the thought of sex and it was ruining my life at the time. This went on for a year, when one day, me and my sister were having a close moment when I blurted out that I was raped and needed help. I couldn’t talk about what had happened to me as a child, I had started to develop feelings of shame and disgust for my own body around this time and talking about it just felt embarrassing and miserable. 

So I told her that I was raped and she asked more questions. Instead of telling her the truth, I told her it happened a year ago by a stranger. She eventually asked more questions so I made up when it happened and the details of it. Having to create this situation in my head was incredibly painful and when I thought about it, it would bring me back to my trauma. I also started having flashbacks at this time and the flashbacks would range between what actually happened and then this false story. It became real to me, like something that had happened.

She put me in intensive therapy and we had to tell my mom why so I continued the lie. The therapy helped a lot with my trauma but still I continued to use my rape story as a way to work out my trauma with trusted adults and friends. 

Currently, I’m still in therapy. I was close to dropping out but I finished high school. I don’t talk about the rape anymore and have opened up about my real abuse to 1 or two people (but not the lie, which they believe happened as well). I’m finally able to get past my PTSD far enough to go school and hold a job. I am more positive and kind to myself and others and believe I am on a path to finally healing. But I feel terrible. Thinking about what I did. I can’t go back now and I don’t know what to do. I feel like I’ve ruined all my relationships to a point and I can’t tell the truth. Any advice would help on how to move forward. Thanks.

It got me into therapy and I have changed my life. Feel miserable about the lie, don’t know what to do.","I [19F] lied about being raped to avoid talking about my sexual abuse to friends/family.

19804,az825p,post,I was a bully to my ex's new girlfriend in highschool,"I dated a guy, Tim, off and on for about 4 years, and  he overall was bad for my self esteem. I want to give a little backstory and say that he was 3 years older than me and we started dating when I was 12 or 13 ( I know, YIKES. I'm 23 now and looking back I find this very inappropriate). He was my ""first love"".  He was a very narcissistic person and at times abusive. He wasn't loyal at all and maybe 3 years into our on again off again relationship I had found out that he'd been going after another girl, Cinthia. For whatever reason, this made me absolutely hate her. He cheated on me with her. Still, I hated her, not him. Even though he was the one that did that to me. I stupidly continued to date him for some time before I finally ended it for good. Tim promptly started dating her which wasn't a surprise.

I wish I could say that was the end of it. Unfortunately I still held a grudge against Cinthia, and I bullied her  on social media and talked negatively about her to my peers. Obviously,  she wasn't fond of me at all either, and she took it upon herself to talk negatively about me online and to peers as well. After maybe a year or so Tim had reached out to me and cheated on her with me. The driving reason behind it for me was to be petty to her. She had the same reaction to him being unfaithful as I did, she just blew up hating on me and continued to date Tim. I am writing about all of this now because I'm bored at work pretty much just sitting here on my phone and it's on my mind today and I found out from a highschool friend a few months ago that they got married last year.  

I do feel very bad about all the mean things I said to her and about her. I've gotten older, wiser, and more considerate since then but I still think about it all from time to time. 

I find it so ironic that both her and I just hated each other and saw one another as the enemy when in reality Tim was the one that hurt us and brought down our self esteem like that, not to mention the statutory rape considering he was 18 and both of us still minors.

 I was definitely a bully to her back then. I regret that very much so and looking back now I'm just wondering what the hell I was thinking back then. 
I know she still thinks of me as this evil crazy person and I can't help but feel sad about that, because neither of us ever really knew each other and she just labeled me crazy and evil. 

There is a lot more detail to this story but I'm not in the position to write a whole memoir on my phone. Thank you random internet stranger who wasted their time to read my dumb story

19805,axtp60,post,I pulled out my dick and put the girl’s hand on my dick....now idk if I can get in legal trouble.,"I’m mainly overthinking it and I annoyed the girl so much and treated her like shit that she’s blocked me and stopped responding for a while now. This happened in December and I’m 18 while she was 16 (Now 17). I asked her if she wanted to suck it and she said she couldn’t cause she had to go home soon. She said she really wanted to have sex with me but she never could find the time. Okay back to the main story. We were near a street and a very open lake next to some houses and we were covered by some bushes. She kinda just went along with what was going on and i asked if she wanted to touch my dick and she said sure. So I said “you ready” and she said “yea” so I pulled it out for 5 seconds she grabbed it then I put it back in my pants. Then we immediately said bye and we walked our separate ways home. While walking home I laughed and said “ ha stupid bitch” and went home in a good mood but when I got home I realized I could’ve gotten in trouble for something like that. I couldn’t believe what I did. She texted me saying that she really liked feeling it and that she really wanted to have sex. I was so desperate. (Btw what do you call it when you know you’ve made a big mistake but didn’t realize it before you did it?)She probably has forgotten about me by now or still misses me or something. She doesn’t know my real name or what high school I go to or where I live. But seeing all these stories of people coming out and saying they were raped is really scaring me and I feel so much guilt. I know this isn’t something on a scale of a 40 year old man and a 15 year old but I feel like it is for some reason. 

Btw I live in Texas and I think age of consent is 16 I’m not sure tho.","I pulled out my dick and put the girl’s hand on my dick....now idk if I can get in legal trouble.

19806,axia3h,post,"I raped the woman who helped me out of the closet, but stopped midway and apologized. I don't know how to make amends.","Listen here, I already know what I did was wrong. This woman had been there for me. I was raised strictly Christian, since I was young my mother has preached that gays will burn in hell. I took alot of shame growing up (bi) , but I remained closeted and in denial until recently.

Some background, I've known this woman for a little over a year. We originally met and dated, and everything we did was consensual. The relationship was fine, just we weren't for each other then. Ended it smoothly, still maintained friendship.

Come years' end, we got back together (hanging out) and I was thinking about coming out shit. She had dated women originally and she was cool with open relationships, so I felt safe talking with her. I had brought this stuff up back then, but I wasn't ready to act on it.

She and I had hungout alot over the next few months, we were in this weird relationship that wasn't Fwb's, but we fucked around with each other, made out and would grind on each other. This one time, she brought dildos and I experimented with her fucking me.

Fast forward, I had a one night stand with a dude, my choice, but I felt conflicted about the whole thing internally. You have to understand I was feeling conflicted*, half of me today still hates myself for coming out from shame.

First mistake, I had her hangout that night with me after he left. I noticed I was being aggressive with her, I didn't recognize that then, I wish I would've. I was being an asshole about stupid shit, talking like I understood what being a woman was about(gay sub). She looked at me and told me I didn't understand anything about what being a woman was like.

After that, the night was better, we laughed, talked about stuff, but I kept feeling random emotions. I was so happy to be out of the closet with her. Half of me was free after 15 years of hiding. My straight half was ashamed and angry though thinking back. They aren't integrated at all, so the mannerisms switch depending on which I express. I was completely my gay self that night with her. 

Then we went to sleep nude, cause that's just what we did. You know when you wake up in the middle of the night with a boner? Yeah that happened, but internally I felt pure rage towards the woman next to me, I was 4am self, groggy angry and I felt the need to assert my dominance. I wanted to have the power and control like how I felt when I was just straight. I wanted to take back my respect from the woman who tore it away from me. I wanted the shame to stop. 

God what an insecure idiot. 

Not that hard to aim a dick, I slid right in and began to start, then she said shit that woke me up from that fog. ""This is what you don't understand about being a woman"". Like holy shit how much more of a hypocrite could I be. It hit me there that up until that point I had seen sex as an expression of power. I stopped almost as soon as I started, but the damage was done. We went back to sleep, she had been somewhat typsy the last night so I explained to her what happened, I didn't cum in her, I didn't violently beat her, but I broke the trust between us completely.

She left after I explained. I got a text from her basically saying we need to reevaluate this relationship. I sent her a text where I straight up said, [Name], I raped you.. As the first line, so point blank I've admitted the crime. 

I apologized for breaking her trust and abusing her, I don't know what to do. She said she appreciated the remorse, but she still needed time to think and heal. And to please give her space. So I have. 

I'm guilty of this. But I'm still confused. She is to from the looks of the text. I don't think she wants me to go to prison, but at the same time I gave her the loaded gun. If she wants to fire it.. Well I'd deserve it at least partially. 

I've been reevaluating my life, the next night I let a guy come over and fuck me raw, but I still chose that, so it wasn't the same as being raped.

I feel horrible. I don't trust myself around anyone. I keep spending hours thinking about it. I feel selfish, I want to make it up to her, but I can't do a damn thing because I'm the cause of the pain.

I know it was wrong. If the police don't come knocking, I'll become a better man in the meantime. Let your damn kids be who they are please, I didn't plan for this to happen. It just did because of bullshit masculine validation I was convinced had more meaning to me than she did.

19807,awdu35,post,"I knew my brother was a serial rapist for years, and I never told anyone.","I am 2 years younger than my brother. He was always a popular guy at school, and I sort of always lived in his shadow. He was always sort of a 'bad boy' in that sense. He ran with a crew of trouble makers constantly, he drank and did drugs and partied constantly. He had a sort of roughed up face from getting into fights constantly, he had scars. He had bleached short hair and a leather jacket that he wore everywhere. 

My parents were gone one weekend and my brother threw a party, and later in the night I remember he went upstairs with a girl who seemed really fucked up and wasted. My bedroom is on the first floor, for reference, so when she came downstairs crying and saying ""get away from me, get away from me"", I heard that very clearly. He came downstairs and was yelling at her to come back into the bed. They got into an argument, and I remember her saying that she woke up to him on top of her, naked. 

That was the first incident, I was 15, he was 17. 

The second incident was during my first year of college. I lived in his apartment, we went to the same college. It was fun, finally living away from my parents, and I had a big nice apartment with my older brother and his cool older friends. Then, maybe 8 months into me living there, I overheard a discussion. One of the friends said that my brother had 'pushed a high school girl against a wall and raped her', and left her with bruises. My brother kept on denying it over and over again, and the friend said he had just heard it as a rumor, and he wasn't sure if my brother did it. Of course, the college assholes that they are, his friend was giving him 'tips' to avoid people hearing about the incident. 

Then another incident, brother had a few friends over. Girl got really drunk and asked to sleep on the couch. I woke up to her yelling ""get the fuck off of me!"" and then saying ""OWW! OW! OW! WHATS WRONG WITH YOU! STOP!"" and crying in pain, and then I heard her run out of the apartment. I just remember my brother saying ""fuck, fuck, fuck"" after she ran out. I don't know if the other roommates heard, they live further down the hall of our apartment. 

The worst however was the last incident. Once again, girls were over the apartment. Some of them high school girls. He had some weirdo guy over who I had never met. At this point, the roommate had left, so it was just me and my brother. Most of the girls had left, and two of them stayed. I remember one of them was stumbling over around the time I left. I left to get beer, and when I got back, I walked in on the girl passed out on the couch, with the strange guy next to her feeling her breasts up. I figured they roofied her. I didn't know where my brother was, but I thought this was weird, so I told him to stop and said he should leave. I remember my voice was trembling, I was so scared. He got up and acted all sorry (that I caught him, not that he did it). Except then my brother came out of the bathroom, butt naked. He was going to fuck her too. They both were. He awkwardly asked what I was doing back, I said I was just getting beer, and he said he thought I was going to Chris's house. After that it was just an awkward silence, and I just walked to my bedroom. And presumably, they raped her. And I didn't do anything because I was too petrified of calling on my older brother for this. 

Its been over a decade since then and I think about it all the time. My brother would go on to become a serious pill and alcohol addict soon after I moved out (well, dropped out. I dropped out of college). He is now in and out of jail and rehab. He went to jail for rape. I don't know if he had some serial fetish for raping girls, but he did it, over and over again. The same kind of shit, almost always sleeping girls. 

I still feel this constant lingering guilt about what happened. The fact that I let that happen, over and over again. That last incident is what truly makes my stomach churn. I could have stopped that, I really could have, but I just chose not to because I didn't want to shame my brother or anything. I didn't want to confront him because I was always so shy around him and never felt like I had the balls to do it. He was my brother, and I loved him, and I didn't want to get him in trouble. So I just never told anyone. 

When he finally got arrested for rape, I honestly let out a huge sigh of relief. Part of the guilt I had was relieved, but not all of it. It also oddly enough *confirmed* my feelings, that these were NOT one-off incidents, and that HE WAS a serial rapist. Every time it happened before, I would trick myself into think ""this is just the last time this is gonna happen, he was just horny"". Nope, he was a consistent pervert. 

I understand that in some ways, I am responsible for the rapes for not seeking help right away and saving the girls. I let them happen. Even though its been so long I still feel so horrible inside.

19808,avv6p7,post,I raped someone.,"This has been on my mind for ten years. Ten long fucking years.

I was raped at 19 and got pregnant. After preforming a self abortion in my college bathroom by myself at 3 am, I became a party girl. I had been a virgin. 

Once my partners hit the double digits, I started becoming wilder and wilder. I would pick up random men just to prove I could. One night with a bunch of friends, I saw another friend’s little brother and thought I’d like to sleep with him. We stood around and talked and we found out he had been drinking pretty heavily after a bad break up. I took him back to our apartment. He performed oral sex on me and vice versa. Once we finished, he asked “now what?” So I have him a condom. We had intercourse. Then he fell asleep. We woke up in the morning and went about our day.

A year later, he ended up dating my room mate. I had bragged he was a great lay. He then told her that he didn’t remember any of that night and apparently had a breakdown. I lost my shit and became so angry. I told her he was a dirty liar.

Ten years later, I hate myself. I raped a man. I had no idea he was that drunk that he wouldn’t remember. He was coherent and seemed mutually interested. But clearly I am just a piece of shit. 

Edit: Apparently the consensus is that I did not rape him. I never thought to question when he began telling everyone that I had raped him. People always asked me awful questions about my rape, so I assumed people grilled him the same way. It took me so long to even admit my rape was non consensual. I’ve carried this guilt around for so long and even more so since #metoo. I’m getting the impression he was just embarrassed to have slept with me which a) ouch. And b) own your actions. And c) he was even more of a dick weed than I originally thought. ","I raped someone. This has been on my mind for ten years. Ten long fucking years.

19809,ap7icx,post,I am not reporting a child rapist in fear of losing my family,"About 14 years ago, when I was 6, my uncle sexual assaulted me. I had reported what had happened to my mother and aunt but both chose to do nothing. In fact my mother told me to keep the incidence to myself, as if I had done something shameful. 

There are high numbers of rape cases in the country where I'm from and families often cover it up in fear of being shunned or losing their jobs. 

My family and I have moved away to US not too long afterwards and have been here since.  
Although it's been more than a decade, I still have moments where I have uncontrollable breakdowns in private knowing that there is a man out there who took advantage of my vulnerability and walked away free. There isn't a day that goes by where I don't feel crushed by guilt and fear that I may be letting this abuse happen to another child. 

The truth is, I am so used to my rape being minimized that I no longer have the trust to open up and confide in somebody. I feel trapped and alone. On the outside, I never miss the opportunity to meet new people and do whatever I can to help another person. I do well in school, take care of my health, volunteer and have lots of hobbies. I try to bring light to life and make people laugh and smile. My friends would describe me as an outgoing and creative person. At times, it feels like my past was just a fever dream. 

It as been years since my mother and I spoke of the incident and we have a good overall relationship. She is my mother and I have forgiven her, although I do not agree with her choices. 

I don't know how to go about reporting this to the police of the country where I'm from. They have a reputation for not taking old cases seriously, especially family ones. I also have no desire to open a Pandora's box of negativity. I want to move forward in my life and hope that someday I can forgive myself.

TL;DR
I was sexually assaulted as a child and my family never reported it to the police. The man just walked away free and it disgusts me knowing that he may be continuing to abuse other children. By going to the police, I risk having people know what my parents did and what happened to me. I do not want to give him any more power over my life than he has already taken and want to finally move on","I am not reporting a child rapist in fear of losing my family About 14 years ago, when I was 6, my uncle sexual assaulted me.

I do not want to give him any more power over my life than he has already taken and want to finally move on",13,7.0,2019-02-10 19:43,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/ap7icx/i_am_not_reporting_a_child_rapist_in_fear_of/,Neutral
19810,al5flw,post,"In 1999, I killed a man and his wife with a baseball bat, for abusing me as a child in the early 90s. I got 20 years in a mental institution."," I was born in 1983.

We moved into this neighborhood in 1989. There was this guy who had a family (a wife, and 2 children) that seemed pretty nice. However, we never really got to do anything with him. However, he would offer me soda and other drinks if I would go into his shed and look at her cars. The first time he sexually abused me was in 1993, when I was 10. He showed me his cars, then pushed me down, and then put his penis in my anus. At first I didn't know what was happening, and didn't think much until I realized he was raping me. He then hit me and said if I told his wife or anybody about it, he would kill me. He even pulled a gun in my face once. It was disgusting, I couldn't sleep at night. I was scared to tell anyone. I didn't want to be known as a person who was abused by a neighbor, and it went on for almost 2 years.

When I was turning 15 (1998), the full realization of what had happened hit me. I was raped as a child. I became depressing, and starting planning revenge. I had played baseball before, so we had some bats in the shed. I plotted to get revenge on him for ruining my life and relationships.

It was January 25th, 1999. It was after 5PM, and I grabbed a camcorder, and went out to the shed, and grabbed a baseball bat. I told my Mom was going to shovel his driveway (There was a snowstorm) , but I wasn't. I knocked on his door, and his wife opened. I swung the bat at her, and she collapsed. Then I heard screaming from his kids. I had the camcorder in one hand, and the bat in my other hand. I recorded the whole thing. He began to run. He was sitting on the couch watching TV. I chased him into the bathroom, where I destroyed the door while screaming at him. When I broke it down he was in the bathtub screaming, as I swung the bat at him for 2 whole minutes. Every time I hit him, his face got worse, I just swung, and never cared. I let him die while I ran into the room. I had put my camcorder down as I broke the door, and his kids were near his wife, who was knocked out. I told them to go in their rooms and to leave me alone. They were crying. I swung the bat at his wife a few times, until she was dead. Then I called 911 and said I had killed them.

I killed both of them. They were dead.

The prosecutor understood what I had happened, and it was relieved that he had been beating his wife, and even his children sometimes. So they sent me to a mental institution, but they didn't charge me with murder. They said I had been effected by the abuse and that the killing of him was ""justified"", but the wife was not. I was sent to the institution for 20 years, and now I'm out. I have no intention of committing anymore crimes.","In 1999, I killed a man and his wife with a baseball bat, for abusing me as a child in the early 90s. I got 20 years in a mental institution.

19811,ajolcb,post,"A year ago I was accused of rape and not only has it ruined my life, I feel i cant tell anyone because they wouldn't believe me.","For context a year ago or so me and a friend of mine ended up getting off at a club, she came on to me, I pushed her away because she had a boyfriend. We were both very drunk. 
Anyway we ended up splitting from the group and I walked the girl home, she said she was hungry so I brought her a pizza and we walked back to hers. I left her at the gate of her accommodation and I went to a friend's house because I was freaking out. 
The next day she woke up and said she didn't remember a thing about the night before. I said neither did I.
I debated for a week or so whether or not to tell her at the risk of losing a friendship that I thought was genuinely special. I got on with this girl like no man's business. Eventually the friend I saw that night convinced me to tell her so I did. 
She cried, I cried, I didn't know what to do, she called her boyfriend and asked me to speak to him. Stupidly I agreed.
My biggest fuck up came here where I told her that she could tell her boyfriend that I had kissed her, if that was gonna save her relationship (didn't think 3 years was worth losing for a kiss) 
So cut to a year later. She's spread a very different version of the story. Apparently she was drugged, I walked her home but she doesn't remember any of it, her friends saw me try it on with her and apparently she was 'very uncomfortable' (at the time there was nobody in the same area of the bar. There was mud on her bed sheets and Therefore there must have been mud on my shoes, I must have let myself in with her gate key, taken advantage of her and then fucked off. She even asked me after I told her 'if she needs to check the CCTV just to be sure?' But then why would I have told her in the first place? And why would I have gone to my friends house and told them everything. And why would I have tried to save the relationship if I didn't want her to be happy. I'm many things but I'm not a rapist. 

It's now got to the point where it can be debilitating at times. I know my friends don't believe it but I no longer have a relationship with anyone in that group. They make things awkward and obvious on campus, they've villainised me and amongst their circles told their version of the story which bears very little resemblance to the real one. I've tried to empathise that in her head she's the victim. But this is real life. And it's already having very real affects on me, I just don't want it to go any further

EDIT: I Can see that the timeline is a bit confusing for people so I'll try and simplify it

Got to the club at around 1am

We danced, drank, and just had a regular night out till about 3

At around 3 a load of our friends went to the bar, this is when she kissed me. I pushed her away.

We kept dancing and everything for another half an hour or so and then at like 3:30/4ish we left (I think originally for a cigarette but then we just decided to go home so I walked her back) 

It was about 4 we went to the takeaway to get pizza 

4:15ish we got back to hers, I dropped her at the gate, watched her walk up the stairs (didn't even go into the gated flat) and walked to my friends house. I was there for the rest of that night.

Cut to a week later, eventually my friends convinced me that because she didn't even remember the kiss I should tell her about that so she could decided what she wanted to do with her Boyfriend. That's when I told her what had happened.and shit kicked off

A week after that they're asking my friends if they know anything, accusing me of being in her room (they know I brought the pizza for her and mud on the sheets etc etc) they've made up little parts of the story which basically make out that rather than leaving her at the gate, I'd forced my way Inside and taken advantage of her and then just left her.

He plays a lot of online games and we can hear his rants against other players usually accompanied by racial slurs and death and even rape threats. He had also broken his consoles and computers multiple times in fits of rage and my mom will often end up buying him a new one since she figures he is less likely to be doing something illegal if he is screaming about getting his ass kicked in Fortnite or Smash Bros.

19813,ag807p,post,I feel like I raped someone but I don’t know if I did.,"A few years ago, I dated a girl who wasn’t sure what she wanted sexually - so we always experimented and I would start to try and initiate new things and listen to what she said or how she responded. We didn’t have sex our entire relationship because she was scared to have sex. After we broke up, she held sex over my head by saying “I was going to have sex with you last weekend at your formal”. Of course I was young and dumb and started hooking up with her again to try and have sex.

We did this thing where we would get down into our underwear and dry hump. I would take my dick out and penetrate her (or at least attempt to - I don’t know how far you can go in with underwear in the way) over top of her underwear. Well after she expressed that she wanted to have sex and had planned on it, I tried bringing things further and have sex.

When we would hook up after that, I would move her underwear to the side and slowly bring things further. I would warm her up and gauge her responses and would penetrate her under her underwear. I always told myself I’d stop if she said anything or even remotely looked disinterested - but that never happened. She always enjoyed herself, but I was always super nervous so I never put more than half my dick in at a time.

The last time we hooked up she asked “am I not a virgin anymore” and it made me think that she didn’t realize I had moved her underwear any of the other times. I just need a little guidance on how to move forward. I can’t talk to her anymore cause she’s moved on with her life, so that’s out of the picture.

19814,ad7jez,post,"She says I raped her, coming to terms with it","I don’t want to include every detail because I’m afraid someone I know will see this, but I’ll try to explain what happened. I lost my virginity to this girl weeks before the incident. I went over to her house and was fucked up on Xanex, one of the handful of times I’ve taken the drug. Foggy memories of that night didn’t become semi-clear until days after. I ask if she wants to have sex and pressure her into it, but not long into it she says “stop,” multiple times apparently, but I was too fucked up to notice it. Or more likely I didn’t care and was just blindly focusing on the act. After it happened I can’t remember if she was crying or not, but I must’ve known something was up because I just got up and left. I’m not even sure how I managed to drive home safely.

I went over to her house a few days later and we sat on her back stoop and talked. She tried to explain what happened, but my memory was unclear and I was too immature and reticent to listen probably. We stopped hanging out after that, of course. It’s not that I didn’t know I’d hurt her, but I didn’t know how to handle it. Flash-forward a few years and she’s telling everyone I’m a rapist. 

This was after I’d met up with her again randomly with some friends, we sat and talked about nothing in particular and she didn’t shy away from me or call me a rapist or anything. 

But when I saw her again a year or so later after that she had been telling everyone she could that I raped her. She wasn’t shy then, saying “I told you to stop.” And that’s basically all she would say. She was probably comforted by the fact that her shady gang of friends were with her then.

I’ve been wrestling with what I did and other times I’ve awkwardly and unknowingly taken advantage of women, nothing near as bad as this story. And I’m not trying to chalk up this incident as being pure awkwardness or naïveté, which I *was* full of. No. I used her for sex, and that’s about it. But I didn’t force intercourse with her, even though I did pressure her into it. We were practically on the verge of dating when this happened. It’s not like I wanted to use her and throw her away, but that’s basically what I did.

A friend of mine comforted me by saying something like “she’s not that attractive and pretty boring, so she says that to get attention.” I never really took much stock in those words, because that just seemed like the wrong analysis of the situation. That doesn’t mean what he said is necessarily untrue, but that doesn’t excuse how I hurt her.

Just wanted to get this off my chest so I could get some honest feedback. Maybe I’ll tell all the details one day when I feel confident enough. But I want to point out the modern Feminist lie of “rape is about power” that Susan Brownmiller started. No, for the majority of rapes sex is just about sex. Saying “rape is about power” is a political message that’s meant to eradicate rape from culture, which I’m all for. But that mindset ignores the motivations and feelings that people go through to do an act like I did.

19817,acnrdq,post,I had an incestuous relationship with my cousin.,"I haven’t posted on here in a while. But on my previous posts I promised I would post these stories. So here I am, a couple of years later. If you check out my post history you can find other equally fucked up stories.  


This is a long post, and is pretty graphic. It took me so long to write about this, because thinking about it puts me in a weird emotional and mental state. I don’t know how to feel about the events that transpired. I don’t want to use the word rape at all because I’m not sure if it is. I was young but I consented and I sought it out often. 

This happened so long ago that I don’t know what age I was when this started. I would visit family in California and I would share a room with my cousin. Let’s call him cooper. He’s older than me by 5 years. I have a lot of cousins but he was always the cool one. Played sports, was in shape, had cool stuff etc. During the daytime our parents would leave us alone and we had the whole house to ourselves. There was also an RV on his side lawn that we made into our fort. It was a really cool fort. We were hanging out playing video games when he said he wanted to show me something. He put in a porno on the VHS player. I was exposed to sex at a very young age so this was not new to me. We are watching the girl jackoff the guy and blowing him at the same time. The guy erupts and Cooper asks if I know what that is. I tell him cum. He seems stumped and then mutters have you seen it before? I told him I’ve watched a porn before but that I’ve never been able to cum. He asks if I want to see cum and I say sure. 


He sits on the couch and pulls down his pants and starts jerking off. I’m sitting on the floor in between his legs watching him. His dick is massive compared to my dick that can’t even get hard. Cooper asks me to grab him some toilet paper so I do, and I watch him blow his load into it. It was enchanting. He then asked me not to tell anyone. I haven’t except a therapist and now you guys. 


Every time I would visit Cooper things started to progress more and more. It started with true or dare. We would play while we were supposed to be sleeping. We would start off with silly truths but we always took it further. We would dare each other to touch the other person. “I dare you to suck my dick for 10 seconds” etc. That’s how the game was played. Every time I would visit California or he would visit my home state. Things started to change when he got a girlfriend. I was starting puberty and he was hornier than ever. We stopped playing the game and just allowed each other to explore. He asked me if I’ve ever kissed someone and i told him that i hadn’t. Cooper taught me how to kiss. He taught me more about sex. He was guiding me through this while also showing me how it’s done. This kept happening at least once a month. 


We moved to the same state eventually but after that we never really got the chance to fool around again. It started to fizzle. I don’t know what made him stop. I couldn’t stop thinking about it every time I saw him. I was completely thirsty for him but he seemed unbothered. I don’t know if he regrets his actions but I don’t. We never talk about it. 

Since then we have had three more encounters with each other. They all involved alcohol. The first time I was 16 and he had just turned 21. His brother threw a party for him and invited me. We drank and played games. When it was time to knock out I slept with Cooper in the same bed. It wasn’t really suspicious because there were no more beds available. We lay in bed talking, we’re making each other laugh, and having a great time. He’s sleeping without a shirt on so when I’m talking I can feel his chest. It felt prickly so I start feeling on his chest, and trying to distract him by asking him about how often he shaves. He’s answering me but I eventually get down to his stomach and I felt his dick. He was so hard. I didn’t hesitate, I just put my hand inside his boxers and started to jerk him off. 

Cooper: are you just going to jack me off or are you going to suck it 
*i go down on him for a couple of minutes and I feel a load in my mouth already*
Me: did you cum already? 
Cooper: No precum
* I go back to blowing him but he stops me and pushes my head away and turns to face away from me*
Me: wait so you came?
Cooper: we’re done
Me: so you’re just gonna leave me here horny? 
Cooper: yup 

I don’t know if hearing me talk mid blowjob turned him off, or if he started to feel guilty. The second time we hooked up I was 19. And it ended the same way again. We went to the beach with another cousin to do a bond fire. My other cousin got wasted and fell asleep in the back seat of the car. Cooper is driving and I’m in the passenger seat. We’re listening to music when cooper grabs my hand and puts it on his dick. I unzip him and start jerking him off.  He asks if I’m gonna blow him and I jump at the opportunity. I can hear my other cousin in the back seat going in and out of consciousness so I tell cooper that I’m gonna stop because I don’t want to get caught but that when he drops me off at home I’ll finish him off. After an hour drive back home he drops off my other drunk cousin and when he pulls up in my drive way I try to kiss him. He turns away and the stubble of his beard burns me. I ask him if he wants me to finish him off and he says no, maybe another day. 


Nothing happened until I was 24. Cooper is married and he has kids. We went to a country bar and they’re having their annual special. 25 cents for any drinks for the first two hours. Needless to say, everyone was hammered. When we got back to coopers house his wife passed out on the ottoman and I went to bed with cooper. I’m not too clear on the details of this night but this is what I remember. Cooper is falling over trying to change into his pjs so I start helping him out. While I’m doing that his wife walks in! She see me pulling down his pants and guess what she does!? She helps me! I leave her to help him get dressed while I change into clothes that I brought. She leaves to go to sleep on the ottoman and I head into bed. The lights were off so when I got into Coopers bed he was partly on my side. I try to push his leg over but he grabs my arm forcing me on top of him. We start to passionately make out. I’m telling him how much I want this. And he says he wants my ass. I start blowing him and while I’m doing that I’m licking my fingers and trying to lube my ass with my spit at the same time. After I feel like my hole is good enough I try to put his dick inside me. I’m not a bottom but the thought of having my cousin inside of me is exciting. He’s in and were making out. I’m very uncomfortable but I keep going. I’m trying to jack off so I can enjoy this as well. He starts feeling on my stomach and goes down towards my dick. But then when he felt my dick, he pushes me off of him, off the bed and says what the fuck. What is that? And I’m like uh my dick. And he says no, no, no. Get away from me. So I go and sleep on the couch. Maybe he thought I was his wife? I’m not too sure. 


I’ve moved away and we still Snapchat each other but we don’t mention anything. I’ve asked him and his wife to come  visit me and they want to. If anything else happens I’ll update you guys. Well that’s pretty much it. Thanks for reading. Ask me any questions below. And read my other posts too! ","I had an incestuous relationship with my cousin. I haven’t posted on here in a while. But on my previous posts I promised I would post these stories. So here I am, a couple of years later. If you check out my post history you can find other equally fucked up stories.  


This is a long post, and is pretty graphic. It took me so long to write about this, because thinking about it puts me in a weird emotional and mental state. I don’t know how to feel about the events that transpired. I don’t want to use the word rape at all because I’m not sure if it is. I was young but I consented and I sought it out often. 

This happened so long ago that I don’t know what age I was when this started. I would visit family in California and I would share a room with my cousin. Let’s call him cooper. He’s older than me by 5 years. I have a lot of cousins but he was always the cool one. Played sports, was in shape, had cool stuff etc. During the daytime our parents would leave us alone and we had the whole house to ourselves.

How awful. They can never ignore, dismiss, or sweep away their actions. Sort of like how his victim can never hide from her rape. At least he gets to not hide from his own decision while she is suffering from not hiding from his decision.

19858,cae800d,comment,,"You know, it used to be that people sat around during the long winters when they were snowed in with nothing to do , and while they mended tools, repaired clothing and embroidered, they told stories. Stories like the boy who cried wolf, and the story of how uncle bill lost his hand when he tried to steal a honeycomb from a bear. These tales were to help the young ones gain experience without having to make the same mistakes themselves. These are valuable stories.

A murderer can go to jail, and get out, and no one may be the wiser. A sex offender is followed for life by this registry and it has no reflection at all on how the person is now. Like a bad photo on your driver's license, you know, the one where you had that haircut you keep trying to forget. It never goes away.

As humans we have an instinct to find those of us who have made mistakes, to separate them and label them and keep tabs on them. Sometimes this is beneficial, and sometimes it is incredibly harmful.

Some people will feel that what he did was unforgivable, that he deserves whatever he got. To that I can only say that our legal system assigns a punishment to every crime, and once you have paid the price for your actions, you get a chance to try again.

There are people out there who just want to be normal, and they really can do it, and perhaps help old ladies cross the street, or a motorist broken down by the road, or even identify someone in danger of making the same mistake, and tell them the story of what happened to them, and help them take a different path.

On the one hand we can all relate to what OP did, to the sense of justice OP felt. And at the same time there is a lesson to be learned from this. That sometimes the righteous path is the one where we temper judgement with patience and compassion, and perhaps see the person first, and fight our eagerness for retribution.

Thanks for sharing this. This kind of story is important to tell."," You know, it used to be that people sat around during the long winters when they were snowed in with nothing to do , and while they mended tools, repaired clothing and embroidered, they told stories.

19861,cae0wf2,comment,,"I'm personally fucking shocked and disgusted by how harsh you guys are being, respondents.  I mean really.  /r/confessions contains stories left and right from abusers explaining how they have hurt people (including children), and *this* post is the one that elicits this reaction:

>I feel dirty reading this. I don't think I've ever read anything here that disgusts me like this does. Let's never be friends, okay?

First of all, remember that we're not here to judge.  Second of all, I sense some urge to downplay sex abuse from many of these responses.  The fact is that sex offenders do reoffend, and if they're off the radar and not obeying the conditions of their parole (as implied by the registry's information) then there's a legit concern.  I agree that outing him to the class was an immature move, but presumably OP was about 20 at the time.  How many people haven't done something extraordinarily dumb and hurtful at 20?

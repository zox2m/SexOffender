22647,e6wu8dv,comment,,"In today’s society, literally ANYTHING can be construed as sexual assault or harassment.  Websites need to be taken down that foster hooking up, men should just saw off their genitalia, and we should all be raised to live in a completely washed lifestyle that forbids any sexual contact without proper paperwork, extensive training, and formal monitoring to ensure 100% compliance.

A woman can change her mind at the blink of an eye when it comes to consent, even during sex.  Men have zero rights, and it is completely ok for women to change their consent later ... even years later.  The man must be held completely accountable because of regretful women who change their minds after and make accusations which must all be believed because women never ever accuse and it’s false.

Women do not exist that have rape fantasies, at all.  If they do, they should be jailed.  I mean, women NEVER have those... right?

As a man today, only real way to live is with your dick in a box where only a woman maintains a key, you’re prevented from looking at women, especially suggestively, zero sexual culture without permission from women, and all of your sexual life under complete control with severe punishments.

Guess how big the rule book is going to become, just to fuck?

Oh and of course, women get free reign to change any rules, depending on which direction the wind is blowing, at any moment and for any reason... that suits their needs, feelings, emotions, or agendas.  No one gets to question that either.

22668,e4k4yuv,comment,,"Women are all too familiar with unwanted flirtation, suggestive comments, cat calls, propositions, unwanted touching, and sexual assault. And yet, sometimes women freeze up in the moment because it’s embarrassing, humiliating, or frightening - and *because we know men have the strength to hurt us.* 

Men are not typically fending off sexually aggressive women. Flirtation or touching is more likely to be positively received.  Also, men generally do not feel physically threatened by women.  

To feel desired by another person can feel magical.  For women, it creates a delemma carefully balance thdilema
You were in a vulnerable state, the masseuse unexpectedly begins to stroke your erection, and it felt good - but not threatening.  It’s difficult for women to relate to that, because our perspective is so seriously twisted in another direction.  Of course, she’s also pissed because it feels like cheating, and that drowns her in self-doubt.

22669,e4k56ge,comment,,"This is sexual assault.  Don't feel bad for freezing up and not stopping it - that is a natural response. You didn't seek it out, you were definitely not asking for it, this is not your fault. I'm female and I've been in a similar situation during a massage - guy rubbing the sides of my boobs and holding my hand against his crotch while ""massaging"" my arm. I did nothing, didn't stop it, didn't say anything after, just got the hell out of there. It's a weird and horrible situation where you have put trust in someone while in a vulnerable place and they violate that trust.

If you read this OP I recommend heading over to r/menslib and asking for help - they will be very understanding and probably have some good suggestions.

Good luck with your fiancée - I know that this will be hard for her to deal with, especially since we are all trained to think men can't be sexually assaulted, but I hope she can understand it was not your intent for this to happen, and get passed it."," This is sexual assault.

You were sexually assaulted. In the moment it can be so hard to do anything. Like your mind stops working. You’re naked, in an unfamiliar place in a vulnerable moment. Not everyone’s reaction to these situations is to yell fuck off.

If you didn’t intentionally go for a sensual massage and someone touched your body without your consent, that is not ok regardless of your gender.

Your fiancé should be supporting you through this not saying “well you were violated and now I’m not sure I want to be with you.”

The comments here are so incredibly insane to me.

She touched you. You didn’t want it. You were too scared/in shock to do anything. ———-> sexual assault.

J advise reading articles about real OCD. I think i read one years ago from ocdspecialists and it was extremely helpful. 
Children at this age are curious about bodies and sex. Many unanswered questions and there is a lot of exploring. Brains are not fully developed.  The behavior was not good but you would never do that now.  
Also as kids a lot of boy girl siblings are naked in front of each other (sometimes the moms change the kids like that) but of course that would not happen now. The awareness changes with age. 
I recommend seeing a therapist and discuss with them how or if you should bring up to your brother. 
When i was 4 i kissed my mom on the mouth in a passionate way (i was trying out the long kisses on tv, i didn't understand it was only for romantic context). I remember my mom was like what are you doing!!! And i was sad. Of course being older i am horrified.  And i never talked to anyone about it again.  Obviously it was not for any sexual gratification. You don't even know what that is as a kid.  It is trying to make sense of the world and the things we see on tv as such and copying what we see.

Kids do stupid things. 
How is your relationship with brother these days? If there does not seem to be tension,  i think it is ok. In elementary school i remember a boy touched my groin when he was picking me up.  But i forgive him because...i actually didn't feel traumatized at the time.  Looking back it was wrong. We were both kids.  But it was not even in a sexual way like to illicit sensations. I think he was copying what he saw on tv. He's married now with kids. We have never talked about it. If he did that now i would call the cops. You didn't really know what you were doing as a kid. Even if your brother remembers,  who is to say he is traumatized or doesn't forgive you or understand? Maybe it is just awkward to talk about but he knows you were a kid too.

Unfortunately for you both it should NOT of happened but it did . It happens alot very sadly for very young kids . I am sorry it is a consequence of being told or shown it , or made to do it to you/ on you  & then **you not knowing NOT to do so did it repeating it  to another child .**

**Kids do NOT have the mental capacity NOT to repeat such behaviours ( as they are forbidden & tap into the sexual driving mechanisms that should NOT have been activated in any way in the first place As they are a child .**

**So Unless told NOT to do it & given sexual trauma therapy strategies to help the poor child then they will do it without a doubt NOT understanding why they do except that it feels good to them .** And this does NOT occur as most kids exposed to such behaviours which are abnormal and aren't 'normal experimenting as with yours . Then will do it NOT having any idea it is wrong & damaging to another child as they are a CHILD themselves.

You also cannot be held accountable at all for such actions at such a very YOUNG age. YOU had NO idea what you were doing or why . YOu were repeating only such behavour as a learned behaviour eg- copying it .This is why child seual assault is so damaging to the child subjected to it . They can start a cycle of devastating results from the continuation of it . NOT knowing NOT to do it to another child .  YOu are NOT accountable for it you were under the age of any kind of understanding it  . But that also doesn't change the on-going damaging consequences for YOU & your bro bc of it . This is why it is imperative children NEEDing to be better watched near other kids to make sure this does NOT occur . Kids should NOT be allowed to sexually experiment in any way with each other. And **NEEDS to be taken as serious** not forgotten about or thought of as harmless.

But most parents have NO idea also it is occurring or some dumb f\*cks think it is nothing to worry about. It is it leaves on-going lasting mental / sexual damage to kids exposed to early onset invasive sexual experiences . For some it is not as damaging mentally / emotionally to the child ( as it might have been more gentle experimenting btw kids ) but to others it leaves lasting imposing sexual confusion ( eg- if same sex experiences ) or is rough  forced ( child is scared ) or violent ( with physical violence added to it ) where it is  invasive sexual contact to the child being exposed to it . Eg- they are bullyed into it , or have it forced on them by another child  in violence . Then on-going devastating  consequences can occur by  this. How much mental trauma is left in the children involved depends how long it occurs & how violent it is . It can & usually does then lead to some degree of  on-going sexual issues / relo issues , self harm issues, s\*icidal issues ,  or can yes also lead to outward out of control behaviours due to anger issues in the child who can't understand what has occurred to them . As it happened to them at such a young age.

>though I do remember an inappropriate moment with my moms boss, probably around that time if not a bit younger.

Don't dismiss your catalyst of your own behavour pattern that then displayed it's self . It doesn't take much which is so s\*it to fc8k up a child life altering it to repeat wrongful behaviours. Even one scary invasive experience can do it  ( from either a child or adult ) , as it  then stays in the child's subconscious activating patterns then of poss on-going trauma responses ( eg- the sexual experimenting with another child ) . It is more than relevant even a small incident to a child  . Most kids also then don't tell anyone it happened ( as most don't also even understand it was wrong  or maybe even what the f\*ck even happened to them ) or the perp will threaten the child NOT to tell, or will threatened the child ( who takes things as very real ) as a real threat seriously  to themselves or another person ( eg- your mum in this case ) .

>For those saying that my brother remembers, I know that is likely very very accurate 😭 I think I hold onto the idea that he doesn’t remember because it at least helps me to not hate myself as much 😭😭 but deep down, I know that he probably does remember:(

Yes it is poss he might remember or not . YOu won't know unless you were to 'talk ' to him about it . It was a once off mistake by yourself . So  you do have to try & learn to forgive yourself for it in some way . This might be helped by 'talking ' to him one day . It might go weirdly ok in that you can tell him the truth you are sorry it happened but also you also only did it once to him . And you can talk about why it occurred due to the incident with the boss. As if he did it to you (the sicko boss) YOU definitely would of repeated the behavour as you would of thought it was normal to 'feel'  .And the perp also probably dropped the line of it is normal to do to you also with someone else . But then when you did it with him your bro  ( your own  protection mode then also dropped in ) it can happen where the child knows enough to then sense it was 'wrong' to do . As you did . So you never did it again . NOt all kids have the switch off mechanism to protect other kids enough but you did . So could . If you didn't YOU would of kept doing it , as the hypersexual arousal would off taken over rather than your protection mode ( for yourself & bro ) in your household. As the over drive of arousal is stronger in kids if abuse is present in kids for a longer time.

YOu have the right to forgive yourself you were a very young child ( who was shown / made to do something you didn't even understand ) back then that is was even wrong to do ( the ONLY way for you to have discovered this was to try it ) which then enabled your protection of self via emotional guilt beginning processing to occur to allow you then NOT to do it again ( if you didn't have emotional safety to know NOT to do it ) you would of overridden it to continue on doing it  .

I wonder all the time if he remembers. I feel like there's no way he couldn't since he's older than me. I feel similar to you, where it feels hard to be supportive in his life events because I feel like I hate him for what he did. I have only told a couple people: 2 close friends and my fiance know.

Not that it makes any of it right, but if it started when you were 6-7 then that makes her 8-9. So you both were egregiously young and seemed both  of you were victimized into thinking it was ""normal"" behavior .

I want to preface by saying that I am not defending  your sister in any way, especially as an adult and still being silent. I also want to preface and say that I too was SA’d by a sibling who also never apologized or acknowledged it happened and this occurred most of my childhood. And I only share that so that you know my frame of mind and that I have unwanted insider knowledge of this trauma. 

But I wanted to say, your sister was definitely SAd as well by someone else. Probably during her child hood and around the same time you were experiencing this. I URGE YOU to talk with your sister. Maybe invite her to a therapy session or just to a park or something your comfortable with and tell her that it eats you up inside and you want to know if it happened to her. She may NEED you to be the strong one because she not only carry’s the guilt of abusing you every day of her life, she also carry’s the shame from her abuser. I was angry for so long at so many people, and then I learned how cycles of abuse happen and it became apparent that my sibling was also traumatized as a younger kid. My story came out, with out my permission so I was forced to face it, and I still do not speak with my sibling because he denied it as a grown man to my mom when she asked him. (A confidant I told decided to take it upon their selves to confront sibling) anyway I digress….im just saying I URGE you to talk about this more, talk with her about it and start healing. And maybe one day you’ll get the courage to speak with your friends you inadvertently and potentially damaged as your sister did to you as well. 

At 19 I still had only ever told 1 bf, and 2 best friends and begged them to never tell a soul because I was so ashamed. At 36 I can freely share my story and off load shame and pain every time. Lastly I’ll add this. My husband whom is a great man was SA as a little boy, and passed some of those curiosities to his little sisters just 1&2 years younger. When he became a young adult he carried so much pain and hurt and guilt from his early years and one day told his sister that he just never knew it was wrong and when he learned he stopped and never meant her any harm and told her how sorry he was and begged for her forgiveness, which she provided with so much love and understanding. I’m not even sure I could have done that for my own brother BUT I know his trauma was real and severe and I know he was sincere and wanted to make sure she knew it wasn’t her fault and share his side of things and trauma.

You don’t have to work towards having a relationship with your sister if you don’t want to, but if you would like to I really think you would be able to achieve that with a bit of therapy.

You’ve been able to give grace to yourself for doing the same thing to other people I truly believe you can find a way to get past this with your sister if you want to. And if you don’t want to that’s OK too.

If you can forgive yourself for what you did after what was done to you you can probably forgive her because something must have been done to her. This type of stuff doesn’t just start out of nowhere.

I had a similar experience. 
My sister would have me do things with her or her friends.
I don’t remember how old I was when it started. But I know I blocked out ages 4-7. And have done counseling because of it. 
But I also know that my older sisters were sexually assaulted by my father, for majority of their childhood.
I choose to understand that she was probably just mimicking behavior done to her. 

I’ve talked or written a letter to those people about what happened. Explaining that I was very young and had no concept of what I was doing. And repeated this learned behavior I didn’t know was sexual at the time. I ask them how they want to move forward, as my lack of knowledge doesn’t take away the impact I created. 
 You can even just journal. Or do a burn letter that expresses what is going through your mind, and address it even to your sister.

But if you are writing about this now, it is coming back into your mind. And with alcohol or other things. It just will naw at you. So journaling helps. And they have journal prompts online too.

Good luck, it gets better. And sorry if it projected any of my situation onto you. Just wanted you to know that you aren’t horrible and life just is complicated as hell.

And no matter what, you couldn’t have known better, IT WASN’T YOUR FAULT!. Please know that. 

Dialectical behavior therapy works too.

The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook: Practical DBT Exercises for Learning Mindfulness, Interpersonal Effectiveness, Emotion Regulation, ... (A New Harbinger Self-Help Workbook)
https://a.co/d/iIW9V9K

Description-
A clear and effective approach to learning evidence-based DBT skills—now in a fully revised and updated second edition.

Do you have trouble managing your emotions? First developed by Marsha M. Linehan for treating borderline personality disorder, dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) has proven effective as treatment for a range of other mental health problems, and can greatly improve your ability to handle distress without losing control and acting destructively. However, to make use of these techniques, you need to build skills in four key areas: distress tolerance, mindfulness, emotion regulation, and interpersonal effectiveness.

The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook, a collaborative effort from three esteemed authors, offers evidence-based, step-by-step exercises for learning these concepts and putting them to work for real and lasting change. Start by working on the introductory exercises and, after making progress, move on to the advanced-skills chapters. Whether you’re a mental health professional or a general reader, you’ll benefit from this clear and practical guide to better managing your emotions.

This fully revised and updated second edition also includes new chapters on cognitive rehearsal, distress tolerance, and self-compassion. Once you’ve completed the exercises in this book and are ready to move on to the next level, check out the authors’ new book, The New Happiness Workbook."," Matthew McKay PhD and 2 more

I agree it doesn’t excuse your behavior but it does EXPLAIN your behavior. You yourself were a victim and she would find understanding in that.

That being said I dont have any contact with him because he had denied it to my mom as an adult and I just couldn’t believe that, and clearly didn’t have enough remorse about it. 

But all that to say, yes I’d want an apology to help me move on. Also, I respectfully disagree with your therapist and the other therapist statement you restated. It’s traumatizing to make a victim approach their accuser.

One big group of friends. At the time I was too embarrassed to say anything, after I grew up a little I was too scared to say anything because several people I deeply cared about were extremely close to him and I didn’t want THEM to be mad at me. When I was 15 I finally told my mom after she had me around him again and he would not quit staring at me and for some reason that was just my breaking point. I asked her not to tell anyone, a fact I honestly think she was relieved about. To her credit she never made me go around him again but it also felt like she didn’t really believe me or thought I was blowing things out of proportion (I did tend to be a bit dramatic as a kid). When he died when I was 17 my mom told me like it was going to be sad news for me. I think she was shocked when all I said was “good”. It wasn’t until I was an adult that I fully informed her of what he had done, she was shocked because thought that it was me misconstruing something because she couldn’t believe he’d be like THAT, but this couldn’t be misconstrued. Now I’m extremely vocal about what he did, I won’t back down and I feel no shame it’s a relief. Both my parents had little viles of his ashes, after that I never saw them at either house again. 

I guess the point is that it’s never too late to tell and you should never be ashamed to tell. But everyone’s journey to that point is their own and it has to be on your terms. But once you do, it’s…freeing. When and if you’re ever ready just remember that it’s not your fault, it was never your fault and it doesn’t matter what anyone else thinks about it.

I have PTSD from SA and spent many years in therapy and considered myself pretty well ""recovered"".

We were planning an homebirth with a midwife but unfortunately, at 35 weeks my water broke prematurely and I had to be induced.

I was desperate not to be forced to give birth on my back.

My male doctor I've never met wouldn't even address me personally while talking about me right in front of me. 

I labored faster than they expected and wasn't able to get an epidural, and then when it came time to push, they forced me to remain on my back despite my pleads, forced my husband to be one of the people to help restrain me, and the doctor, without consent or explanation, began shoving his hand into me while I was supposed to be pushing. I struggled so hard because my body was trying to get away from him instead of pushing the way I needed to. 

My husband literally couldn't even hold my fucking hand during the birth of our first child because he was helping to restrain me. 

Apparently the doctor was giving me a ""Perineal massage"" to prevent tearing, which like... yeah. I'm glad I didn't tear, but there was absolutely no consent, no consideration, no explanation. 

I feel so guilty for complaining because compared to others it was ""easy"". I only labored for 7.5 hours and pushed for 20 minutes, but all I can think about is how fucking traumatic the whole thing was.

My daughter is coming up on 3 months now and I still can't bring myself to have sex with my husband and it's starting to affect things. I can't believe how much I've regressed from this event.

C'est possible que votre mari ait été réellement infidèle, mais c'est impossible à prouver, donc avoir une conversation honnête avec une 3e personne présente (thérapeute) pourrait être une bonne idée.

I don't know if it's normal, but please don't judge me 

Hello, 

To put you in context, I met my 1st stepfather when I was 2/3 years old, he's the one who's taken care of me (with my mother) until today and I'll be 24 in a few days, they separated when I was 17 but despite that nothing changed, it was always him who provided for my needs, He always took me to restaurants, paid for my clothes, I always went with him to do activities, he always kept his fatherly role, but how to explain it, for some time now (around mid 2020) he's been changing, but on the wrong side and all this little by little, I don't know what's happened in his head (maybe it's me who's grown up? ) but he's become a lot heavier, a lot more manipulative, sometimes we'd have evenings in his café drinking but in those moments he was more ""at ease"" with his words, his way of doing things... it's become really heavy, to the point where I'm ashamed to say it but he raped me several times but I don't really have any memories just I know,

It's been a while since I lost my job, so I'm having a hard time making ends meet, knowing that I'm taking care of everything at home, rent, insurance, the whole mess, because my mom's on depression, so she's not working, and she's having problems with the MDPH, so everything's on my back. I'm not complaining at all, but that's to explain the situation I'm in, when I'm in need of anything I naturally turn to him but little by little he's become very ""if you want this, I want a nude"" ""if you want me to help you with that, I want you to do this"" ""it's give and take in life"", it's gotten so bad that now when I say no and he asks me to s\*cer it, he threatens to show my nudes to anyone who will see him, I know he'll never do it but the fact of threatening me with . . 

In the last few days, I've left home because my new father-in-law is really a dog to me and I didn't feel safe at home anymore, so I ran away to my father-in-law's and every time I was with him, all he did was ask me to do things.

I went back to my mother's yesterday, we argued because I was fed up, I exploded, but I feel just as alone as before, I have no one to talk to about it, I don't know how I'm going to manage these next few days with my 56 cents in my account and my morale lower than earth,

But I'd just like to know if this is NORMAL? I've reached a point where I'm blaming myself, even though I know deep down that it's not normal, that I didn't have to go through all this, but I don't know anymore..."," I ran it through a translator:

22985,m2lf404,comment,,"SA is such a tricky one for me, because it's the only crime or tort that doesn't require an element of intent. There are many situations, maybe like this one, where someone was SA'd but the other person(s) involved may have been totally unaware. As demonstrated by other posters in this thread, other people have been in the same situation, but it doesn't feel/reach the level of SA - and she may not have had any way to know what situation he was experiencing. She might have asked, and he enthusiastically consented at the time.

OP's description, emotions, and reactions are consistent with being SA'd.  Her actions, as described in this post, could be completely innocent, or not. Morally (IMHO), it comes down to whether the aggressor intended to act without consideration of the other person's wishes. 

Irrespective of all of this, OP, I am so sorry that you had to go through this experience. I see you, I believe you, and I wish you peace and healing."," SA is such a tricky one for me, because it's the only crime or tort that doesn't require an element of intent.

As demonstrated by other posters in this thread, other people have been in the same situation, but it doesn't feel/reach the level of SA - and she may not have had any way to know what situation he was experiencing. She might have asked, and he enthusiastically consented at the time.

OP's description, emotions, and reactions are consistent with being SA'd.  Her actions, as described in this post, could be completely innocent, or not. Morally (IMHO), it comes down to whether the aggressor intended to act without consideration of the other person's wishes. 

Irrespective of all of this, OP, I am so sorry that you had to go through this experience. I see you, I believe you, and I wish you peace and healing.",31,,2024-12-18 02:07:22,t3_1hgp161,,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1hgp161/i_was_sad_by_a_friend_of_a_friend_then_made_to/m2lf404/,Neutral

Does OP know what happened the night before? (We don’t know because it isn’t mentioned in the post.) 

If she was drunk the night before also, then that negates any rape charge because she couldn’t consent either. 

In the eyes of the law, neither of them could consent. And no court will ever charge both parties with rape. 

Yes, she got in the shower without asking but he also didn’t tell her he didn’t want her there. She asks him to fuck her and he does. That’s consensual intercourse. 

I have no doubt that this experience changed OP but that was because he made poor choices. The problem is that he has taken no responsibility for his poor choices and instead blames the girl and his friend. 

Calling this SA cheapens the trauma felt by real rape victims (like me).

23004,m2mkq9j,comment,,"You have my sympathy for both the assault and the betrayal you received from your friends.  After reading many of the responders to your post, I have developed a POV that some folks may not agree with, but I wanted to share it anyway.  I believe that at the time of this event, you were still processing the trauma of your breakup, hence your early lack of interest in going out and getting together with crowds of friends and strangers.  Your best friend kept pushing, though, because he wanted you to get back to normal, and like many young men, he believed that getting you back into action would instantly cure your grief and trauma and give him his friend back.  In fact, this idea was shared by your other friends, and, indeed, it was the only thing they could think of that was likely to help you.  Young men sometimes have limited knowledge about friendship and how to walk with friends during difficult times; these are skills gained in maturity.  

So ultimately, you caved, thinking it couldn't hurt to get together with your best friend and the rest of the friend group.  Here's where it begins to slide:  it was a set-up with this young woman that everyone knew about except you.  When you pretty much instantly figured it out and enlightened the boys about not being interested AT ALL, not wanting to play their game, etc., what happened?  THEY IGNORED YOU.  They doubled down on getting you to drink more and pushing you and the Designated Lovely closer together.   And why? Well, this plan was their only plan, and if your only tool is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.

Leaping ahead to the morning when you are awakening to a scene you don't understand, your plan was to clean up and get away.  But then you have the shower scene, demonstrating clearly that the Designated Lovely not only remembered what had happened but was looking for an encore.  In that moment, what do you do that will paint you in the least obnoxious light in the years of her story-telling to come?  So that's what you did -- sorta -- and got out of there as quickly as possible, only to fairly  soon realize that you had been re-traumatized by the layers of betrayal and fear that came out of that encounter.  

Ultimately, you had the odd wedding event but more importantly, you recognized that the boys were just that:  boys and not grown men who could not dig deep and be actual friends when you needed them to be.

I'm glad you're building a relationship with your therapist, and it sounds like you are ready to trust her with your story and get her help in working through the trauma.  

Some of your responders have tried to say that your assault was not as important, real, painful, or difficult as theirs was because God only knows why.  Let me explain something:  this is not a competition, nor is it a race, nor is there a prize given for the best or worst story.  Everyone who has had a sexual encounter that was not of their choosing has the same passport into survivorship.  

I, myself, was assaulted when I was 24 years old, many years ago.  I often use the word ""assault"" because some survivors can hear that as an entry point, and some responders can do the same.  But make no mistake:  I was raped, in every way, in ways boring and imaginative.  I was not sure that I was going to survive, and then I was not sure that he was going to.  After several horrific hours (in my apartment) he was pulling himself together to leave, and I was shaking on my couch.  He threw me an Afghan that my grandmother had made, and said ""We should have dinner sometime"".  

So I know that it is important to process the trauma, to have tools ready for when you might be triggered, and to have reasonable goals set in hopes that you will trust people again.  Wishing you much luck and Godspeed."," You have my sympathy for both the assault and the betrayal you received from your friends.  After reading many of the responders to your post, I have developed a POV that some folks may not agree with, but I wanted to share it anyway.  I believe that at the time of this event, you were still processing the trauma of your breakup, hence your early lack of interest in going out and getting together with crowds of friends and strangers.  Your best friend kept pushing, though, because he wanted you to get back to normal, and like many young men, he believed that getting you back into action would instantly cure your grief and trauma and give him his friend back.  In fact, this idea was shared by your other friends, and, indeed, it was the only thing they could think of that was likely to help you.  Young men sometimes have limited knowledge about friendship and how to walk with friends during difficult times; these are skills gained in maturity.  

So ultimately, you caved, thinking it couldn't hurt to get together with your best friend and the rest of the friend group.  Here's where it begins to slide:  it was a set-up with this young woman that everyone knew about except you.  When you pretty much instantly figured it out and enlightened the boys about not being interested AT ALL, not wanting to play their game, etc., what happened?  THEY IGNORED YOU.  They doubled down on getting you to drink more and pushing you and the Designated Lovely closer together.   And why? Well, this plan was their only plan, and if your only tool is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.

Leaping ahead to the morning when you are awakening to a scene you don't understand, your plan was to clean up and get away.  But then you have the shower scene, demonstrating clearly that the Designated Lovely not only remembered what had happened but was looking for an encore.  In that moment, what do you do that will paint you in the least obnoxious light in the years of her story-telling to come?  So that's what you did -- sorta -- and got out of there as quickly as possible, only to fairly  soon realize that you had been re-traumatized by the layers of betrayal and fear that came out of that encounter.

She obviously remembered the events of the night before where you had no memory of it at all. She might have been drunk/tipsy but she wasn't past the event horizon into black-out drunk. I had something very similar happen to me and sometimes I look back and wonder how everyone at that party joked about it (the rape and my subsequent noises apparently) the next morning when, the night before, I had told all my friends that alcohol was tasting like water and I was going to the bedroom because I knew i was going to pass out (which I knew because they joked about that as well). 


They also said it sounded like I was enjoying it, and that was exactly what kept me from realizing the gravity of what had happened. I felt like I had no right to act like it was an offense if it had sounded like I was enjoying it. So I just kept quiet about it. I have yet to touch this one in therapy lol.

I forgive my friends way more than I forgive the offender, though I do forgive him now years later. I think that my friends were assuming and hoping that it was just a fun thing, but the guy absolutely snuck in there to do exactly what happened because I was passed out. I did come to a couple times during the act and I remember freaking out but it was literally a couple seconds before my brain shut off again. I'm not saying that the offender in your case was malicious or that mine was. But they were both definitely taking advantage of an opportunity that normally would not have presented itself.

People really need to stop drinking to this extent because she doesn't see it as you getting SA'd. For all she knows, you were into her and then ghosted her and you're the bad guy.

When it comes to drinking/drugs its hard to tell whats going on and easy to gaslight people. You may be a victim but so is she if she has no idea how you feel and just remembers you coming on to her and sleeping together.

When your therapy is done, I hope you find love, peace and happiness. Because you deserve it to be happy and give closure to your troubled past. Believe me, been there done that. I talked to everyone I mistreated and also the people whom mistreated me and found my peace. I don't drink at all anymore and that will stay this way the rest of my life (52 years old now)

Whether the women were ones you would choose to be with while sober or not, each situation was lacking consent and should have that factor acknowledged by you.

23105,m2lp758,comment,,"You're right. He COULD have just walked out. Technically, yes, that's exactly what he ""should"" have done. And what's part of what makes sexual trauma so complex to navigate for victims. We self blame: coulda woulda Shoulda.

Thing is, humans are way more complex than binary fight or flight. We also have freeze and fawn. Many victims of assault tend to shut down and will often make poor decisions in the wake of trauma because their reasoning capabilities have shut down. Our pre frontal cortex, responsible for higher decision making can shut down under certain stressors, including sexual trauma.

I had a boyfriend that I technically consented to having sex with probably hundreds of times when he KNEW I didn't want it, and was only giving in because he wouldn't take no for an answer. But I DID consent. So.... did the act of having sex while my mind screamed no traumatized me? Absa fucking lootley. Should I never have said yes? Of course. Should I have left the relationship? Duh. Is me going though that my fault? Maybe. But I loved him. People are complicated. And we make dumb decisions. But just because a decision is dumb doesn't mean it doesn't hurt us.

He TOLD her no in the shower. He actively said he didn't want anything. He didn't engage. What he did do is give in, and give up resisting someone else ignoring that no.

Even if she was completely pissed out of her mind the night before (which she wasn't  based on her comments on the night before) that doesn't change the fact that he wasn't interested in her or having sex before while he was still sober - aka still fully able to give consent. 

So yea... we have ALL experienced instances where we could have made better choices in our own interests. But there is a huge difference in our level of accountability between us being in full possession of our faculties and therefore being able to fully and intentionally and ENTHUSIASTICALLY consent, and giving in because the decision making part of our brain has shut down for whatever reason."," You're right. He COULD have just walked out. Technically, yes, that's exactly what he ""should"" have done. And what's part of what makes sexual trauma so complex to navigate for victims. We self blame: coulda woulda Shoulda.

Thing is, humans are way more complex than binary fight or flight. We also have freeze and fawn. Many victims of assault tend to shut down and will often make poor decisions in the wake of trauma because their reasoning capabilities have shut down. Our pre frontal cortex, responsible for higher decision making can shut down under certain stressors, including sexual trauma.

I had a boyfriend that I technically consented to having sex with probably hundreds of times when he KNEW I didn't want it, and was only giving in because he wouldn't take no for an answer. But I DID consent. So.... did the act of having sex while my mind screamed no traumatized me? Absa fucking lootley. Should I never have said yes? Of course. Should I have left the relationship? Duh.

Because I had the intention of getting laid at all now this makes any difference on the situation because i was asking for it? Did I understand that correctly? If I said that about a girl I would be roasted. 

Imagine if i was s girl, got drunk and was hit on by some hideous dude and blacks out, ends up sleeping with him, she wakes up next to a stranger, immediately regrets in the morning like OP did. People would say lock the guy up. Even if there was video evidence of her coming onto him. Even if he too was drunk. 

 Its just crazy to me at alarming numbers people drunk hook up. Both parties making questionable decisions. But then some people wake up and decide how they feel about the situation depending on if the get the ick the next morning.
If they feel embarrassed about the person, some convince themselves they ""feel"" they had to been coerced into it, and decide they are a victim.

 And if there is a victim that means there is a predator. 

 Plenty of guys have been railroaded for SA because the girl was embarrassed about who she slept with in the morning. 

If a guy made decisions of victimhood based on looks like that it wouldn't fly usually. 

Dont get me wrong there are plenty of instances someone should be protected and are too drunk. Plenty. But this is such a Grey area is all I'm saying and people want to make it black and white. People calling this girl a predator for drunk hooking up, and saying she is guilty full stop cause she wanted more in the morning. 

Who's to judge the magic line when someone goes from being able to consent to not being able to consent when drinking? 

What happens when both people are passed that line? Both victims? 

Also the freeze mentality is something that much more applies to at risk individuals and instances of power inequality. I find it hard to say that this dude was raped in the shower cause he ""froze"". He didn't scream no and she forced herself. He said he didn't know if he was in the mood. And she could have taken that him saying he didn't know if he could get hard again. So she tried to rile him up. Its not predatory behavior by her. He was vague in everything he did. All he had to say was "" get the hell out the shower"" when she got in. "" Last night was a mistake"". Anything.

23172,lxnodnv,comment,,"In future when trying to figure out if someone is treating you well or not. Think about how you'd handle the situation if the roles were flipped. If you knew someone had been sexually assaulted, would you do what he did? 

If the answer is no. Then don't accept that behaviour.

When you've been abused, you're more likely to be abused. Because your idea of normal behaviour towards you is skewed. You normally know how to behave towards other people, but you will accept the most horrifying behaviour towards yourself. 

So you need to start thinking, would I do this. 

In terms of therapy, read up on manipulation. Narcissists, sociopaths and sadists. If you don't want to read, people have content out there about relationships with people like that. Go listen and learn. 

Sometimes, knowing that these people do this intentionally helps. It can help you because you'll be able to pick up the red flags earlier, too. The warning with this is to make sure you're not looking to fit everyone into those categories immediately. Context matters, and the severity and rate of problematic behaviour matters too.

You can look to see if people discuss healthy sex after being sexually abused and see if you can find people who have been in similar situations as you.

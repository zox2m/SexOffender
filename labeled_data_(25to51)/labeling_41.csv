And it's not irrelevant because you literally asked for a difference between racism and hating scene kids. I didn't defend anyone I only offered a difference. Why would you ask the question and then go all ""you're fucked up."" And all that jazz at someone who answers it??

Sincerely yours,

Mr. Bitches

I was unable to get an epidural or any pain meds and had a natural delivery. I had felt like my body had absolutely betrayed me. I struggle with self harm and SI so hurting myself is not an issue but I have to be in control of my own pain. Since I was not, it was not a pleasant postpartum journey for me. I have PTSD from my sexual traumas but I also believe i developed a form or ptsd from my delivery. 

Our bodies are wonderful but I felt like I had been betrayed by mine. Idk if that makes any sense at all but here we are.",7,,2025-01-05 04:11:53,t3_1htuip5,,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1htuip5/how_sa_effects_you_giving_birth_in_the_future/m5gydxm/,Victim

23897,ls6m5xn,comment,,"I want to say a couple of things.

1- God does **not** hate you or think badly of you because you are Queer. If you believe in God, God *made* you exactly as you are, and He does not despise the things He creates.

2- You’re not hypersexual, I promise. You’re experiencing 100% developmentally appropriate hormones and desires. The key to this is learning self control and when it is and is not appropriate, and what your boundaries are and how to uphold them.

3- It is very very common among women raised with Christian purity values to develop non consent kinks. There is a lot of conversation around it. And it has a lot to do with the way you’ve been taught to feel shame for having sexual desires. You’re not actually attracted to rape, you’re having sexual desires and are fantasizing about how to fulfill those desires without having to feel shame for them. Noncon allows you to indulge in the fantasy while also not feeling the shame because you didn’t have a choice. It doesn’t make you evil, it doesn’t mean you want to be raped. 

I know this feels scary and dangerous, but I promise you’re not the first fourteen year old queer girl who has experience these desires, they are unfortunately very very common. 

You are allowed to be queer. You are allowed to have sexual desires. You are allowed to explore those things. And God does not despise you for them. Remember, He *created* you. 

I highly highly recommend seeking out a trusted adult, maybe a school counselor or someone of the sort (who is NOT associated with the Church) to discuss the guilt and shame you’re experiencing and who can help you form healthy boundaries with sex.

23934,er2xye5,comment,,"For those of us with bad eyes:

 This will be long. This was years ago, and I don't care how I'm judged for this. If given the chance I would do it again a thousand times over. 

I'm 25 right now . When I was 4 my mother and father split . My mother is a horrible women. My father moved to Australia from New Zealand, got a job and a place in a few months, called my mum to tell her he would almost have everything ready for us to move over. He sent her over around 10,000 to pay the rest of the house we owned in NZ off so we could rent it out and use it as a source of income. My mother being the fucked up person she is, took the money , abandoned the house and ran away with us without telling my father . 

This fucked up our entire life, about a year after my dad finally managed to find her (he had to fly to NZ and hunt her down through family) My dad was so foolishly in love with my mother , he actually wanted to give her a chance . She declined and he sat us all down and asked us who we wanted to stay with as him and mum are split now . My siblings almost immediately opted to go with him if I wasn't so young and stupid I would have too but instead apparently, I was also foolish and felt sorry for mum so I said I wanted to stay with her. Biggest mistake of my life. My father had to pay my mum to take my siblings, this was a terrible idea. Mum was a drug addict, alcoholic dead beat. 

Fast forward about 4 years when I'm 9. I had the most fucked up childhood. Every day, parties , junkies and some new guy my mother was sleeping with or getting beaten almost to death by. She had been seeing the guy for about 3 or so months, let's call him Dirtbag. At the time I was young and naive, I really loved my mother but I hated the life she dragged me through. The abuse from strangers and junkies leaving all their needles and shit around. The stupid parties where random people would literally be having sex in my room while I was trying to sleep for school. Real messed up. 

After the police had gotten involved in an incident that put my mother in intensive care, my mother didn't want to press charges and still wanted to be with him !? He literally beat her within an inch of her life , and she still wanted to go back ? I don't know what happened. I felt dead inside. After all this, she still wanted to be a fucking bum ? It was at this point I saw my mother for who she really was. I had enough. I wasn't even 10 and I'd been exposed to the world in a way no child should be. 

So that day they sent me home , he was released and came back home. Now at the very least all he did was ignore me, but I think that was mainly because he was high on heroin. Once I knew he had just finished shooting up and would be down for an hour or so , I don't know what came over me. I wanted him to pay. Pay for my mother, for my life . I don't know I was just angry . So I planned and I knew what I was going to do to get my revenge ! 

Once he was down , I grabbed a club we had outside , and started to beat myself with it. To the point where I was really messed up I'd busted my nose , cut my lip , gave myself a swollen eye that came out of my face. I snapped the broomstick on my leg and managed to fracture my ankle. With blood pouring out of my nose and my face , I walked inside , placed the club and stick inside near him , but I was not finished there. This is the hardest part for me to admit because it's hard to come to terms with how far I was willing to go to get my revenge. I went to the bathroom , took my mum's deodorant, dropped my drawers and I'm sure you guys can imagine what I did next to the point where I bled. I limped downstairs , put the can near him as well. 

I waited around 10 minutes than called police, acted hysterical and told them I had been beaten and raped by my mother's parter who just got let go for beating my mother. In a matter of minutes and I mean minutes, police had swarmed the place, arrested him and we're taking me with them to the station. I had to tell them what had happened , so I made it all up . I told them after coming home and doing drugs he decided he would take his frustration out on me , beat me , put the spray can in me, and beat me more . The police were horrified . 

My dad was called and he flew over immediately. I'm not too sure what happened next a lot of it is a blur. But I ended up leaving the country with my dad, Dirtbag ended up in prison and I found out a year later he got served with a 32 year sentence. My mother got a 4 year sentence for neglect and child abuse since the police wanted to prosecute her for having left me in his care while she knew he was a drug addict and violent. The police barely dug, I don't know if thats because I was a kid and they just believed everything I said but it was really not hard to convince everyone he needed to go to jail. 

Until this day no one knows this except for my dad who I admitted it to when he came and got me from NZ . He said to me ""son I'm so sorry I didn't take you with me I wanted to give you the choice, but no matter what , you must never EVER tell anyone else this ok""? To this day it's our secret 😁 And just for clarification I'm male.. no it wasn't pleasant to do."," For those of us with bad eyes:

1) Have you actually raped anyone?
— no? Okay, so give yourself a big apology and let the panic of your feared inviability as a decent person subside.
2) Would you actually rape someone and feel good about it while you did it?
— no? Perhaps what you want is not to rape someone but to play out a power dynamic scenario within a healthy relationship.

You are not going to rape anyone. You are not going to rape anyone. You are not going to rape anyone.

Ethics in porn is something worth giving thought to. It might put your mind at ease to learn about the production companies’ practices. Kink.com has some nice cast interviews reassuring the viewer they are consenting actors, and they really go all out.

Sexuality and civilization have somehow coexisted for thousands of years. Human history shows us we have all kinds of capacities for different types of desires. We have also reached a greater consciousness about how our actions affect others and have thusly placed constraints on certain behaviors.

Instead of worrying so much about what you like, try to understand from an emotional place why you like it. If you had a loving, understanding, and willing partner, what would be the ultimate indulgence they could grant you that would reach that emotional place? There are perfectly healthy ways to express this fantasy and frankly, there are plenty of women who have a complimentary fantasy. Respect that not everyone does and you’re headed for healthy relationships. It can feel lonely and alienating to have a kink but it’s that much better when you find someone to share it with.

Valuing women as humans does not mean you won’t feel the strong sexual urge to subjugate and demean them. Valuing women does mean that you will talk to them about it first and see if they are similarly inclined before proceeding. Sexuality is weird and it might surprise you that this can actually do just as much for someone else as it does for you. Try to remember that you are a kind, considerate, caring person who does not really want to harm anyone and that it’s just a power dynamic that you find sexually intriguing.

24034,ejjpfli,comment,,"Well, I don't know you, and you don't know me. But it is just a matter of fact that the two of us are entirely different people. I believe the system in which we use to judge innocent or guilty, with the very rare, some what tertiary option, is an amazing system on paper. But in practice, it just doesn't work to the fullest that it is expected to. I don't think the state that which our justice operates is really important right now, so I won't continue on that topic.

I think deciding whether some one dies is actually a very simple decision. A man raped a child below the age of 10 years old; I will watch the life drain from him with glee. A woman suffocates her infant child, for simply ""it was too hard to take care of a kid"" even though she has full ability to give that child to a much more qualified parent(s); I will happily see to it her grave is properly engraved on time.

You may call me a ""lunatic"", psychopathic, sociopathic, sociopathiologically insane, or simply crazy. It won't keep me up at night.

I do have to say I disagree when you say it won't solve anything to kill a person. Even though it's a touchy topic, it's a good example: had Adolf Hitler not been defeated, by being over run, or from Russia's harshe winter, he could have very well taken over the world. If Great Britain hadn't been stopped by all the people who rebelled, they surely would have taken over the world- the quote ""The sun never sets on Great Britain"" became a thing for a reason. And in both of those, rather extreme, cases; People died. And it is a very sad, cold truth that we can't talk and agree all the time. Sometimes we will simply start mass killing one another. Now I wish we could stop going to war, I personally would love to see that, but knowing that isn't going to happen just because I wish upon a star, is something I accept and therefore know that killing some people, as disheartening as it may be, is just the answer. If we didn't kill the terrorists of the world, many more, innocent, people would die. If we didnt imprison, or execute, some criminals, more (innocent) people would die. 

But I do agree when you say justice is a strange word. But I dont think I agree in the same way. I feel it's strange because I feel the word itself, along with other words such as 'rape' and 'literally', have lost the meaning it is supposed to have. Resulting in people not knowing what justice really is. What is justice? Exact revenge?, when the person dies for killing another?, or what? I most certainly dont know, and that is what keeps me up at night. That we have clouded what we judge as right and wrong so bad, that we are no longer sure of what is right and wrong. "," Well, I don't know you, and you don't know me. But it is just a matter of fact that the two of us are entirely different people. I believe the system in which we use to judge innocent or guilty, with the very rare, some what tertiary option, is an amazing system on paper. But in practice, it just doesn't work to the fullest that it is expected to. I don't think the state that which our justice operates is really important right now, so I won't continue on that topic.

I think deciding whether some one dies is actually a very simple decision. A man raped a child below the age of 10 years old; I will watch the life drain from him with glee. A woman suffocates her infant child, for simply ""it was too hard to take care of a kid"" even though she has full ability to give that child to a much more qualified parent(s); I will happily see to it her grave is properly engraved on time.

You may call me a ""lunatic"", psychopathic, sociopathic, sociopathiologically insane, or simply crazy. It won't keep me up at night.

I do have to say I disagree when you say it won't solve anything to kill a person. Even though it's a touchy topic, it's a good example: had Adolf Hitler not been defeated, by being over run, or from Russia's harshe winter, he could have very well taken over the world. If Great Britain hadn't been stopped by all the people who rebelled, they surely would have taken over the world- the quote ""The sun never sets on Great Britain"" became a thing for a reason. And in both of those, rather extreme, cases; People died. And it is a very sad, cold truth that we can't talk and agree all the time. Sometimes we will simply start mass killing one another. Now I wish we could stop going to war, I personally would love to see that, but knowing that isn't going to happen just because I wish upon a star, is something I accept and therefore know that killing some people, as disheartening as it may be, is just the answer. If we didn't kill the terrorists of the world, many more, innocent, people would die. If we didnt imprison, or execute, some criminals, more (innocent) people would die. 

But I do agree when you say justice is a strange word. But I dont think I agree in the same way. I feel it's strange because I feel the word itself, along with other words such as 'rape' and 'literally', have lost the meaning it is supposed to have. Resulting in people not knowing what justice really is. What is justice? Exact revenge?, when the person dies for killing another?, or what? I most certainly dont know, and that is what keeps me up at night. That we have clouded what we judge as right and wrong so bad, that we are no longer sure of what is right and wrong.

Thinking that a crime or incident defines you is just more likely to push you into further pits of self doubt and self hatred which will more than likely lead to incidents or crimes just like the one that started the cycle. Growth requires change, and if we want to grow as a society we have to change how we treat people who commit crimes. Never forget what you did, never forget how it made you feel. If you hold onto that nugget of shame, you will forever be dissuaded from doing something like it again.

I have never seen a case in my life where a victim is punished for seeking justice.

In America today if someone is publicly accused of rape their lives are RUINED.

The hard truth here is that people like OP are *exactly* the type of people our justice system should actually be focusing on. So by your logic, to fix the justice system we would have to start prosecuting and institutionalizing people who commit actual heinous acts, like OP.

Yes, the justice system is unfair to minorities and people using relatively harmless drugs like weed. Yes, people like OP are the ones that the justice system needs to be going after. But no, I don't care.

The woman has not reported it. If the woman **does** report it, fair game, he should do his time and get on with his life. If she never reports it, then it does not matter. Again, this is fucking r/confession for crying out loud. Half the people on here are likely just people who just get off to being talked down to and another fourth is people with anxiety and over-active guilt and conscience complexes. I genuinely find it hard to believe every case on here is legitimate. If the girl wanted to pursue legal action she would. And if she does not pursue any legal actions out of some misguided emotion towards OP, that is her fault. If she wants OP to rot in jail, she should report it and show them the evidence (i.e. the text where he confirmed it). If the girl is stupid enough to not report it, its her own fault. Look, I know its a sensitive and touchy subject, I know people get super heated and let their emotions lead them by the nose with this kind of thing. But again, I don't care. His actions were dangerous enough to prosecute. And indeed, if she were to report it, I would support her going after OP with the full extent of the law. Rape is a very serious and horrible crime. But unless she takes that step to report it, there is no reason to turn yourself in. I wish that OP will never do something like this again, and I hope that rape never has to happen again in the entire world. But I also wish for a million bucks. Wishing for something and simply getting upset when it doesn't happen will  get you nowhere. 

I will acknowledge that I have my own issues, and I will admit that it causes me to be biased in a lot of situations. I don't really feel remorse for most of my actions, I don't seriously care about the emotions of most other people, and I don't care about people I don't know. So, ill say it again, I don't really care about this thread or the issue being discussed. I can't even be sure it actually happened. All I am saying is that OP does not need to turn himself into the police because OP is under no obligation to. If he wants to, thats fine. I can understand that a clear conscience is the best pillow. But again, unless the woman presses charges there isn't a valid or objective reason as to why OP should throw himself in prison. I hate rapists just as much as the next guy, and i've even known some people who have been violated. And each time, the women (and guy in one case) reported it with all the evidence needed, each time they prosecuted the people responsible and were able to get them punished. But until the woman makes that step to turn him in, I can't find a reason to say he should. If I were in his shoes, I wouldn't turn myself in. I would seek mental help and then probably move far away and clear my head, try to forget all about it.

I get it, OP *should* turn himself in. But, he won't. Because he knows that it will only hurt him. He knows that going to jail would stop him from doing the things he wants to do, he knows that he wont be able to go watch the new movies coming out, watch his favorite T.V. shows and go to the bar on Fridays.

You found him intoxicated, you seduced him when he was vulnerable and did not have the legal capacity to give consent.

However, I do not consider this a criminal act either. It's a horrible fucking misunderstanding. It's clear that your trauma, likely compounded with your own intoxication, made you insensitive to the specifics of what was going on. I doubt you realized that you were taking advantage of the situation, and nowhere near cognizant of the way you may have been hurting him. I don't really know the shape it should take, but a mediated space where he could air his trauma, let you know how you impacted him, and wherein you could offer a sincere apology, explain what you have learned, and demonstrate how you will conduct yourself with more care and consideration in the future, seems a more reasonable course of action. I'd suggest some sort of sealed record would be needed, because a mediated, non-criminal response can't be used to just get serial offenders off the hook, but it seems more productive for society as a whole in this type of situation, regardless of gender dynamics."," This is exactly why the law is a poor mechanism for dealing with sexual assault.

Pressure = coercion = force = rape. Also, your relationship with someone ahead of the incident does not in any way factor into whether or not you raped them. Spousal rape is a thing.

24142,1i5pedb,post,"31M - confused about AM, work, life. Everything is just foggy in my head."," 

I'm from India and arranged marriages are still common here  (I hope you'd Google it if you don't know about it)

I'm probably gonna get a lot of flake about how am I living my life, but I'll try to type it all.


As of today, my parents are trying to set me up with a girl. I met her twice - once when their family came to our house. Second time outside in a cafe after 2 weeks. We didn't talk in between those two meetings. After last time, she asked for my number and that she's ready to take it forward and say he's to our arrangement and indirectly said she is ready for the roka ceremony. I told her it's something that's too early for me to decide, I need to get to know the person and talk atleast for a while to decide if I want to spend the rest of my life with her. Now she texted me that she can ask her parents to meet up one more time (we live in a different city so I'd have to travel to her city). Just one more and then I'll have to decide. 

After meeting her, I felt she's a nice girl, sweet and simple. You could call het the type that mothers like. But I don't yet feel that I can decide if she can be my life partner. There's also multiple other reaons for this which I'll write down.

Growing up, even though I got good grades, I wasn't very smart. I took science and enrolled into engineering only to find it extremely difficult. I never thought sbotj the future or what I'd do after college. When the college was over, I only had one thing in my mind that I don't want to do go for a job, I'll start a business eventually. I worked in commerce for 10 months year at a relative's firm to learn about it and then I left to start something of my own. It took 8-9 months more before I started a chocolate business. I started this one because one of my cousin bhaiya has a big chocolate trading business in the south and he suggested me to start selling candies under my own brand and he'd give a big jump start. The day I started business, i found that we made a big calculation mistake and the price at which I was getting my product is the price i was supposed to sell the product to him. Even so, he tried to help me. And the way I was doing it was just sitting at home, cold calling buyers through indiamart sometimes and try to get some orders. Covid hit and I had run losses, couldn't make a sale, lot of dead stock piled up so I closed the business.

Then, post covid I thought I try gifitng business with gift of chocolates which are really good and high grade. I spend quite some money on it's marketing. The response was good but many said the price point was high. My father told me to get a shop and inculde various other gift items and gifts for events as well. We did find one and rented it. Paid 6 months rent and brokerage. Idk how or why or what happened but I got extremely pessimistic about it. Idk if I'd call it depression but I lost my appetite, lost any interest in doing anything would just overthink all day, lost confidence, wouldn't talk to anybody and mu family could see that I'm forcing myself to do it. They told me to drop it and let it go and just be your old self again, you can try for a different business idea. I did that and the next two months I didn't know what to do. So my father called me back to our hometown (I lived with my uncle in a different city) and asked to learn about tne business that my father does (he's a small working partner at a business) and then start something related to it. That's the only option now. So I went back and I hate that I hated living there. I hadn't lived there in 16 years. It's a really small town, where I have no friends and no life. But I felt a little free for now. Started going to the office with dad and try to learn. I had become kind of an introvert by now, idk why. But I didn't like talking to people. It's probably because I felt ashamed that I was now 28 years old and still didn't achieve anything in life.  

15 months into living back in hometown I found out that my gf had been cheating on me with my best friend back in the other city. That's such a big story and that I can't type it here. I found out they had been doing it for a while, saw photos, chats, videos which scarred me a lot. I was lost all the time now. Was in clinical depression but I couldn't talk to anyone about it. It's how I came to reddit to talk to strangers about it in 2022. I feel like  I don't have any memories of 4 months post finding out about them except their chats and the feeling that I had at that time. I became numb and my family thought I was extremely worried about work (which I was) but this one thing thar happened it felt it it pushed me over the edge of a cliff when i was standing safe, pretty far away and I was okay. To this day, it's been difficult for me to trust people, to not overthink  sometimes and just get anxiety. The only thing that helps is going to the gym. Started working out last year and been consistent.It's the one single thing that's keeping me sane it's why I never miss it.


I couldn't live in my hometown anymore because even after 2 years I just hater living there. Decided to come back to the city and start an extention of business that my father does. Started with  one of the products which I couldn't source at good rates. I didn't even work it I know that, and even today after 1.5 years now, I say I am doing a business but in reality I'm just at home all day, hoping something will work out.

My family has decent money (probably between middle and upper middle class) and I know that's no reason and I don't know what's stopping me. I don't know how to get out of this negetive mindset of thinking this won't work or that won't work or I don't know what to do. I lie to all my friends, relatives, and everyone that I'm now doing okay I'm business amd earing okay when I know I am not.

I am not able to change my midnset that I have, i don't know how to make myself work. I just keep worrying about future, live frugally, take money from home. I live like a kid in college. And among all this, my family wants to me get married saying ""sab ho jaaega"". The girl and her family doesn't know about this, that I am yet not earning. My family worried about my age and frankly there haven't been many marriage proposals. It had been a while and now they want to be done with it kyuki shayad aage aaye na aaye.

With how I am, I can't make anyone who's with me suffer. I don't know how to handle this situation. I would rather not get married and make a girl who leaves everything behind to live with someone else suffer. Just a rant maybe hoping for some advice or someone who's been through something. 

Anyone who meets me thinks I'm this jolly happy person, doing quite good in life. If I feel sad and anxious some day I have got really good at hiding it, enough that even my brothers cannot see it. There are days when I feel it would have been better if I just didn't exist - all because I feel like big ass failure and idk why am I not doing anything to change it.","31M - confused about AM, work, life. Everything is just foggy in my head.  

I'm from India and arranged marriages are still common here  (I hope you'd Google it if you don't know about it)

I'm probably gonna get a lot of flake about how am I living my life, but I'll try to type it all.


As of today, my parents are trying to set me up with a girl. I met her twice - once when their family came to our house. Second time outside in a cafe after 2 weeks. We didn't talk in between those two meetings. After last time, she asked for my number and that she's ready to take it forward and say he's to our arrangement and indirectly said she is ready for the roka ceremony. I told her it's something that's too early for me to decide, I need to get to know the person and talk atleast for a while to decide if I want to spend the rest of my life with her. Now she texted me that she can ask her parents to meet up one more time (we live in a different city so I'd have to travel to her city). Just one more and then I'll have to decide. 

After meeting her, I felt she's a nice girl, sweet and simple. You could call het the type that mothers like. But I don't yet feel that I can decide if she can be my life partner. There's also multiple other reaons for this which I'll write down.

Growing up, even though I got good grades, I wasn't very smart. I took science and enrolled into engineering only to find it extremely difficult. I never thought sbotj the future or what I'd do after college. When the college was over, I only had one thing in my mind that I don't want to do go for a job, I'll start a business eventually. I worked in commerce for 10 months year at a relative's firm to learn about it and then I left to start something of my own. It took 8-9 months more before I started a chocolate business. I started this one because one of my cousin bhaiya has a big chocolate trading business in the south and he suggested me to start selling candies under my own brand and he'd give a big jump start. The day I started business, i found that we made a big calculation mistake and the price at which I was getting my product is the price i was supposed to sell the product to him. Even so, he tried to help me. And the way I was doing it was just sitting at home, cold calling buyers through indiamart sometimes and try to get some orders. Covid hit and I had run losses, couldn't make a sale, lot of dead stock piled up so I closed the business.

DISCLAIMER WE ARE ALL OKAY NOW!! we got put into foster care eventually. but my dad was very abusive like i would watch him bring my brother into his room with his belt in his hand and me and my sister would just hear my brother screaming and crying and we would just have to sit in my room together and listen. but if we got caught crying we would get a punishment ourselves. my dad was also sexually really weird he would sleep naked on the couch and force me and my siblings to shower with him and sleep in his bed with him while he was naked. one time something bad happened and i was in his room with him and my brother and i don’t remember what happened but the tv literally fell off of the wall mount. and somehow it was me and my brother’s fault even though we were just sitting on the floor playing. so we got into a lot of trouble. he started yelling and throwing stuff and then he told us that he needed to come up with a punishment for us. he made us get in the shower together, which was a normal thing at the time because he always made all three of us bathe with each other and he would watch and it was really weird now that i’m really thinking about all this stuff. anyways he put us in the shower together and then instructed my brother to kiss me. not just a peck on the lips, he told my brother to put me against the wall and like make out with me. i was 8 and my brother was 10 and that’s really weird that he wanted us to do that but my brother didn’t he refused and then my dad broke a glass on the floor and told my brother he’d have to walk over the glass if he didn’t do it. so my brother did it, so i got pushed against the wall and my brother was putting his tongue in my mouth and then my dad told me that if i wasn’t “into it” i’d have to walk over the glass. so i had to kiss him back and that’s all that happened, he made us kiss for like 15 minutes but then my little sister came in and said she was hungry, so he told me to make her something and my brother to clean up the glass. and it was really weird and we never talked about it ever again and it really really traumatized me and i think about it a lot and it makes me feel like i want to throw up. and it’s really hard for me to have sex sometimes like if i make out with someone too long i lowkey have a break down and i hate my father for this and i hate that i can’t be normal but he’s in jail now and we are all safe. i just needed to get it off my chest.","something weird happened when i was a kid and i  still think about it nearly every day for content when this event happened i was probably 8/9. anyways i was living with my dad and my two other siblings, an older brother and younger sister. my sister is 3 years younger than me and my brother is 2 years older than me. my dad was very abusive.

People suck sometimes. They're probably caught up in their own lives or problems - it's not a reflection on you. We all deserve to feel special and appreciated and valued so I'm sorry no one's made you fee that way. But don't take permanent action to a temporary problem. What if in a month you meet the love of your life? Or you find your closest friend group in a year? You can't count on it but you don't know what the future brings.

Why not go to the concert alone? I've done that plenty times before because no one liked my music! Try to do things for yourself. Take care of yourself. Do things that make you happy not for anyone else. 

Also fuck anyone who makes fun of your vitiligo. I had an ex with it and I thought it was beautiful. Also I'm sorry about your parents. I know how hurtful favouritism is. But don't underestimate how much you mean to people. People would miss you if were gone (and if you do go, you won't ever get to see that... only if you talk to them and be honest about how you're feeling!)

Anyway, stay alive stranger. (And it's cliche on reddit, but do reach out to a helpline and/or a therapist, they can really help with self-esteem and relationship difficulties). It'll be ok in the end and if it's not okay, it's not the end!"," Happy Birthday!

I'm sure if you went out of your way to help someone who really needed it, they'd appreciate it, or, they should. They might not. Because humans are assholes. 

One thing I've learned in life is to truly examine your motives for your actions. To me it sounds as if you're motivation is to gain love and adoration from the  people in your life. It's a very self-centered motivation. Try living your life in service of others; and while most people still wont appreciate you, the ones that do will let you know, and those are the people you should try and build friendships with.

You should not worry at all what people think of you, only what you think about yourself, clearly you're letting your own preconceived notions of how others see you influence how you see yourself. You need to disregard any thoughts that revolve around the thoughts/motivations of others. Focus on being a better person who adds value to other peoples lives.

Just stay. Ride it out. Don't leave. It's hard. It sucks. I really, really know where you are coming from. Try and find joy or peace in small things. 

Think of what you will miss. Pets? Favorite music (Coldplay, I assume 😉), food? Scents?

 I mean, not to scare ya, but nobody is 100% certain what happens 'next'. 

I read somewhere (have no idea where)

""You are not a human having a spiritual experience, rather a spirit having a human experience.""

Stuck with me... cause, like, I absolutely LOVE Dutch apple pie, warmed, with some vanilla ice cream. What if the 'spirit' can't taste? My dog is my best friend, he can't come with me. The scent of fresh pine is SO amazing, what if the 'spirit' can't smell?Think about Coldplay. What if the spirit can't hear?

These stupid, weird, fragile spirit-mobiles (bodies), are what enables us to have ALL of those experiences and more. Unfortunately, the bad stuff comes with it, too. 

Try re-framing. If you are sad, instead of saying ""I'm sad."" Train yourself to think ""I'm EXPERIENCING sadness."" And ask yourself what else you are experiencing at the same time. Being depressed or sad doesn't have to be the ONLY experience you are having in any given moment.

Much love to you. Chin up, fellow soul who wants chuck the meatsuit and dissappear into the ether. (I'm not gonna though, cause I'd be so pissed if I just end up a floating spec that can't eat pie, listen to music, garden, pet my dog, smell the roses...you get it!)"," First, Happy Birthday!!

But please hang in there. The world needs you to stay because we are short on good caring people so you can’t go anywhere. Go to that damn concert and make friends once you get there! You will already have one thing in common with whoever you meet cause they obviously like Coldplay as much as you do so that gives you a little something to chat about. You have absolutely nothing to lose! (Sneak in a THC pen or some booze and you’re guaranteed to be popular at the concert if you share 😂) Post your tickets on Facebook and take whoever comments. You have so many options if you just take things one hour at a time. I hope you find some takers on your b day shindig.

 before your roll your eyes and scroll away as if im the Nigerian prince in need of money hear me out

I have enjoyed such a profound change in my mental health, career, and personal life  i cant help but look back and think how did i get here. how did i change from who i was to this happy grateful and capable person i am today. 

And all i want to do is share what ive learned  because happiness is attainable. and i can show you where to find it

 but i'm actually on a mission to find the broken, the gifted yet tortured, and the hopeless and invite them to join my team. 

ticktock is being done away with on sunday sadly and im creating a new community on a different platform called bump social

I know everyone has opinions about social media and aps, many scoff at hypnosis and no one in this frame of mind  believes that  the  power to change and to heal is already inside them. 

But i do.

The dream team has no membership fees, no requirements we just provide the place to share. a support group  with a collection of tools to help you on your journey to peace and happiness.  and i get the pleasure of knowing that i am helping others and making the world a better place. 

Right now you are not your number one priority. i know this. so dont do it for you. give me a chance to prove that this works , please do it for me. 

due to the new platform you are my first invitation. aka my first follower , potentially my favorite and most important person ever. doing this for you will change your life

it  will also validate mine..

They stopped calling because no longer was I the life of the party, I was the burden now, in a wheelchair that would be more trouble that my company would be worth. Guess what, if they were really my friends, they would be right here by my side right now but their not. I could have went off the Deep in and threw the towel in but you know what I did instead? I found me some real friends that introduced me to some other people and now, I've got so many people in my life. Supportive, Caring people.
 You know what, consider me your friend..Happy 28th Birthday brother. I along with a lot of other people right here will be your support factor. Life is far to precious to let go of. Just when you think you've reached the lowest point in your life is when things start happening for you. But, it's not going to fall in your lap.. you're going to have to put forth some effort. At 28, there is a fire burning in you and it wants out. You got your entire life ahead of you to figure it out. But, not if you choose to do something crazy. You've got people right here that you don't know but many of us have been right where you believe you are now. Pick yourself up brother, stand tall and get out and meet new people. Go beyond your comfort level with the confidence that I know is in you. You can achieve greatness and enjoy the luxuries of it throughout life. The first step to getting past this point is reaching out and asking for help. Help to learn some coping skills and how to accomplish tasks that are going to open up doors for you.

Through all the odds, you managed to make it this far. You are 1 in 8 billion. The odds were against any of us ever being born, yet the right people came together at the right time. You won the lottery and are here, right now, breathing. You made it. And in addition? Every obstacle, every hurt, every cut, bruise, or harsh word that's come your way hasn't stopped you yet. And for that, you are so, so strong!! Right now you may feel weak and alone. Like nobody wants you or that you're broken. It couldn't be farther from the truth. You are seen and loved more than you could ever hope to know. I've been in dark places where I felt like nobody knew me enough to care, but somehow, after holding out long enough, I came to know people who REALLY cared. My perspective on what love even was shattered and I felt like I finally belonged. I believe with all that I am that this can happen for you too. You've made it this far. Please, please don't give up now. Please enjoy this wonderful gift of life. Enjoy the sunset, a good cup of tea, a warm hug. I know there may not be anyone who can fulfill that warm hug right now but please trust me when I say that if you hold out long enough, love WILL find you. And when it does, you will never be alone again. You are so, so loved. I don't know what you believe about how we got here or why we're here, and I'm not here to stuff my beliefs down your throat, but it's my belief that there's a God and he wants to call you his despite anything you may view as an imperfection or shortcoming in yourself. You are loved. Known. Wanted. If you keep looking, you will find love. I promise. Please, please don't give up.

May you experience a long life full of the joys and wonders of love, and every good thing the world has to offer. May you find a steadfast friend who will never leave your side or give up on you. May you find hope and peace and rest."," First of all, happy birthday! 🎈

Recently, I asked for my hair to be cut to my shoulders and for my bangs to be trimmed straight across. When she was done cutting, I put on my glasses and she says ""I thought it would look better if we went shorter than your shoulders and gave you side swept bangs!"" So my hair is a good 2+ inches shorter than I wanted and now it doesn't fit in a ponytail, which I explicitly told her I needed it to.

Please take care of yourself during this time. It’s okay to feel broken, and it’s okay to grieve. Healing takes time, so be patient with yourself.

I believe she’d want you to find happiness again, even if it feels impossible right now. Living your life doesn’t mean letting go of her—it means carrying her memory with you as you move forward.

Consider surrounding yourself with people who care about you. Maybe join a support group or try volunteering when you’re ready. It might help to connect with others who understand what you’re going through.

Wishing you strength and sending all my thoughts your way. Please don’t give up—you’re not alone in this."," Hey man, I’m truly sorry to hear about your loss. I can’t even begin to imagine how heavy this must be for you.

The one thing I can tell you is suicide is not the answer.  I have stared into that abyss...it is so inviting to think the pain will stop. 

What saved me from stepping off the cliff where I was looking at the rocks at the bottom and imagining my head breaking open, was remembering that I had people that would have to deal with my death.  The EMS and police.   My husband, my family (although we weren't particularly close), and the few friends that I have.

I remembered a friend whose ex hanged himself in a garage.  She had left him for a lot of reasons, but felt guilty about him ending his life.  His kids were traumatised.  His sister, who found him, was broken for a long time.  

The abyss beckons, but it lies.  It wants to prevent you from going on, from living, from experiencing happiness.... It spreads despair and grief like it is giving out candy.   

It takes time to heal.  Please give yourself the gift of living.  Give yourself the ability to remember and cherish those funny times you shared.

Please seek out help.  You are not alone.

When my best friend died it felt like I wanted to go with him. He was my brother and confidante. Losing someone from the family you choose hurts more than I can describe.

Focus on taking it one day at a time for now. You're in therapy and that's great. Keep going to work/school and don't forget the reason why you're there: for a better life. Even if she's not around anymore, she would want you to carry on, because she loved you, truly. 

Try to keep busy, and when you're ready, I advise you to move to a new place, maybe a flat share with other people so you'll make new friends.

He willingly takes his medications now, willingly bathes and even works at the physical therapies/rehab to where he can now dress himself, get himself in and out of bed and in and out of his wheelchair. They have decided he's better off there and she's improving in health and well being daily.

OP please give yourself permission to put yourself first. Take care of you now. You shouldn't continue to wear yourself out for his well being when he shows you again and again he doesn't care about your well being much less his own.

I hope you can reach a point where you can find comfort in each other's presence again, but that isn't a guarantee. I am so sorry that you are in this situation, but you have to make the best choice for both of your physical AND mental health, and long-term care will be that.

You also say you don't have any financial resources. The people at ""A Place For Mom"" or a neurology hospital social worker might be able to help you navigate this in your area, but be prepared to 1)either divorce to protect any assets you DO have, like a house, and/or 2)have to surrender his care to the State.

It's my belief women do not ever have a fair chance at not being sexualised. 

A few years ago I went on a work night out hitting clubs and bars etc... we got to this one bar and I hit it off instantly with this one girl, but I immediately let her know I was in a relationship, it was just a casual one but a relationship none the less.

About 30 or so minutes later I check my phone and that girl messaged me to say she was home safe, I felt relieved and happy. Because I know what men are like, how they think and just how disgusting the majority of men can be. I never spoke to her again after that night, didn't need to.

It genuinely made me feel so crazy? I couldn't believe I was even in that siutation. She had gone as far to tell me that my friend who was raped by him was lying... but there were multiple witnesses. My friend who was raped was literally found passed out drunk in the back of a car with her pants down, and he later admitted to her he did have sex with her that night. I told her all of us just for her to say she thinks my friend is lying... I was like okay but why are there two other situations hes been involved with where hes raping or sexually assaulting others.

18915,lydblnx,comment,,"It's interesting that you say this. The men in my life (I'm a woman) often express that the camaraderie they have with men feels superficial. The second they're vulnerable, they're mocked. I have a partner, and my best friend is male. Both have social circles, careers, siblings/fathers. One suspects he's autistic but doesn't dare confide in any male friends. One was sexually assaulted as a child and has been outright ostracized and degraded, and now won't discuss it with anyone but partners.

I'm not suggesting that your experience is wrong, because it can't be. But as a woman who goes out of her way to make the men in my life feel safe so that they can be vulnerable, this narrative doesn't fit. I've been with my partner for about 2 years, and prior to that I was dating around. The amount of unprocessed trauma, repressed sexual assault, self loathing misogyny was UNREAL.

On a first date, a man told me he didn't believe in rape culture, which pissed me off, so I gently unpacked it with him for a minute. He claimed he didn't know any women who had been sexually assaulted. Because his friends and sisters hadn't told him that they had been sexually assaulted. Like bro, on a first date, you told me you didn't believe in rape culture. You're not the kind of person women feel safe confiding in. I gently explained that I actually didn't know a single woman who hasn't been sexually assaulted. As we went on, he exclaimed that based on my definition of rape, a highschool teacher of his having sex with him (even though he didn't really want to) was rape. YEAH DUDE, IT WAS.

I don't know. I'm seeing a lot of men struggling and feeling isolated and repressed, and I'm sad."," It's interesting that you say this.

I know that the pain you feel is unbearable and the only tip I know is to distract yourself as much as you can, force yourself to do stuff as much as you can even if you don't want to, or even watch a movie or series or read a book, whatever helps you get out of your reality. If you have people that you can ask for help, tell them what's going on and maybe you can ask them for help with cleaning, food prepping and stuff. I'm sure they would be happy to help and would prefer doing that than losing you. It would also help if you're able to change as much as you can about your space and your looks, if you are able to paint the walls a different colour, getting new furniture or if you can't afford that you can just place what you have in a different place or ask people you know or some business for furniture that they don't want anymore. Also changing your hairstyle in a radical way, experimenting with makeup and cloth styles, listening to very different music. 
I don't really think you want your life to end, you just want your life as you know it, to end, you want everything to be different, so do that. Make changes to feel like you are not that person anymore, you're not in the same place and you get a fresh start. Ask people for help, even if you barely know them. Show how you feel, not only it will help you get that off of your chest but you'll find people that feels the same way or have been through this, and finding a community is very helpful for all of the people involved. Maybe there are some group therapies in your area? Obviously a personal therapy too, but the group ones are important as it makes you realise that you're not the only one going through this and you can help each other. Sometimes when you're feeling like this is way easier to try to help others than helping yourself, so if you meet someone that's also struggling idk with meal prepping, maybe you feel you're able to do that for them and try to help them even if you can't do it for yourself, and they can do the same for you. Look out for help, because there is many people that cares even if they don't know you. Many people have been in your place and they don't want anyone to go through that again so they will be really happy to help you. There are also associations of family members of people that took the path you wanna take, and they feel that they could have done things differently and save them so now they look for people in that situation to make it up for what they couldn't do with their person. That would be helpful for both of you, because you'll get help and a support system and they'll get the chance to not mess things up this time and help someone in the name of their person, they couldn't save them but they can save you. 
It's very hard to do things for yourself when you're feeling this way so maybe thinking about doing this to give them that opportunity can help you. 
Make big changes in your life, I mean if you're looking to off yourself it wouldn't change much to give it a try before doing that. Don't think much about your life right know, think about how you'd like your life to be if you haven't been through this and how you'd look if you weren't scared to live. Get a punk haircut, tattoo your whole body, I don't care, make it all look the way you want to. Start again. Make it feel different. Remember that what you want is everything as you know it to end, not your life to end. So do that. Cut off the people that don't add to your life, even if they ""need you"", if you're dead they won't have you anyway so there's no point in keeping in touch with them.

Sometimes when you're feeling like this is way easier to try to help others than helping yourself, so if you meet someone that's also struggling idk with meal prepping, maybe you feel you're able to do that for them and try to help them even if you can't do it for yourself, and they can do the same for you. Look out for help, because there is many people that cares even if they don't know you. Many people have been in your place and they don't want anyone to go through that again so they will be really happy to help you. There are also associations of family members of people that took the path you wanna take, and they feel that they could have done things differently and save them so now they look for people in that situation to make it up for what they couldn't do with their person. That would be helpful for both of you, because you'll get help and a support system and they'll get the chance to not mess things up this time and help someone in the name of their person, they couldn't save them but they can save you. 
It's very hard to do things for yourself when you're feeling this way so maybe thinking about doing this to give them that opportunity can help you. 
Make big changes in your life, I mean if you're looking to off yourself it wouldn't change much to give it a try before doing that. Don't think much about your life right know, think about how you'd like your life to be if you haven't been through this and how you'd look if you weren't scared to live. Get a punk haircut, tattoo your whole body, I don't care, make it all look the way you want to. Start again. Make it feel different. Remember that what you want is everything as you know it to end, not your life to end. So do that. Cut off the people that don't add to your life, even if they ""need you"", if you're dead they won't have you anyway so there's no point in keeping in touch with them. Act as if you have died and you're starting again but at your age. Give yourself a second chance.",2,,2025-01-15 0:41,t3_1i1iyzh,,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1i1iyzh/i_feel_like_ending_myself/m76zd6n/,Neutral

Here's a real simple way to determine if you cheated (and if you don't know the answer before you ask, then you know damn well you cheated): tell your current boyfriend that you fucked your ex, but you can't remember because you were really drunk, and you're having a hard time determining if what you did was cheating.

You’ve been incredibly generous already, and it’s not wrong to ask for what you’re owed, especially since you’re facing your own financial pressures.

Helping family is important, but it’s also important to recognize that you have your own needs, too. You did what you could to support your uncle when he was struggling, and now, with your own situation being uncertain, it’s perfectly reasonable to ask for that money back when you need it.

It's clear that you care a lot about your family and their struggles, and I’m sure your uncle understands how hard it is for you right now. You don’t have to feel guilty for setting boundaries and asking for what is rightfully yours. Money can be a tricky thing, especially when it comes to family, but you’re not being selfish—you’re just making sure that you can take care of yourself too.

Maybe in your next conversation, you can continue to express your understanding of his situation while also making it clear that you need to get the money back as soon as possible. You could say something like:

*""I really understand that you’ve had a tough year, and I want to be supportive. But I’m in a position now where I really need to have that money back. I know things are hard, but I would really appreciate it if we could arrange a plan to get it back sometime soon.""*

That way, you’re still being compassionate, but you’re also looking out for yourself. It’s okay to put yourself first sometimes, and your uncle will likely appreciate your honesty."," First of all, it’s completely understandable that you’re feeling bad about asking for the money back, but it’s also okay to prioritize your own well-being, especially when you’re in a tough spot yourself. You’ve been incredibly generous already, and it’s not wrong to ask for what you’re owed, especially since you’re facing your own financial pressures.

Helping family is important, but it’s also important to recognize that you have your own needs, too. You did what you could to support your uncle when he was struggling, and now, with your own situation being uncertain, it’s perfectly reasonable to ask for that money back when you need it.

The reason he’s so good at it, is because these people are unwelcome everywhere. Nobody likes or tolerated pedofiles and they are in physical danger if people find them out. They also never have access to any children to abuse if the parents don’t trust them. 

So you know what happens…. They spend their entire life convincing people they’re a good person.

I strongly strongly imagine that this person thinks you have forgotten and that’s the only reason they’re so nice to you, so you doubt any memories and go “no that can’t be right”, because this is a survival technique for them. They aren’t nice or good people.

18986,m2c6gs0,comment,,"Honestly you don’t know the reasons why they stopped.

It might have been the first and only time they acted on it. Still makes them bad.

It might have been the only time they did it to a relative and normally they only hurt children who don’t know them personally. 

Your parents might have been too present and watching you too carefully and they felt it too risky (this is the most likely reason IMO). 

They might only hurt children much younger to be sure that you don’t remember

I’m not trying to convince you he’s a bad person, even tho it might seem that way, I’m just trying to let you know that none of it has any impact on your innocence in the situation.

None of it makes it any less legitimately upsetting for you. 

They were the bad person, they never apologised, you have no idea how many times before or after you that they’d done this to people, but once is enough to cause harm. 

Look how it impacts you now. When the person chose to do this, they knew it would have long term negative impacts on the people they did it to, and they did it anyway. They called you into that bed. They planned it from even before that, it was just the first opportunity they had where they felt safe to risk it. These are not the actions of a good person, even if it was once.

I hope you know my messages are meant with kindness, I feel like you’re carrying some ownership in the situation and there’s none to be held by you, you are 100% innocent, you could have climbed into bed not realising, and tempted them and they gave in only once… they’re still bad for acting and you’re still innocent because you were an unknowing child with no power in the situation.

Imagine if this was like a discussion about infidelity … and you were giving a friend advice and their husband cheated by inviting an adult woman into their bed and then doing sexual acts.



You wouldn’t think.. oh well it was only once and he’s a nice guy. You’d think… he made a choice to cheat on his wife. He had options to not cheat, and he encouraged it and was the instigator.. you wouldn’t make excuses when you saw your friend hurt by this, you’d tell them their husband was morally wrong and was a bad husband, and doesn’t care about who they hurt.

The only difference is that in this situation, the other person was a consenting adult who was receptive to the sexual acts.

If the woman was for example… fast asleep. You’d think this husband was even worse, and dangerous! You’d think the other woman was innocent…

Now in your situation you were a literal child. There’s no way on this earth you had any blame in this. It might be hard to accept that this person wanted to hurt you, but it’s more that they just did not value or care about what impact it would have on you. Only in themselves. Which is what makes them a bad person.

It’s on both of you.

19050,m0c0hje,comment,,"Yeah the rape comment was a horrible thing to say. It’s unfortunately impossible to be taken seriously as a man who’s been SA’d. Society’s view is that you should have enjoyed it which makes my blood boil over.

I’d say that even though you still fear for your safety, experience uncomfortable encounters and receive some judgement for what you eat, the pressure is exacerbated for most woman. It’s not that men don’t have these gripes, but for women the nature of it is a little different and frequency/intensity is boosted. From the ages of 12-23, sexual harassment was a daily experience for me (only change is that now I (am 26) WFH at a non-toxic company and don’t really go out in public or interact with people outside my close circle anymore lol).

Moreover, 99% of men are able to physically overpower me by merit of testosterone alone. Even if they were 5’4, unarmed and skinny as anything. For most men there’s at least some proportion of other men you might be able to beat or take on in a fair fight. Also the nature of the fear is a little different- you’re more likely to fear being beaten up than also raped (not saying the risk is zero mind you and both risk profiles suck, but they are a bit different).

Regarding toxic gender norms about men e.g. not being allowed to have feelings, it just goes to show how these issues affect us all and we should all be working together to fight the problem instead of making it a men vs women stupid gender wars thing. Especially the comments about mens violence - after all, the biggest victims of men’s violence is other men. It’s an issue that matters to us all."," Yeah the rape comment was a horrible thing to say. It’s unfortunately impossible to be taken seriously as a man who’s been SA’d. Society’s view is that you should have enjoyed it which makes my blood boil over.

I’d say that even though you still fear for your safety, experience uncomfortable encounters and receive some judgement for what you eat, the pressure is exacerbated for most woman. It’s not that men don’t have these gripes, but for women the nature of it is a little different and frequency/intensity is boosted. From the ages of 12-23, sexual harassment was a daily experience for me (only change is that now I (am 26) WFH at a non-toxic company and don’t really go out in public or interact with people outside my close circle anymore lol).

Moreover, 99% of men are able to physically overpower me by merit of testosterone alone. Even if they were 5’4, unarmed and skinny as anything. For most men there’s at least some proportion of other men you might be able to beat or take on in a fair fight. Also the nature of the fear is a little different- you’re more likely to fear being beaten up than also raped (not saying the risk is zero mind you and both risk profiles suck, but they are a bit different).

That’s not tolerance—that’s apathy dressed up as moral relativism.

And yeah, people believe what they’re taught. But here’s the thing: we’re not in those 'environments' anymore. People in the West have access to different perspectives, education, and freedoms.

I am only a year and a half away from applying to pre-med, and there are barely any viable options for me at my high school. It drives me crazy. I walk into class and people complain over and over again about how our school doesn't support the arts or humanities... when we have bloody ART HISTORY as a subject and don't have a subject as basic or universal as health. Who on earth is taking art history? Every assembly, every student council meeting, every chapel service (we are a Protestant single-sex school) is about how we need support for the arts. It makes me furious.

The country I live in has a shortage of medical doctors, especially psychiatrists, and that is what I want to become. However, my school is so stupid. We are a university town, the only university in the country that offers medical school, and around 20% of the graduating class goes on to study medicine. So why do we have more humanities (let me reiterate. we have a photography class. About 3 people a year EVER take it. Why does the school have a whole teacher for it?) than sciences?

Of course, humanities and arts are important. But our school doesn't even offer psychology. I see that as pretty essential to any career involving medicine. Bedside manners are important for healthcare professionals.

Anyway, the point of this rant is that kids at my school complain about how there are so few humanities options available when that is the opposite of the case. It is an embarrassment of riches. The only STEM subjects we have are calculus, statistics, physics, biology, chemistry, and digital technology. It makes me want to rip my hair out. I have no choice when the humanities/arts get painting, photography, media design, digital art, English, French, Mandarin, German, Latin, classics, history, art history, music, geography, business, agribusiness, accounting, and macroeconomics. Ugh.

edit: added more subjects to the humanities list. I hate it. so bad.","I hate the amount of arts/humanities at my school I am about to become my country's equivalent of a high school junior.

I walk into class and people complain over and over again about how our school doesn't support the arts or humanities... when we have bloody ART HISTORY as a subject and don't have a subject as basic or universal as health. Who on earth is taking art history? Every assembly, every student council meeting, every chapel service (we are a Protestant single-sex school) is about how we need support for the arts. It makes me furious.

The country I live in has a shortage of medical doctors, especially psychiatrists, and that is what I want to become. However, my school is so stupid. We are a university town, the only university in the country that offers medical school, and around 20% of the graduating class goes on to study medicine. So why do we have more humanities (let me reiterate. we have a photography class. About 3 people a year EVER take it. Why does the school have a whole teacher for it?) than sciences?

Of course, humanities and arts are important. But our school doesn't even offer psychology. I see that as pretty essential to any career involving medicine. Bedside manners are important for healthcare professionals.

Anyway, the point of this rant is that kids at my school complain about how there are so few humanities options available when that is the opposite of the case. It is an embarrassment of riches. The only STEM subjects we have are calculus, statistics, physics, biology, chemistry, and digital technology. It makes me want to rip my hair out. I have no choice when the humanities/arts get painting, photography, media design, digital art, English, French, Mandarin, German, Latin, classics, history, art history, music, geography, business, agribusiness, accounting, and macroeconomics. Ugh.

19078,1i5oh4q,post,I loved her ,"I loved her.
I loved her, the one with the light green eyes, the one with hair that has no definite color—sometimes blonde, sometimes brown—her hair is both straight and wavy at the same time.
She’s 157 cm tall, weighs 55 kg.
She has a beauty mark on her neck and another just below her lip.
There’s a dimple under the left side of her lip, and her hands are always cold.
Her body language is beautiful and elegant.

I loved her before I ever saw her face.
We spent a long time talking without meeting, hours and hours of conversations, and every day I was more amazed by her beautiful personality. Then I saw her, and to this day, she’s the most beautiful girl I’ve ever seen. She made every other girl on earth seem plain in comparison.

I loved her with a love I can’t express in words. I used to write about her, and I still do.
She has a strong yet gentle personality. She brought out a side of me that no one else had ever seen.
I connected with her wholeheartedly. She entered my imaginary world and lived in it with me. She touched my soul and made me feel that life was worth living.

She was close, understanding, and knew how to handle things. To me, she’s one of a kind.

This girl was broken from her previous relationship and because of other circumstances in her life. I wasn’t comfortable with that.
I promised her—and myself—that I’d help her forget everything and try to fix her, because I saw goodness in her.

She used to tell me how her past relationship affected her, changed her, and made her stronger. It set new standards for her—standards that wouldn’t allow her to forgive easily or repeat past mistakes.

I told her I wanted to restore her faith in relationships.
I’m a good person by nature, so it was easy for me to listen to her problems, hear her stories, focus on the details, and make her feel that someone was finally paying attention to her.
I made her my priority, and I loved her sincerely.

She was smart in relationships; she wanted us to take things step by step to make sure our relationship was healthy.
We moved forward slowly and carefully, and those were the happiest days of my life.

On October 10, I confessed my love to her, and she did too. But she was hesitant; she didn’t want a relationship.
I told her, “It’s okay, I know how you feel about me, and you know how I feel about you. It’ll be easier now.”
We continued, and the days were amazing.
Whenever there were problems, we both loved each other enough to fix them the same day.

I used to write her analyses about her personality, and it made her so happy. She said no one had ever done that for her before.
I had plans with her—big plans—and we achieved some of them, though unfortunately, not all.

She told me she had never felt this way with anyone before. She said, “It’s the first time I’ve ever been this happy.”
She said, “It’s the first time I’ve been glad to have someone in my life.”
I loved her with all my energy.
By the way, she’s my first love. I spent 20 years without any relationships because I wanted a healthy one.
We were both mature and understood each other.
We respected each other’s time and space.

We talked for hours and days without feeling bored. We discussed everything, opening up new topics every time.

She told me she felt love with me. She said she had never hugged or kissed anyone before.
And yet, even with her, I hadn’t hugged or kissed her yet.

She said she felt love with me. She said I gave her hope in life.
I made many mistakes with her, but she forgave me, and we moved forward together.

After six and a half months of talking from a distance, we decided to go on our first date and watch Ariana Grande’s new movie because she loves her.

The timing of the date couldn’t have been worse for me. I was financially struggling. I had to scrape together money from here and there just to take her out.
It was also during my final exams.
I postponed an exam scheduled for January 9 just to go out with her.

I was nervous. It was my first date, and I didn’t know what to do. But I thought, “This is the girl I love, who loves me with all her heart. She’ll understand.”

When I saw her on the date, she was stunning—beyond beautiful.
But I was awkward and uncomfortable, not knowing what to do.
She, having been on dates before because of her past relationship, was more experienced.
We had a great time; it was the best day of my life, and she was happy too.
I thought, “I’ll live the rest of my life happy with her.”

What I didn’t know was that this would be the last hug I’d get from her.

When we got home, everything seemed fine.
But the next day, January 11, she told me she’d leave me alone for a while so I could focus on studying.
I thought, “How caring of her.” I studied that day better than ever, feeling happy and fulfilled.

By the end of the day, I found it odd that she hadn’t texted me.
So I messaged her.
She said, “I have some thoughts I need to analyze and decide if they’re important or not.”

I said, “Talk to me. Vent to me.”
She said, “Are you sure? I think it’s better to wait until after your exams.”
I insisted, and then she dropped the bombshell:
“I don’t feel like you’re my type.”

I was shocked. I asked her why and reminded her of the six months we’d spent together, everything we’d shared.
I begged for another chance to show her the real me on a second date.

She said she needed time to think.
I asked her, “Why think? Don’t you love me?”
She asked me to delete her from everywhere, but I felt like what I said was wrong.
So I reached out to her again, asking for a second chance.

She told me, “I’ve decided. Honestly, I learned from my past relationship not to give second chances because everything is clear from the beginning.”

When I insisted on knowing the real reason, she shattered me completely.
She said, “My ex messaged me, and I want to give him another chance.”

I was in disbelief.
I said, “He treated you badly. Why would you even consider it?”
She replied, “I think I still love him.”

At that moment, my entire world began to collapse.
All the dreams I had with her were gone in an instant.

She said to me, “With you, I separated my feelings from my thoughts to decide if I should give you a second chance, and I decided not to.”

So I asked her, “Why don’t you separate your thoughts from your feelings regarding your ex to decide about him?”
She said, “I love him.”

She told me he had been very good to her, even though she had previously told me the opposite.
She admitted to me that she had kissed and hugged him.

I said, “Everything you told me was a lie then? Was it all just temporary feelings until he came back into your life?”
She told me, “I was selfish. I only thought about myself and didn’t think about you.”

Every moment with her, I kept discovering new shocks, each one worse than the last.

I asked her, “Why does he deserve twenty chances even though he treated you badly, while I, who treated you well, get none? What’s the difference between us?”

I started feeling inadequate, even though she had told me I was her type, her ideal crush.
Everything changed after the date for reasons that made no sense.

I kept questioning myself, “Why did I think she loved me with all her heart? Why did I fix things I shouldn’t have fixed? Why? Why? Why?”

I felt the worst emotions I’ve ever felt in my life.
I felt frozen, like all my limbs were paralyzed.
My tongue was tied.
I was afraid to blink and lose the moment.
I was afraid to move and realize it wasn’t a dream.

I felt the blood freeze in my veins.
My breath grew shallow.
Everything turned gray.
I wished it was all a nightmare I would wake up from.

I think I even heard the sound of my heart breaking.
Yes, it truly shattered—crumbled in her hands.
All my dreams with her were destroyed, disappearing forever.

We had dreamed of improving her situation, of building a project together.
Oh God, how hard it is.

My entire life felt like it had collapsed.
Before her, I felt like I wasn’t living.
She brought me back to zero.

I lost my studies, even though she had been my motivation to keep going.
And I lost her—the love of my life.

After all the pain, heartbreak, and wishing for death,
the funny thing is, I still love her.
I love her with all her details.
I love her with pure and sincere love.
I’m frustrated that I can’t hate her.

I heard the worst and harshest words from her, yet I still love her.
I feel completely broken—not just my heart, but my entire being.
And yet, I still love her.
I still love her.
I still love her.

Sometimes I blame myself for losing her, thinking it was because I had noble intentions on our date. I didn’t feel the need to touch her or kiss her so she could be comfortable, knowing it was our first time meeting in person.

Some might say maybe she didn’t like how I looked.
But, honestly, I’m much more attractive than her ex, by far.
And I treated her better than he ever did.

I used to tell her, “You don’t need anyone in life. You’re a strong girl, and you’ll succeed.”
While he told her, “You’ll never find anyone like me. I’m your only safe place, and you won’t be able to love anyone else.”

There’s a huge difference between us.
Based on the love stories I’ve read, I should have been the one she stayed with.
But it turns out love stories are lies.

Society is sick.
A broken society.
A society that cannot be fixed.

Her final words to me during our last conversation were, “I never thought you loved me this much.”

I cried for myself.
I thought I’d been deceived.
I thought she was different from all the other girls I’d seen.

No one in life deserves your love.
But she deserved every feeling I had for her.

Why do I still love her?
Why did I love her?
Why? Why? Why?

I have millions of questions in my head, and none of them have answers.","I loved her  I loved her.

19080,1i5ohfb,post,I’m 28 and my father has just been diagnosed with dementia,"He was one of those men who just was never mean to be a father. He’s in his mid-late 50s. I’m his only daughter and he has 2 sons, 7 and 14, who live with their mother who also has a brain tumour. All of them are barely surviving above the poverty line, and both parents have drug issues. 

When I was growing up, I would only spend school holidays with him and my then stepmother. He lived out of state, so I got quite used to flying on the plane on my own as a child. This made me independent. 

The only way to describe the environment when I went and stayed with them is chaotic. dad had a regular DJ gig that he played every Saturday without fail (which would usually include party drugs and bringing friends back to the house for kick-ons). He struggled to hold down any other kind of job and had extended periods of unemployment. My step mother was emotionally abusive, and treated me more like a best friend than a child. Granted, she was the one making sure I was fed and occupied by video games, but it left me with deep seated identity issues and the inability to form deep friendships for a long, long time. I saw and heard many things that I probably shouldn’t have, and there was an endless revolving door of drug addict friends who crashed on their couch. 

My father was charming, intelligent, and could be incredibly cruel. At the same time, when he shines his light on you, he makes you feel like the most important person in the world. He’s alternative, and he’s passionate, but he has an inability to follow things through. I remember him telling me he was moving to my city when I was 7, only to tell me on the day that it wasn’t happening. He loved to make promises, but couldn’t fulfil them. 

This was juxtaposed by a structured middle-upper class upbringing by my mum. I was able to get a good education, explore hobbies, and have at least one supportive and well adjusted parent, but despite this I’ve still struggled with my own drug abuse issues, a DV relationship and mental health disorders. 

It’s only now that I’m older that I’m finally starting to unravel everything, I kept a lot of it to myself as a child. But up until now, I’ve also been dealing with the fact that my half brothers are stuck in this environment and that I am not doing very much to help. I can barely help myself, and every time I talk to their mother I feel like a child again. And now my father is in need of care. And I don’t think I have the capacity to help. 

I have no assets. I have no financial way to help. I have no physical way to help unless I drop my entire life, my job, to go and care for him, when I know he isn’t going to stop drinking. I am at a complete loss of what to do and where to turn. 

I just needed to get this out into the void, I don’t have many people who can relate and I wondered if anyone out there has experienced something similar.","I’m 28 and my father has just been diagnosed with dementia He was one of those men who just was never mean to be a father.

When I was growing up, I would only spend school holidays with him and my then stepmother. He lived out of state, so I got quite used to flying on the plane on my own as a child. This made me independent. 

The only way to describe the environment when I went and stayed with them is chaotic. dad had a regular DJ gig that he played every Saturday without fail (which would usually include party drugs and bringing friends back to the house for kick-ons). He struggled to hold down any other kind of job and had extended periods of unemployment. My step mother was emotionally abusive, and treated me more like a best friend than a child. Granted, she was the one making sure I was fed and occupied by video games, but it left me with deep seated identity issues and the inability to form deep friendships for a long, long time. I saw and heard many things that I probably shouldn’t have, and there was an endless revolving door of drug addict friends who crashed on their couch. 

My father was charming, intelligent, and could be incredibly cruel. At the same time, when he shines his light on you, he makes you feel like the most important person in the world. He’s alternative, and he’s passionate, but he has an inability to follow things through. I remember him telling me he was moving to my city when I was 7, only to tell me on the day that it wasn’t happening. He loved to make promises, but couldn’t fulfil them. 

This was juxtaposed by a structured middle-upper class upbringing by my mum. I was able to get a good education, explore hobbies, and have at least one supportive and well adjusted parent, but despite this I’ve still struggled with my own drug abuse issues, a DV relationship and mental health disorders. 

It’s only now that I’m older that I’m finally starting to unravel everything, I kept a lot of it to myself as a child. But up until now, I’ve also been dealing with the fact that my half brothers are stuck in this environment and that I am not doing very much to help. I can barely help myself, and every time I talk to their mother I feel like a child again. And now my father is in need of care. And I don’t think I have the capacity to help. 

I have no assets. I have no financial way to help. I have no physical way to help unless I drop my entire life, my job, to go and care for him, when I know he isn’t going to stop drinking. I am at a complete loss of what to do and where to turn. 

I just needed to get this out into the void, I don’t have many people who can relate and I wondered if anyone out there has experienced something similar.",1,0,2025-01-20 11:51,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1i5ohfb/im_28_and_my_father_has_just_been_diagnosed_with/,Neutral

19086,m85cwiw,comment,,"humanities/arts classes, at least in my country, often have a wider variety of options to select, because many people taking these only take them because they need one/multiple of them to pass class, without directly being interested in it for a future. Doing art is fun, debating philosophy is fun; they're all pretty chill classes where you can learn a thing or two about yourself and depending on the class also the world; but it's generally speaking more broad subjects and appear way more chill, which is an easier pick if you are already stressed from school otherwise.

While if you go for a STEM class focused on medicine...yea, ur not gonna do that unless you are extremely interested in medicine already. If it is like you say and a shit ton of people passing that school wanna study medicine, it would certainly make sense to have a class into that direction, definitely.  
But generally speaking, a lot of people just hate and/or struggle with math, and 80% of the stem classes are immediately a pass for them due to that lmao. So you will see a smaller variety there.

Also, teachers.  
They gotta exist, last thing I remember is that medicine sectors are already extremely understaffed, so finding someone who studied both medicine and whatever you need t become a teacher on top will be a challenge, when the pay as an actual doctor is probably 3 to 8 times that of a teacher; or they could instead work at a University as a professor and also make way more money than a teacher while having access to the cool university labroratories.

In general, you'll find a lot of people who could become teachers can simply go somewhere else and make more money and be more respected, especially those studies that fuck around a lot with math, chemistry and or biology.  
At least over here where I live, we also have an extreme shortage on teachers for math and physics, we don't even have chemistry taught in all schools anymore because we just lack the teachers lmao.

19103,1i5p7ow,post,Things weren't supposed to be this way ,"TL;DR : My GFs mother is a real problem that's hard to get away from.

My father never wanted me but because my mother supported his single guy lifestyle and my grandmother kept hounding him I was able to grow up with him around for the first 11 years of my life. Fast forward to now where I have my own son whom I am fully committed to but unable to have around/be around often because of the situation between me and my girlfriends mother. It's like I'm getting the experience my dad wanted and he got the experience that I want. 

She has stated multiple times that I'm not needed and that she has no problem breaking up the relationship between me and my GF. She has stated that her and her family need space so even though I'm just at there house to see my girlfriend and my son it can't be over everyday and night. Even though her mom is a threat my GF is also a big part of this problem because she's consistently picking the comfort of staying in her own home over coming over to my place even occasionally. 

There's been quite a few big decisions that have been made regarding our son between my GF and her mother that I have come to find out after instead of being involved in and the only thing that I have gotten is I love you and an apology. 

I want us to move to move away to somewhere so that we can grow as a family of 3 without the toxic hindrances from my GFs mother but at this time the risk of her running back to her parents house when things get tough is high. The last thing I want to do is be stuck paying an apartment alone because she ran off back to her parents house and have to deal with the courts to get split custody but the fact that things have barely changed since our son has been born is really getting to me. I'm starting to think about putting a 1 year timer on this situation before I bring things into court.","Things weren't supposed to be this way  TL;DR : My GFs mother is a real problem that's hard to get away from.

19104,1i5p9eq,post,I really don’t like my bfs roommate.,"It’s a lot to get into but basically me and my bf of a bit over a year were keeping us being together on the down low because his brother used to have a thing for me like five years ago back in high school. Anyways his roommate is in the same friend group as my bf and all their friends including his brother. His roommate told his brother about us even though he knew we weren’t ready to talk to him about this yet this past week. His brother has since blocked us both and has had zero contact. I get along with his roommates girlfriend just fine she’s fun and we hang out when the boys are gone or at work. She has even suggested me moving in with them, my boyfriend would also like me to move in, everyone seemed cool until his roommate/friend told his brother, since then it’s been messy. His roommate used to say he was cool with me moving in as long as I pay rent (duh) but now he’s saying that there’s too much drama around me now in their friend group. He also didn’t have a problem with me staying in my bfs room all day while he was at work mostly cause I just slept and didn’t leave the room at all, not even to really use the bathroom or get food I’d just sleep cause he works long hours, but again that has changed since he started saying I have a lot of drama around me, he’s also started saying he doesn’t feel comfortable with me being there when bf isn’t. Which is fine cause if you aren’t comfortable you aren’t comfortable i understand, it’s just that I’ve been doing this for probably about 5-6 months now and it’s only a problem now? Idk I really am not a fan of his roommate but it is what it is. I’ll still try to be nice and be respectful, it just bugs me cause he says he doesn’t have anything against me then does all this kinda proving he does have something against me not only that but he also violated my bfs trust in him to prove he has something against me. I just feel sad because mine and bfs schedule don’t tend to line up so we don’t have the same days off but on my days off I’d go over and spend the night and make sure bf is up for work on time, I’ve done his laundry, and make sure he gets good food every day if I used their kitchen I would get permission from one of them first, when he’s been sick I’ve been right there to help him even if it means I get sick too, before this job he had a bit of a rough patch but I helped him with bills and made sure he was alright financially, I really really care about my bf, but it makes me sad since I won’t be able to see him as much now. Idk what quite to do here I don’t want to disrespect my bfs relationship with his friend but I feel like his friend has been disrespecting my relationship with my bf.","I really don’t like my bfs roommate.

He hid the fact that he had an affair and an affair child for almost 10 years from us.

It’s been 2 months since my mom found out the truth, and he moved out to start the pre-divorce process. Since my younger brother left for college, it’s just me and my mom living together.

I know this is the hardest time of her life. I get that. They were their first love and they had been together almost 30 years.

The things is she cries so much in front of me and keeps venting about how horrible my dad is at least every other day. Nothing new has happened, but she keeps repeating the same things she’s already said 30 times.

I’m so sick of it. I don’t want to hear a single thing about their drama anymore. It’s their life, not mine.

I know she’s never felt this betrayed, and I really do feel bad for her. Also I freaking hate my dad. I  know I’m the only person she can talk to because it’s too messed up to share with anyone else. But still, I’m at my limit.

These days, I just sit there, pretending to listen. I don’t say a word—I just nod without any real reaction, hoping she’ll stop. But it never ends. 

What she’s doing is dragging me down with her. It’s making me depressed, and I have no idea what to do anymore.

The worst thing is I feel like I'm a terrible person feeling this way, maybe I really am tho.

Ugh

Everything was so perfect till this morning. I was sleeping in arms of love of my life(30M) in a hotel suite , we are on surprised international trip he planned for us. His phone rang waking both of us , it was unknown no., he hastily stepped aside, picked it and argued briefly with whoever was on other side of phone then turned to me. I was still half asleep. Confused, I asked him what happened. I thought it was something about his family, he handles his family business and his relationship with his father is very tense. He didn't try to give a excuse just sat down on bed saying we need to talk. Now I was scared .

He said , he has a wife.. A goddamn WIFE and my jaw dropped i didn't know how to react. He panicked, trying to hold me , apologizing asking a chance to explain.
It was an arranged marriage , he wasn't against it but he never loved her. There families are close , they got married within 2 months on meeting, he doesn't have any kids.He met me after two years of their marriage, he wasn't unhappy but he couldn't stop himself from seeing me.
He is planning to divorce her , I went through his phone it's True. He asked for divorce, she is against it , he didn't told her reason but said sorry and that he never loved her , there was also mention of their marriage being arranged. He said he was still with her just to please their families, he also showed me the ring , he was planning to propose me and tell me everything after divorce. He said he wants to marry me , I just slapped him hard and told him to get out. He broke down but stepped outside to give me space. 

I have been crying since.Never in million years i imagined this , he never gave me a reason. We spent so much time together, he never made excuses. 
 I feel betrayed ,hurt, so guilty for still wanting him.I feel so angry at him.
I want to forgive him so bad , he is everything I ever wanted, I love him , I love him so much. He has helped me through a lot, gave me courage to stand up to my physically, mentally abusive family, he made feel so loved. I use to post about all the sweet things he does for me, he is gentleman through and through... we had our arguments but I never raised his voice. I did , he just waited till I calm down. 
He is my first everything, my first kiss, my first love , I can't imagine my life without him...

I have cried so much so my chest and throat hurts physically, I don't know what to do..I really don't know what to do..","Just found out I(23f) am the other woman , after 4 years  I am the other woman guys , the home wrecker. I am currently sitting on bed crying my heart out.

He said , he has a wife.. A goddamn WIFE and my jaw dropped i didn't know how to react. He panicked, trying to hold me , apologizing asking a chance to explain.
It was an arranged marriage , he wasn't against it but he never loved her. There families are close , they got married within 2 months on meeting, he doesn't have any kids.He met me after two years of their marriage, he wasn't unhappy but he couldn't stop himself from seeing me.
He is planning to divorce her , I went through his phone it's True. He asked for divorce, she is against it , he didn't told her reason but said sorry and that he never loved her , there was also mention of their marriage being arranged. He said he was still with her just to please their families, he also showed me the ring , he was planning to propose me and tell me everything after divorce. He said he wants to marry me , I just slapped him hard and told him to get out. He broke down but stepped outside to give me space. 

I have been crying since.Never in million years i imagined this , he never gave me a reason. We spent so much time together, he never made excuses. 
 I feel betrayed ,hurt, so guilty for still wanting him.I feel so angry at him.
I want to forgive him so bad , he is everything I ever wanted, I love him , I love him so much. He has helped me through a lot, gave me courage to stand up to my physically, mentally abusive family, he made feel so loved. I use to post about all the sweet things he does for me, he is gentleman through and through... we had our arguments but I never raised his voice. I did , he just waited till I calm down. 
He is my first everything, my first kiss, my first love , I can't imagine my life without him...

I have cried so much so my chest and throat hurts physically, I don't know what to do..I really don't know what to do..",16,6,2025-01-20 13:11,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1i5ptkn/just_found_out_i23f_am_the_other_woman_after_4/,Neutral

Lastly, again, I am sorry for this entire thing. You didn’t deserve this and this man used you for his own benefit. Please stay strong and stand your ground. Don’t forgive him and find the will to move on with your life. You are still very young and have time to move on and find someone new who didn’t lie to your face the first day that you met",1,,2025-01-20 13:58,t3_1i5ptkn,,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1i5ptkn/just_found_out_i23f_am_the_other_woman_after_4/m85s0tc/,Neutral

19141,1i5us06,post,I’m struggling so hard with this break up ,"My partner and I broke up last weekend. We had reoccurring issues in our relationship that I just couldn’t take anymore. Constantly cheating, lying, negative comments about me and my body, etc. Normally with these kind of problems I’d say good riddance, but I can’t shake the doubt this time. Things weren’t always bad, he used to be perfect. 

There was this whole big deal about 8 months ago when it came out that his mother’s fiance is a registered sex offender. Child offenses. I’m a mother, and I regularly brought my young daughter and niece around this person. Due to their relationship with my (now ex) partner and his mother, this person was even trusted on a few occasions with the children. I had no idea. My partner had no idea. His mom and his mom’s best friend knew, and they hid it from us. They met him after he got out of prison, and he has them convinced he “took the fall” for his (conveniently dead) brother. 

There were some unrelated circumstances that brought the issue to light, and I was immediately terrified and furious. Thankfully, after some careful conversations, both children were pretty clear that nothing happened, but that didn’t change the fact that they hid something that important from me and let me put those kids at risk by trusting him. I felt like my kids were a sick experiment for them. 

It also came out that this person was working illegally and violating their probation. Someone reported them, and of course his family immediately pointed their fingers at me. There’s plenty of others who knew that information and disliked this person, but I understood that it was easier to point to finger at someone who voiced their anger and concerns. 

I distanced myself from his family, his mother’s Fiance got arrested, and then that’s when everything spiraled. It was like my partner just suddenly changed. He was meaner. He started using fetlife to try to meet up with other women, he started hiding extra social media accounts that he would use to find and exchange videos/pictures (sometimes of me) with other women. It was a mess. In December, I finally hit a breaking point and told him I couldn’t do it anymore. I told him that this was the last time, and that I needed him to grow up and be the man I believed he was. 

He swore things would change. 

We got through Christmas with his family, it was nice. After the New Year, he told me that his mom’s fiance would be getting out of jail, no new charges. I told him I didn’t want to be around that person, and I wouldn’t attend any family events they were at. It’s worth noting that the rest of his family has no idea—they told them he got arrested for a DUI. 

And then he started using his extra snap account again that he had promised was deleted. I confronted him, and he immediately jumped to wanting to break up with me. So, I agreed. 

During the breakup, he said that we have no future anyway because I wouldn’t compromise and agree to be around a predator. That I wouldn’t let my daughter or our future kids stay the night with them, or go on family vacations if the fiance was present. That he’d only be willing to fix things if I agreed to that. That his mom’s fiance has “done a lot” for him, and that he “served his time and deserves another chance.” 

I know that I’m clinging to a version of my partner that frankly just doesn’t exist anymore, but I just don’t understand why he can’t see the insanity in asking that of me. I can’t grasp why he’s so adamant about maintaining that relationship, or why he doesn’t feel the same level of disgust that I do. Before all of this, our relationship was phenomenal, and our future was clear. Now, because I won’t compromise on this, he says there’s no future where we’re together. And that the last few years were just a waste of time. 

I’m never going to get closure here, and I know that. But I’m struggling so hard to accept this. I love him to pieces and I just can’t let that go. He seems set in wanting move on, but now I’m second guessing myself. Was I unreasonable? ","I’m struggling so hard with this break up  My partner and I broke up last weekend.

19142,1i5vobr,post,This pathological liar is ruining my life... ,"**If anyone has any recommendations about how to handle this situation I would be more than grateful**

This story is almost too crazy to write down and I barely believe that it's actually happening to me in real life. 

To start all of it off- my boyfriend broke up with me a week before Christmas. I had about five days to pack all of my things in the house and then I booked a flight home to be with my family. 

The day that I left the house- my roommate brought a girl home from Bumble. 

This 22 year old has been causing me absolutely the most horrible pain I have ever had to endure- and no one else is standing up for me or stopping her from ruining my life. 

To begin-

This girl- Angelina Tawfeek tells some of the most insidious stories that could really really damage people's lives. She is saying that people have sexually assaulted her, tried to kill her, poisoned her, molested her, laced her weed with meth, laced her brownies with poisons, accused people of being pedophiles, accused her landlord of stealing her belongings, told people that he car was bugged. The list is endless. 

In Massachusetts- she had one of her ex boyfriends sent to prison. (Most people that know the situation know that she made false accusations). Once he was in prison, she moved to Hawaii to begin stalking a family friend of her ex (that she sent to prison). This person currently has a restraining order against her. 

She then began dating someone for a year and a half. This person also has a permanent restraining order against her now (I was sent screenshots of a message between this boyfriend and someone else describing the nature of their relationship- her being very abusive towards him. He has pressed charges of domestic violence) He also shared that she has BPD, NPD, and hallucinations.

Then she met my roommate. Who- dealing with his own trauma, is defending this girl with his life and believing all of her stories. 

So he brings her home and gets my ex boyfriend involved. And being the kind of person my ex is- goes to help this person immediately get out of her ""bad"" situation. Offering to rent a room in the house, etc. 

During this time- I was letting them use my car while I was out of town. Angelina STOLE my Tesla and drove it wrecklessly until it was out of charge on the side of the highway. This caused her to no longer be welcome to rent a room. And my ex forbit Angelina from being inside my vehicle.

She goes to another house and rents a room and continues to do all sorts of really dangerous and damaging behavior. And she got arrested and evicted. At this point too- her car was towed and impounded. (I've had conversations with the landlord there). 

She goes back to my roommate and the house and asks again to rent and she needs help getting a new vehicle because ""hers was bugged by her ex boyfriend who was stalking her"". Even though the car had been impounded by the police. So my ex boyfriend helps get her a new leased vehicle. 

She then moves in to the house and within one say- destroyed hundreds of dollars of belongings because ""the police were coming for her and treating her like a terrorist - Cody left me home alone so I had to destroy all of his stuff. I'm not sorry, I would do it all again."" is literally what she said to me on the phone. 

That night she was told she needed to leave the house. She did not leave and my ex boyfriend called the cops and had her arrested. My ex now currently also has a restraining order against her. 

The next day- Cody bails her out of jail and Angelina immediately texts my ex boyfriends new girlfriend (that's a whole other story)- that Angelina fucked my ex boyfriend. So now the new girlfriend texts me (at 3 am) to get the scoop. Now Angelina - being spiteful that my boyfriend got her arrested, is claiming that he took advantage of her while she was not in a sober state. 

Cody has acknowledged that Angelina is a pathological liar- and he still chooses to bring her close to the rest of us and put her at risk. He continues to allow her inside my vehicle - I was very close to having them both arrested for vehicle theft. 

Last night I was up at 4 am dealing with the police and Cody trying to get this girl out of my car- she's been sleeping in my Tesla because she doesn't have another place to live. 

All this to say- this person is very dangerous. And I can't seem to get anyone else to make her go away. I'm terrified she is going to hurt my dog.

19144,1i63wpc,post,Somebody please help me ,"I'm crying uncontrollably and haven't stopped for why's going on 2 hours. I took an edible thinking I was going to laugh and take my mind off things that have happened to me this year but now I can't stop crying and it makes me sadder that I'm crying...so if this is suppose to make me feel better, I feel like shit. I just want to stop suffering why can't I get away from it? 

I had so much shit happen to me this year and the years post covid. I for the last four days keep taking edibles just to take the edge off and escape my current reality 

But I'm on the verge of filing bankruptcy, the stress from life is affect the side of my hair which falling out and creating a bald spot.

I had to walk away from an engagement to my partner of five years due to his behavior towards me, his porn addiction and his gambling with the stock market habits and borderline physical abuse. I'm hurting how bad I miss the family we had despite all this. I can't believe that the person who loved me hurt me and blamed me. We had three dogs, two of whom passed one year after the next from old age. Now it's just me and the last baby. He's 3 now and I can't imagine life without him. In like what? 8 to 9 years? 

My grandmother has both dementia and cancer and her behavior is so ugly and hurtful to my mother that mom has checked out emotionally and mentally. 

I have to think about the physical child abuse I went through with my mother. Or of course I have to think about the time I was 
Sexually abusing my younger brother and sister when I 7 or 8 and not realizing what I was doing was bad until I started to think about why I would sneak to do this when mom wasn't around. 

I have to think about when I got caught why did no one stand up for me. Why am I the bad guy if it happened to
Me first. I had no idea what I was doing at 7 or 8 years old.  It happened to me by my fucking female cousin who was the in foster care system probably getting raped or molested by someone. Why when I bring it up everyone tells me to let it go and that the past is the past. Or how im pretty fucking sure my step father ran his hands through my breast in my sleep when I was 18 but I couldn't be sure if it until one day I opened my eyes and he was getting ready for working looking over me in my sleep.

 It's not a big deal when I speak on it. 
And the irony of all is that is that I work for a behavioral tech practice that is so unbelievably corrupt where money is what's important, clinicians Treat their staff like second class citizen but patient needs come dead to last. I have to remember that 
I lost not one but two babies one through miscarriage and the other though abortion. 

Since I moved to Texas I have lost my entire identity. I've gained 45 pounds  and. I really miss who I was back home in NY. I eat my stress, and I eat my feelings and right now I'm rocking back and forth on a rocking chair unsure if I should go to the gym and lose weight while calming my nerves from this sudden burst of tears feel like a psychotic break. 

The last 4 months I was having multiple dates with men and had unprotected sex that luckily did not result in any stds . I never thought I could be this reckless. I didn't think I could be that person. Why did I choose to do that? Why did I choose to be reckless? And at point did I push men away? 

I just wanted the regular marriage and family. Have I not gone through enough?! Why is there more pain?  

I have been thinking of a contingency plan to end my life on my terms but I want to give this dog the happiest life he can have with me. I don't see things getting better in my personal or work and just life in general, sucks. I don't like the way we treat animals or each other. I don't want to be around so much disappointment or continue to deal with the diappointment I have of
Myself or the ones some of you have of me. I'm tired of existing and living bland. 

I can stick around a little longer for the dog longer but I can't be here past my 50s. Already at 34 this is unbearable. 

I've been becoming misanthropic towards people and of course put a facade at work. But recently some folks have been testing my patience, Some clinicians are really rude and nasty and it's making my job harder to manage my facade. 

 I can focus on something other than myself for hours but when I have time in between, I get upset sad and lonely and can't get through the day without feeling so much emptiness and sadness from all the tragedy and sabotage. 

Why does he blame me for the breakup and blame me instead holding himself accountable? He humiliated me enough 

I wish someone could see the value in me or like me for who I am. I'm losing my hair for trying so hard to fit right in but people are so sucky I stick back out again. 

I'm tired
Of pretending. 
I wish I could tell them ALL I'm dealing with ptsd.

The last 4 months I was having multiple dates with men and had unprotected sex that luckily did not result in any stds . I never thought I could be this reckless. I didn't think I could be that person. Why did I choose to do that? Why did I choose to be reckless? And at point did I push men away? 

I just wanted the regular marriage and family. Have I not gone through enough?! Why is there more pain?  

I have been thinking of a contingency plan to end my life on my terms but I want to give this dog the happiest life he can have with me. I don't see things getting better in my personal or work and just life in general, sucks. I don't like the way we treat animals or each other. I don't want to be around so much disappointment or continue to deal with the diappointment I have of
Myself or the ones some of you have of me. I'm tired of existing and living bland. 

I can stick around a little longer for the dog longer but I can't be here past my 50s. Already at 34 this is unbearable. 

I've been becoming misanthropic towards people and of course put a facade at work. But recently some folks have been testing my patience, Some clinicians are really rude and nasty and it's making my job harder to manage my facade. 

 I can focus on something other than myself for hours but when I have time in between, I get upset sad and lonely and can't get through the day without feeling so much emptiness and sadness from all the tragedy and sabotage. 

Why does he blame me for the breakup and blame me instead holding himself accountable? He humiliated me enough 

I wish someone could see the value in me or like me for who I am. I'm losing my hair for trying so hard to fit right in but people are so sucky I stick back out again. 

I'm tired
Of pretending. 
I wish I could tell them ALL I'm dealing with ptsd.

19145,1i66arx,post,The worst people I know are celebrating trumps win lmao,"The worst people I know in my small town are celebrating Trumps win. There’s:

1. The woman who’s celebrating with her husband who is being investigated because he was having an affair with a local elementary school teacher, got her addicted to meth, gave her so much that she OD’d, pushed her body out of his car at the emergency room and drove off, and she ended up dying, leaving behind an orphaned 8 year old son.


2. The mid 20 year old girl who got a DUI because she got shitfaced and couldn’t find her car, so she called the cops and reported it stolen, eventually found it and drove away, only to get pulled over for driving a vehicle that was reported stolen. She got handcuffed and flashed her breasts to about a hundred onlookers.


3. The local former cop who had a reputation for preying on middle school and high school girls. He would pull over freshly 16 year olds to the point that their parents had to tell them not to drive alone at night. Oh and his wife and her dad got convicted for embezzlement previously.

I hate this country haha

Edit: if three isn’t a big enough sample size:

4. The boss I had who would reminisce to me about the times he went to visit factories he leased in China and how he would throw US dollars at workers and watch them fight over them.

5. The hotel tycoon who owns 80% of the town, exploits his workers, and regularly scams and cons  guests out of their money, keeps the town impoverished, and was so bad that he got investigated by the states AG.

6.  Gay former meth addict who has been arrested twice for buying meth and convicted once for sexually assaulting a woman.

19146,1i671im,post,My sister is having another baby with the man who assaulted me.,"I just need to get this off my chest because I feel like I’m drowning right now. I found out today that my sister is pregnant with her 4th child. Normally, this would be happy news, but her husband—the father of her kids—is the man who sexually assaulted me when I was a teenager.

When I finally got the courage to tell her what happened, she didn’t believe me. She chose him over me. She blocked me, cut me out of her life, and has refused to speak to me since.

Now, she’s having another baby with him, and it feels like a fresh wound all over again. It’s heartbreaking. I loved my sister so much, and I still do, but I can’t understand how she can look at him every day knowing what he did to me. It makes me sick to think of him raising children, being around them, and acting like he’s some kind of good father when I know what he’s capable of.

I don’t know how to cope with this. The grief, the anger, the heartbreak—it’s overwhelming. I feel so betrayed by someone I thought would protect me. And now, knowing they’re building a life together, I just feel so… lost. Literally a month before I told her, I remember standing out on the balcony of a beach resort with her on a family vacation. She was telling me how she would do anything for me, to keep me safe, even putting me before her own husband if it came to it. That statement unfortunately didn't age well and made it sting that much more when she went against her word. 

I’m scared for her kids, and I’m scared for myself because I don’t know how to carry all this pain. I just needed to let it out somewhere because it’s too much to handle on my own. What hurts even more is that I helped raise her oldest son, my nephew, when her husband at the time cheated and left her the day after she got back from the hospital. Which makes it even harder for me to understand why she would ever doubt me. 




Edit: 

I just want to say thank you again for all of the kind responses I've received, as they have truly lightened my spirit. Last night I took a long hot epsom bath to gather my thoughts and I really started to see the big picture. Even with the pain that I feel deep in the crevices of my heart and soul, I can only imagine living in a world of illusion like my sister is. She's an incredible mother, and I hope that one day she will choose her and her children over the fairytale life she thought she was going to have with this man. I ultimately want the best for her and my nephews. With that, I also want the best for myself. I'm going to be opening up about this in therapy this week after holding back for so long to try and avoid the pain. Trauma therapy is crucial at this time and I just need to rip the bandaid off... which I feel I did in a way with this post. Thank you all.

Women blaming men for all the world’s problems. Calling all men rapists and abusers when anyone with an ounce of common sense knows that isn’t true.

The rhetoric around men’s rights has become toxic. Defending guys who are obviously abusive or rapists. When did guys stop wanting to be protective.

When did we all stop just being people? Defined by our individuality and not our gender. When did we stop admiring the opposite sex for how great they are. Can’t we separate the world into shitty people and not shitty people rather than men vs women. It’s all become an obstacle in the path to actually trying to fix many of these issues. You aren’t going to win guys away from the toxic masculinity culture by prejudging them and you aren’t going to pull women out of their misandry by treating them like pieces of meat.

It took me nearly a year of intensive therapy to move past what men have done to me in the past and I refuse to undo all of that work by entertaining the media saying men are trash. However, I'd still like to add my two cents.

Most of what I hear about is men disparaging women, treating them like livestock, etc. Whereas most of the women voices I hear of are generalizing that men are the problem because... They are to a woman.

Men kill women. Men perpetrate the majority of shootings. Men are more often violent. (Obviously not ALL men, but it's scary out there!) Of course, women are capable of being shitty and insane and killing and raping too but when your own complaint in this post is ""Men don't see women as people and women are mad about it"" it speaks for itself.

Women are getting loud and pissed off. How do they know who to trust when marriage is often the flipping switch in a guy's personality? Easier to assume everyone is bad to stay safe.

Men are getting loud and pissed off for being judged as a whole and their response is to... Double down treating women as objects?

There are many more nuanced aspects in history and current politics and rage selling whatever someone is pedaling, but I'm simply not educated enough to speak on those aspects of the discussion."," I don't come across much of the content that you are talking about and that is by design.

19153,1i6e0vy,post,I did it!,"Warning: Very very long!

Trigger warning (DV/SA/mention of SH)

Hi everyone,

My daughter recently turned 17 and it just hit me that it will only be one more year that we are legally tied to her father. I've been counting down the time since she was 3 and I would like to share our story. I will be very honest and won't try to sugarcoat my own stupid decisions along the way. It is a very long story and there is still so much more that wouldn't fit in here, but I don't know how I could make it any shorter. Please feel free to ask me anything. Maybe it can help some of you or give you a little bit of hope. Or just keep you from making the same mistakes. Or maybe I'm just yelling it out into the void. Here we go.

1997

I met my ex when I was 15, he was 21. He approached me and was very blunt about being intererested in me. I was an angsty teen, lonely, insecure and arrogant and he was challenging and charismatic and his interest in me made me feel good. Nobody was ever really interested in me before. We dated for a while, until his fiancé (that I didn't know of) called me on my 16th birthday out of the blue. 

I had gone out with him and his friends many times and found out they covered for him and one of them must have finally told her. The next day he convinced her that nothing romantic ever happened and I was basically stalking him (while me and my parents were on the phone with them), even though even my parents confirmed to her that he introduced himself as my boyfriend and was in our house many times. She believed him. I couldn't wrap my head around how someone could lie to my face like that, it felt so bizarre. I moved on.

2000/2001

I then met him again 3 years later, he pretended to want a friendship for a while, then tried to get back together with me, got mad when I refused because I had a boyfriend and left my life again for some years.

2006/2007

5 1/2 years later we met again online. We started writing every day and met in person after a month and the sparks were back. The bad memories felt so long ago, we were different people now. We started dating again, it felt like the greatest lovestory ever. He proposed fast and talked about how I was meant to be the mother of his children. I got pregnant within 5 months. He was happy first until realisation hit him, I guess - and he confessed that he was married and couldn't leave his wife for financial reasons. After lots of fights and tears I conceded and decided to play along for the sake of my child, who I already loved so much. She was born in early 2008.

2008/2009

We lived in 2 separate cities and for about two years he visited me every other weekend-ish. He kept telling me that his marriage and his wife were his business to handle and if I would interfere I would destroy everything. So I kept playing along and stayed out of it. He wasn't there when our daughter was born and he left me alone with our newborn child when I came home from the hospital with a flu and a 40°C fever.

He didn't pay child support, he wasn't available when I needed him (because I couldn't call him) and he got angry when I was desperate and burnt out and eventually broke down from the stress of being a single mother to a child with semi-chronic illnesses (she fortunately grew out of it), with no other real family anymore except for my low-contact sister who lives 4 hours away, no support system and no money, so I had to balance work and being there for my sick kid and everything else. I lived in an appartment he owned (bought with his wifes signature on the loan) and he made me pay rent. I basically made minus 500 bucks every month and couldn't even apply for government support because I would have had to name him and he gaslit me into thinking that that would destroy everything financially at that time if his wife found out. He told me to stop complaining about being overwhelmed because others do it too (I also realized years later I most likely had PPD). 

He expected me to be available for sex whenever he came over and didn't really care about my consent (yeah, it only clicked years later what that actually was..). I grew resentful. He became jealous of the new and only (female) friend I had (I'm not even bi), because we spent a lot of time together, helping each other with our kids.

2010

When our kid was 2 years old, I finally had enough and broke up with him. So then he decided the time was right to finally tell his wife. He came to me, told me he told everyone (including his parents who were incredibly mad at him for keeping their first grandchild a secret for two years) and expected me to jump right into playing happy family, like flipping a switch.

I tried for a while, thinking that that was all I ever wanted and he wasn't lying after all when he always promised we would be together one day. I finally won, right?

As much as I wanted to be happy, but realizing little things started grating on me. Like how now I could just easily take a shower if I needed to when he was there made me realize what he robbed me off. It started to get to me how much easier it could have been. But I decided to give it a try, now that I finally had him. 

He understood that I didn't want to move into a house with him and his parents right away, so he decided we should buy a house somewhere else. He found one he liked, a 1 1/2 h drive away from my job, in the middle of nowhere. I told him I would love to find the perfect place for both of us, but this was not it for me. 

He went absolutely crazy. He started spamming all my email-adresses, calling me the c-,b- and w-word and a liar and many other things. I was at work at the time and completely shocked by the sudden hate. To this day I don't know why this triggered him so hard.

Soon after I found out I was pregnant again. I went no contact after his attacks, but felt obligated to tell him and his tone shifted immediately. I told him I wasn't excited about having another child with him and he told me he would support any decision I would make. After some hard internal back and forth I decided to have an abortion. When I told him after it was done, he immediately switched back to being aggressive, only this time with more direct threats (very graphic violent ideations of what he would do to me, promising to destroy every part of my life), as well as contacting colleagues of mine he had never met and remembered the names of, to tell them in detail what a horrible person I am and that I unalived his baby. And he broke into my place, just to show me that he could. And then he evicted me from his appartment that I paid rent for.

So I took him to court for harrassment. That put me in more debt, but I got a restraining order and supervised visits at a neutral agency out of it and started to heal a little bit after all this chaos. No direct contact.

Until my sister's wedding a few months later. My kid was a flowergirl and one of the photos was so precious, so cute that I couldn't help but wanting to share this special moment with him. So I sent it to him and we started talking again. He apologized like nobody every apologized to me before. He wrote me a letter where it seemed like he read my mind and really understood deeply all the things he had done wrong. He was so sure I was the one. We decided to try one last time. Take it slow this time. I moved in with him 3 months later, into his house, with his parents. I told myself I wanted to give it one last shot, so I would at the very least never feel like I didn't try hard enough to give my kid a complete family.

As soon as I moved in, he lost all interest in me. He expected me to keep the house clean, cook, take care of our daughter and work, of course. I was the only breadwinner at the time. He was convinced providing the house we live in (that he inherited from his grandmother) was enough and spent his time gaming, doing some shady side business with people I didn't know or doing god knows what. 

During this time we/he used up my entire small inheritance (I got 10k right around the time he evicted me) on his debts and his unemployment. When the money was gone, he wanted me to ask my sister for money and I drew a very hard line. We fought a lot at that time. I worked nightshifts every weekend and stayed with a friend in the city from Friday to Monday, we lived about an hour away and I didn't like driving at night so much. When we got into a fight one evening I told him I wanted to leave. I was in the bedroom, packing. My kid with me. He started shouting, calling me names, mocking me. When I wanted to leave he blocked the door. When I tried to push through, he shoved me hard against the doorframe and I fell and hit my head. I'll never forget my kid screaming and crying in fear. She also still remembers (she was 3). He didn't let me go. He broke me a little bit more that night. I knew I needed to get out, but I didn't know how.

2011

One day when I came back home from work, I found long, coloured hair in our shower and in the bed that definitely wasn't mine. He presented some bs theory to brush it off and I knew something was up, but I knew I needed proof. When I confronted him he tried to gaslight me, called me crazy, saying that I was trying to break our family apart. I started investigating. Luckily (yes, really) one day he got into a little accident with my car and the inconsistencies of how it happened gave me some clues and I ended up finding his AP. I packed my kid and our most important stuff and left the same day while he was out.

When he found out he completely lost it. In a call he jumped back and forth from begging and offering to give me his house if I'd come back to promising to destroy me for taking his child away from him, often mid-sentence, sometimes laughing and shouting and crying at the same time. When I had to return for important documents and made his mother promise he wouldn't be there, he was waiting for me in the driveway with a knife in his hand. I was terrified and refused to enter the house.

I left and got a spot at a women's shelter. Words can not describe how guilty and relieved I felt when the social worker there assured me I could block him everywhere, we would proceed via official channels only and he could not take our child away from me because of that. And they helped me get my daughter into therapy to help her through this trauma. He tried to dictate his conditions to every single person he interacted with and the case worker said she never met anyone so assertive and aggressive and manipulative in her whole carreer, and she was dealing with DV-cases for over 30 years.

2012

After months of fights through third parties and court dates we started coparenting. He still wasn't paying any child support even though he did work at the time. He once told me on the phone that if I'd ever go after him officially for child support, he'd just keep on quitting his job (in our country my application would then be suspended). And when I tried he actually did. He said he didn't want me to have his money after I ruined him and that's obviously all I ever cared about.

So I started insisting on written communication only. He tried to scare/force me into verbal agreements for a while and attacked me constantly in an attempt to gain control back (and I had panic attacks every time I got a message from him), but I stood firm. No more unrecorded 1on1 conversations he could twist afterwards. 

I found an appartment in the city, found a daycare for my kid and found the grey rock method. My mental health was at rock bottom. I was happy to be out, but still scared and had panic attacks. I started having outbursts of uncontrollable anger and got scared of myself. And then I finally started therapy for myself. 

2013

It all calmed down slowly, but gradually and we both started seeing new people. The day he told me he had a new girlfriend (of course he tried to rub it in, thinking I would really still care) was one of my happiest at that time. I was releaved that he would finally focus on someone else and thankfully, that's exactly what happened. I did feel bad for his new victim, but I just didn have it in me to warn her. I had to make sure we were safe from him. 

2012-2019

Years went by and he had a new girlfriend every other year. They were all really nice, but never lasted long (he cheated on all of them) and those relationships were filled with drama. On our end we received the random, occasional outbursts when things went to shit in his life, over and over, but he knew I would fight back harder now and so it was all bark, no bite. Exhausting, but managable. 

We developed a routine for our daughter. He had her every other weekend and half of the holidays, but of course there were a lot of last-minute changes from his side, which I usually would agree to, because I had the capacity and I didn't care to be right, I just wanted as little as possible to do with him. Sometimes I felt like a coward, but I just decided to focus on having a good life with my kid with as little stress as possible.

At this point I have to say that the doorframe-incident was the only time our daughter ever saw him like that. Despite his many flaws he did try his best to be a good father for her. Believe me, it is not easy for me to admit that. He read books to her, he taught her how to ride a bike, he took her on daytrips and went to parent-teacher-conferences. He was sometimes a bit strict, but nothing out of the ordinary. And she had him wrapped around her finger. He adored her. I tell you this because I want you to understand why I tried my best to enable an unbiased relationship between the two. Sometimes she was annoyed by him, but overall she knew he loved her and cared about her. I kept his bad behaviour towards me away from her as much as possible. I saw what being abandoned by his dad did to my best friend's son and I was happy for my kid that she could grow up feeling loved by both parents. We found stability.

2019

My daughter started to make excuses and didn't want to visit him anymore. And then she confided in me. Some weeks back, she had caught him cheating on his girlfriend in texts on his phone. He was sexting with some random woman, she read in graphic detail what he wanted to do with her (my kid was 11). And she told his girlfriend and sent her screenshots.

When he found out he grabbed her and screamed in her face. He kept telling her that he could have rightfully hit her in that moment and she should be thankful he was a good enough man he didn't, even though she didn't deserve his restraint. He made her promise not to tell me because it wasn't my business and I would blow it out of proportion and make him the bad guy, as usual. The weekends after he kept repeating his threats to her every time she visited until she finally told me.

Hearing something like that was my greatest fear. I decided to be honest with her and share a little bit of my history with him. Just enough so she would understand that it was not her fault, but that was a very dark side of him she had only seen once before and never directed at her. I then explained our options: 

- taking it to court, making his behaviour public

- trying to talk it out

- grey rocking

We discussed the pros and cons and I made sure to let her know I would support her and fight for her and I would make sure he could never do that again. And we decided together grey rock him. We didn't reach out at all anymore. When he asked her to visit him, I told him she had plans, she was sick, she was invited to a birthday party, she had to study for tests etc. He tried to argue sometimes, but eventually gave up. 

At some point, after a series of rants from his side and trying to manipulate us with ominous threats of self-harm, I told him I wasn't available for that kind of bullshit anymore and he could always send me a letter if he needed something (like oldschool, with a stamp and stuff - he never did) and that I would block him now for good. And I did. 

He did try to use her as a messenger for a while, of course, but I shot that down real very fast. I stabilized financially and finally got a court order for child support. I'm now debt-free and haven't needed his financial support for years anymore, so all his payments are saved for my kid. I'm truely Independent. I'm free.

2025

My daughter just turned 17.

She hasn't seen him or really talked to him in 5 years. She hasn't blocked him, but doesn't engage much either. She has accepted who he is and stays away from him. 

Of course she did some more therapy over the years and has grown into the most incredible person. She is a smart, kind, loyal, funny and bubbly kid. She's happy. She knows what she wants and has the best bullshit detector I have ever seen. She's confident and strong and silly. She trusts me and she loves spending time with me and that makes me so happy and thankful. 

She is the reason I wanted to write my story out for you. She's the best thing I've ever done and I'm so proud of her and proud of myself. I did it. We did it. We made it out and we found happiness. It was so hard, but it was worth the fight. She was worth every fight.

Sometimes I still can't believe that I really did it on my own, that we are safe and the memories come back. I'm ok with these moments. They are not wounds anymore, they are scars that are proof of how much stronger I am now. Most of the time I'm just overwhelmed with happiness and grateful for the life I was able to build. I did that! I made it! I found love (for real this time) and have been with my wonderful, supportive and kind husband for years now. My kid and him are best buddies. Life is good.

I want you to know that you CAN get out and have a good life. It may take years and you will keep making mistakes, but that is ok. Just focus on your yourself. You can continue healing. You deserve that. You can get there. Keep going. ❤️","I did it! Warning: Very very long!

Trigger warning (DV/SA/mention of SH)

Hi everyone,

My daughter recently turned 17 and it just hit me that it will only be one more year that we are legally tied to her father. I've been counting down the time since she was 3 and I would like to share our story. I will be very honest and won't try to sugarcoat my own stupid decisions along the way. It is a very long story and there is still so much more that wouldn't fit in here, but I don't know how I could make it any shorter. Please feel free to ask me anything. Maybe it can help some of you or give you a little bit of hope. Or just keep you from making the same mistakes. Or maybe I'm just yelling it out into the void. Here we go.

1997

I met my ex when I was 15, he was 21. He approached me and was very blunt about being intererested in me. I was an angsty teen, lonely, insecure and arrogant and he was challenging and charismatic and his interest in me made me feel good. Nobody was ever really interested in me before. We dated for a while, until his fiancé (that I didn't know of) called me on my 16th birthday out of the blue. 

I had gone out with him and his friends many times and found out they covered for him and one of them must have finally told her. The next day he convinced her that nothing romantic ever happened and I was basically stalking him (while me and my parents were on the phone with them), even though even my parents confirmed to her that he introduced himself as my boyfriend and was in our house many times. She believed him. I couldn't wrap my head around how someone could lie to my face like that, it felt so bizarre. I moved on.

2000/2001

I then met him again 3 years later, he pretended to want a friendship for a while, then tried to get back together with me, got mad when I refused because I had a boyfriend and left my life again for some years.

2006/2007

5 1/2 years later we met again online. We started writing every day and met in person after a month and the sparks were back. The bad memories felt so long ago, we were different people now. We started dating again, it felt like the greatest lovestory ever. He proposed fast and talked about how I was meant to be the mother of his children. I got pregnant within 5 months. He was happy first until realisation hit him, I guess - and he confessed that he was married and couldn't leave his wife for financial reasons. After lots of fights and tears I conceded and decided to play along for the sake of my child, who I already loved so much. She was born in early 2008.

2008/2009

We lived in 2 separate cities and for about two years he visited me every other weekend-ish. He kept telling me that his marriage and his wife were his business to handle and if I would interfere I would destroy everything. So I kept playing along and stayed out of it. He wasn't there when our daughter was born and he left me alone with our newborn child when I came home from the hospital with a flu and a 40°C fever.

He didn't pay child support, he wasn't available when I needed him (because I couldn't call him) and he got angry when I was desperate and burnt out and eventually broke down from the stress of being a single mother to a child with semi-chronic illnesses (she fortunately grew out of it), with no other real family anymore except for my low-contact sister who lives 4 hours away, no support system and no money, so I had to balance work and being there for my sick kid and everything else. I lived in an appartment he owned (bought with his wifes signature on the loan) and he made me pay rent. I basically made minus 500 bucks every month and couldn't even apply for government support because I would have had to name him and he gaslit me into thinking that that would destroy everything financially at that time if his wife found out. He told me to stop complaining about being overwhelmed because others do it too (I also realized years later I most likely had PPD). 

He expected me to be available for sex whenever he came over and didn't really care about my consent (yeah, it only clicked years later what that actually was..). I grew resentful. He became jealous of the new and only (female) friend I had (I'm not even bi), because we spent a lot of time together, helping each other with our kids.

2010

When our kid was 2 years old, I finally had enough and broke up with him. So then he decided the time was right to finally tell his wife. He came to me, told me he told everyone (including his parents who were incredibly mad at him for keeping their first grandchild a secret for two years) and expected me to jump right into playing happy family, like flipping a switch.

I tried for a while, thinking that that was all I ever wanted and he wasn't lying after all when he always promised we would be together one day. I finally won, right?

As much as I wanted to be happy, but realizing little things started grating on me. Like how now I could just easily take a shower if I needed to when he was there made me realize what he robbed me off. It started to get to me how much easier it could have been. But I decided to give it a try, now that I finally had him. 

He understood that I didn't want to move into a house with him and his parents right away, so he decided we should buy a house somewhere else. He found one he liked, a 1 1/2 h drive away from my job, in the middle of nowhere. I told him I would love to find the perfect place for both of us, but this was not it for me. 

He went absolutely crazy. He started spamming all my email-adresses, calling me the c-,b- and w-word and a liar and many other things. I was at work at the time and completely shocked by the sudden hate. To this day I don't know why this triggered him so hard.

Soon after I found out I was pregnant again. I went no contact after his attacks, but felt obligated to tell him and his tone shifted immediately. I told him I wasn't excited about having another child with him and he told me he would support any decision I would make. After some hard internal back and forth I decided to have an abortion. When I told him after it was done, he immediately switched back to being aggressive, only this time with more direct threats (very graphic violent ideations of what he would do to me, promising to destroy every part of my life), as well as contacting colleagues of mine he had never met and remembered the names of, to tell them in detail what a horrible person I am and that I unalived his baby. And he broke into my place, just to show me that he could. And then he evicted me from his appartment that I paid rent for.

So I took him to court for harrassment. That put me in more debt, but I got a restraining order and supervised visits at a neutral agency out of it and started to heal a little bit after all this chaos. No direct contact.

Until my sister's wedding a few months later. My kid was a flowergirl and one of the photos was so precious, so cute that I couldn't help but wanting to share this special moment with him. So I sent it to him and we started talking again. He apologized like nobody every apologized to me before. He wrote me a letter where it seemed like he read my mind and really understood deeply all the things he had done wrong. He was so sure I was the one. We decided to try one last time. Take it slow this time. I moved in with him 3 months later, into his house, with his parents. I told myself I wanted to give it one last shot, so I would at the very least never feel like I didn't try hard enough to give my kid a complete family.

As soon as I moved in, he lost all interest in me. He expected me to keep the house clean, cook, take care of our daughter and work, of course. I was the only breadwinner at the time. He was convinced providing the house we live in (that he inherited from his grandmother) was enough and spent his time gaming, doing some shady side business with people I didn't know or doing god knows what. 

During this time we/he used up my entire small inheritance (I got 10k right around the time he evicted me) on his debts and his unemployment. When the money was gone, he wanted me to ask my sister for money and I drew a very hard line. We fought a lot at that time. I worked nightshifts every weekend and stayed with a friend in the city from Friday to Monday, we lived about an hour away and I didn't like driving at night so much. When we got into a fight one evening I told him I wanted to leave. I was in the bedroom, packing. My kid with me. He started shouting, calling me names, mocking me. When I wanted to leave he blocked the door. When I tried to push through, he shoved me hard against the doorframe and I fell and hit my head. I'll never forget my kid screaming and crying in fear. She also still remembers (she was 3). He didn't let me go. He broke me a little bit more that night. I knew I needed to get out, but I didn't know how.

2011

One day when I came back home from work, I found long, coloured hair in our shower and in the bed that definitely wasn't mine. He presented some bs theory to brush it off and I knew something was up, but I knew I needed proof. When I confronted him he tried to gaslight me, called me crazy, saying that I was trying to break our family apart. I started investigating. Luckily (yes, really) one day he got into a little accident with my car and the inconsistencies of how it happened gave me some clues and I ended up finding his AP. I packed my kid and our most important stuff and left the same day while he was out.

When he found out he completely lost it. In a call he jumped back and forth from begging and offering to give me his house if I'd come back to promising to destroy me for taking his child away from him, often mid-sentence, sometimes laughing and shouting and crying at the same time. When I had to return for important documents and made his mother promise he wouldn't be there, he was waiting for me in the driveway with a knife in his hand. I was terrified and refused to enter the house.

I left and got a spot at a women's shelter. Words can not describe how guilty and relieved I felt when the social worker there assured me I could block him everywhere, we would proceed via official channels only and he could not take our child away from me because of that. And they helped me get my daughter into therapy to help her through this trauma. He tried to dictate his conditions to every single person he interacted with and the case worker said she never met anyone so assertive and aggressive and manipulative in her whole carreer, and she was dealing with DV-cases for over 30 years.

2012

After months of fights through third parties and court dates we started coparenting. He still wasn't paying any child support even though he did work at the time. He once told me on the phone that if I'd ever go after him officially for child support, he'd just keep on quitting his job (in our country my application would then be suspended). And when I tried he actually did. He said he didn't want me to have his money after I ruined him and that's obviously all I ever cared about.

So I started insisting on written communication only. He tried to scare/force me into verbal agreements for a while and attacked me constantly in an attempt to gain control back (and I had panic attacks every time I got a message from him), but I stood firm. No more unrecorded 1on1 conversations he could twist afterwards. 

I found an appartment in the city, found a daycare for my kid and found the grey rock method. My mental health was at rock bottom. I was happy to be out, but still scared and had panic attacks. I started having outbursts of uncontrollable anger and got scared of myself. And then I finally started therapy for myself. 

2013

It all calmed down slowly, but gradually and we both started seeing new people.

19155,1i6kqof,post,One-sided friendships are starting to weigh on me,"Just need to let this out because I’ve been overthinking a lot lately, and I don’t know if it’s just me being ""mababaw"" or OA. 



So, I’ve been feeling off about this one circle of friends I have. They made a separate GC without me, and I kind of pieced it together from their IG stories. Every time I joke about joining them or say, “How about me naman?” they’d reply with stuff like, “This was unexpected!” But then I see their FB posts or comments about their “chika sa GC,” which I’m clearly not part of.



I know it sounds mababaw, but it makes me feel left out. To add to that, they don’t really seem supportive of me either. When our other friends update their profiles or post something, they hype each other up with comments like “wow ganda!” or “proud of you,” but they never do that for me. I know I sound OA, but it stings sometimes.



Now, about my boyfriend—he stays in the same apartment as some of these friends. They always tease and belittle him, calling him a “microcheater” just because he sometimes hangs out with his girl friends (which I’m totally okay with). They make it a big deal like, “Patay ka kay (me)” when he hangs out with a prettier girl, even though I’ve always trusted him.



What they don’t seem to realize is that my boyfriend’s friendships with these girls are completely platonic. He’s always had girl friends even before we got together, and he treats them like sisters. What’s ironic is that some of these same friends are also in platonic boy-and-girl friendships with each other, even though they’re in relationships with other people. If I were to flip the situation and tell them to stop hanging out with their guy or girl friends because of their partners, they’d definitely raise an eyebrow. It feels so hypocritical.



For context, I used to be super selosa in the first few years of our relationship—like tracking his location, checking his accounts, Life360, the works. But I’ve grown past that. I let him be, and we’ve set boundaries that we both respect. He’s just naturally friendly, like a golden retriever type of guy, and I trust him completely now.



Recently, my boyfriend told me he felt like these friends (who are also his friends) were backstabbing him and even mocking our relationship. He mentioned seeing one of them repost a TikTok about microcheating, and they commented stuff like, “Send this to your friend the microcheater,” or “No, yung girl lang siguro friend ko, not the boy.” At first, I told him not to overthink it, but now I’m overthinking too.



What gets to me the most is the idea that they might be backstabbing or mocking us when they could easily talk to me about any issues. I’ve always been open to adjusting or hearing them out. They also criticize how me and my boyfriend joke around (we curse each other for fun—“b\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*” “f\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*” “y\\\*\\\*a” etc.), but it’s literally just our humor. We both know when we’re joking and when we’re serious. There was just this one time when we shouted and cursed each other “y\\\*\\\*a” when we had a big fight, just once, but that’s just and it didn’t happen again.



I used to think I was okay with stuff like this, but it’s been piling up, and now it really gets to me. I’ve realized that I probably have some FOMO, but what hurts more is thinking that maybe they don’t value this friendship the same way I do. I know I’ve been genuine with them, and I don’t think I’ve done anything wrong, but it still makes me feel sad and out of place.



I’m not sure what to feel. It makes me sad because I really value this friendship, but I also don’t want to keep feeling like I’m the only one putting in the effort. Friendships should go both ways, and I also don't want friendship that keeps me begging for reciprocity. For now, I guess I just need to figure out what’s best for my peace of mind without overthinking too much.","One-sided friendships are starting to weigh on me Just need to let this out because I’ve been overthinking a lot lately, and I don’t know if it’s just me being ""mababaw"" or OA. 



So, I’ve been feeling off about this one circle of friends I have. They made a separate GC without me, and I kind of pieced it together from their IG stories. Every time I joke about joining them or say, “How about me naman?” they’d reply with stuff like, “This was unexpected!” But then I see their FB posts or comments about their “chika sa GC,” which I’m clearly not part of.



I know it sounds mababaw, but it makes me feel left out. To add to that, they don’t really seem supportive of me either. When our other friends update their profiles or post something, they hype each other up with comments like “wow ganda!” or “proud of you,” but they never do that for me. I know I sound OA, but it stings sometimes.



Now, about my boyfriend—he stays in the same apartment as some of these friends. They always tease and belittle him, calling him a “microcheater” just because he sometimes hangs out with his girl friends (which I’m totally okay with). They make it a big deal like, “Patay ka kay (me)” when he hangs out with a prettier girl, even though I’ve always trusted him.



What they don’t seem to realize is that my boyfriend’s friendships with these girls are completely platonic. He’s always had girl friends even before we got together, and he treats them like sisters. What’s ironic is that some of these same friends are also in platonic boy-and-girl friendships with each other, even though they’re in relationships with other people. If I were to flip the situation and tell them to stop hanging out with their guy or girl friends because of their partners, they’d definitely raise an eyebrow. It feels so hypocritical.



For context, I used to be super selosa in the first few years of our relationship—like tracking his location, checking his accounts, Life360, the works. But I’ve grown past that. I let him be, and we’ve set boundaries that we both respect. He’s just naturally friendly, like a golden retriever type of guy, and I trust him completely now.



Recently, my boyfriend told me he felt like these friends (who are also his friends) were backstabbing him and even mocking our relationship. He mentioned seeing one of them repost a TikTok about microcheating, and they commented stuff like, “Send this to your friend the microcheater,” or “No, yung girl lang siguro friend ko, not the boy.” At first, I told him not to overthink it, but now I’m overthinking too.



What gets to me the most is the idea that they might be backstabbing or mocking us when they could easily talk to me about any issues. I’ve always been open to adjusting or hearing them out. They also criticize how me and my boyfriend joke around (we curse each other for fun—“b\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*” “f\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*” “y\\\*\\\*a” etc.), but it’s literally just our humor. We both know when we’re joking and when we’re serious.

Don't know how to start this. I (f34) am in a relationship with a wonderful guy, we want to marry at some point, maybe have kids.

19157,1i6nc1s,post,I'm so fucking tired of my friends,"to start off sorry for my bad English, it's not my first language

I'm genuinely so fucking stressed out and tired all the fucking time, I absolutelly love and adore my friends especially these two who I consider my best friends, lets call them V and D. So, we all struggle with depression, anxiety and other mental health issues, I don't really consider this in itself a problem since they are very sweet people BUT they are so suicidal I can't anymore, I don't think I can be friends with them anymore considering how their suicidal behavior is affecting my mental health but I know that if I leave them, they defo will kill themselves.

  
This all started like a month or two ago when me, V, D and many other of our friends were planning on going to a cosplay convention, I was so exited you don't even know, it was my first con with V! We would often talk about our plans for the con at school, it was all fun and games untill I found out something, V and D share an extracurricular (?) activity with each other, I'm not with them bc I didn't get in. But anyways, I found out that when they were in the classes together they had been planning on killing themselves right after the con, when I heard this I got absolutely shoked and scared, i started begging them to not do it in multiple long looong messages. this did not stop them. they kept and kept on talking about killing themselves in detail, it got to the point that I had multiple panic attacks at school bc of them and I had to leave in the middle of the day. The con finally arrived and they both lived, why? not because I finally talked them out of it, but because D had gotten sick. That was it for a while. and by a while I mean two weeks.

  
Stuff like this just kept and kept on happening, I get that they have mental health struggles but so do I!! this is extremely exhausting. I'm going to skip the other attempts that I had to talk them out of since I don't have energy to write all that.

  
So, on sunday, after getting home from a fun day out with my friends I just came out from the shower, I sit on my bed and I open my phone, ready to just doomscroll tiktok for a couple hours, I notice a whatsapp notification from D ""okay, meaby he needs to talk to someome, it's fine"" I open the message and to my horror, it was a looooong suicide note, fuck. I started to panic as expected I keep telling him not to do it and that this isn't the way to happiness and all that other stuff, I finally think I might have managed to talk him out of it after TWO HOURS, in that two hours I had had a panic attac and a huge cry about it. okay, I've calmed down at this point only to open my phone to a LONG ASS SUICIDE NOT FROM V. FUCK. I literally beg and beg and beg them to not do it, I call them and everything! finally they promised to stay alive. atleast untill monday.

  
yesterday, the same thing happened again, aparently D had taken 2600mg of painkillers and was thinking of taking more, we both panic together, I try to calm V down while they try to calm D down, finally atleast V calmed down (D lived btw) but honestly I was feeling jealous, jealous of how V cares more for D than she does for me. I took some painkillers too (legit almost the same amount) to get myself to sleep, I wake up pissed bc of what happened last night and the night before, I haven't been able to sleep in the slightest. at school, V just keeps talking about D or about these girls she hates, I just stick with her bc she is my only friend in our class. After school I felt really depressed so I  went to the nearby store to buy a bunch of sweets, eating is one of my coping mechanisms. After multiple hours of just eating and staring at screens, I was feeling a bit better, I even started to clean up my room! (super proud) but then, the messages came back in.

""(my name) fuck please answer D is thinking about doing it again!"" ""im so stressed"" DO YOU NOT KNOW HOW STRESSED I HAVE BEEN THESE LAST TWO FUCKING MONTHS???? EVERYDAY IM SCARED THAT THOSE TWO KILL THEMSELVES. and V legit only texts me when she's thinking about killing herself or that D is thinking about killing himself. im so fucking tired. I have no motivation for anything anymore. am I a bad person for not really caring for them being suicidal anymore? I feel as my depression (diagnosed btw) has just gotten worse and worse.

19158,1i6ndtc,post,To wait for warmth,"It just feels forbidden.

To yearn for warmth that is close enough to know the name of yet not close enough to know the feeling of.

Why can’t you just, stop being you.

You tell me about your problems yet it only makes me upset.

You tell me about this guy you’ve met even after knowing me. Why am I second place? You rant and rant about how he’s awful, yet you choose to meet him over me. 

You tell me you haven’t slept all night yet my texts sit cold even when you know how happy it would make me to hear from you.

You say “I’ve slept for over 24 hours” and the words “Can’t you lie better?” almost slip from my lips. 

You talk about how miserable you are at your job, I try to talk you out of it, you tell me you got a new job, I’m happy because maybe now I can see you- you decide to keep both jobs to stay with your friends.

I thought, you would make time…for me?

Like you happily told me again and again. With your 1000 date ideas that made me laugh.

But when? 

I told you when I’m free and you ignore me.

I tell you that I’m excited and you disappear.

I tell you…Oh what’s the point in telling,

He’s too focused on his job.

There’s no room for me.

I think I should just stop. Maybe just being friends would be better?

Maybe then I can hang up the “Idealized lunch break” title and let myself be.

 Everytime he speaks I yearn for him, not in an idealized way like he thinks romance is.

I love him. I know him. And a relationship for him is a want not a need, a want that he can’t even afford right now.

Tell me why I play the waiting game for someone that I don’t even know the warmth of.

Someone that I question myself on. 

Someone that will never make time for me with all the rest of the things he needs to deal with.

The waiting game is chipping me down like water breaking a rock down crack by crack.

I hate this, I hate doubting and turning inward.

I hate this familiar game. Waiting for something to come home, waiting for a relationship to love on both sides again, waiting for…

And waiting for…

Am I just too much to be the second choice? Maybe a glanced at 3rd place or barely scratched by 5th place? 

You say you want a relationship but do nothing but dream about it. This is reality. 

Come stupid dance with me. Come explore those shops with me. Come get blisters with me. Come explore life with me until my family has a seat for you at the table. Come laugh until tears. Come cry until smiles. Come try. Come choose.

Come be with me.

I won’t beg you to your face, it is no pressure to love me as it is no pressure to love you. I will write until I can leave this negativity here and look at you the same. 

If you make time, I will pick up my shoes instead of my pen. Pick up my smile instead of fallen tears.

You are not my idealized love, you are the love I love regardless of cracks and time.

Come home to the house you’ve built in my mind, so I can stop waiting at the door.

19159,1i6nici,post,Best Friend Accusing Me Of Lying,"This came out of total left field and I just need to get it off my chest.

About a week ago my friend brought up Rednote as a TikTok alternative and I mentioned that I didn't like it. The language barrier was the main thing but it also was nothing like TikTok. I thought I made it clear that I had tried it and left it.

She brought it up a few more times, but since it didn't really interest me, I kinda just brushed the suggestions aside. She mentioned last night downloading it cause she really liked it and I told that maybe I would.

Well apparently I'm a liar and I hid it from her that I had used the app. At first I thought she was talking about that I didn't share my account with her. I found no reason to cause I don't use it and I had even deleted the app a few days ago.

Nope. Apparently I had been pretending not to know what it was or something? I thought I made it clear that I was aware of it and that I just wasn't interested! I even told her as much, but she keeps insisting I didn't and that I'm lying to her/keeping secrets.

Idk what to do. Maybe I am remembering wrong and I told someone else that I wasn't interested and thought I told her, so my nonanswers when she brought it up seemed odd, but I could have sworn I did. But I know I never said I hadn't heard of it or anything.. it's true I don't have it or use it and maybe she interpreted that as I never did?

To make matters worse, she found out via a video I posted on there and willingly shared with her. She saw the water mark and got upset. But I knew it had the water mark and I knew she'd see it but I didn't have anything to hide so I didn't keep it from her. I didn't think twice when sharing it. I told her all this and she still doesn't believe me.

Idk I just feel really hurt rn and like she doesn't trust me. I've never lied to her and idk why she thinks I'd start now, especially over something so miniscule.","Best Friend Accusing Me Of Lying This came out of total left field and I just need to get it off my chest.

Humanity had the solution to every problem at its fingertips and yet choose extinction. And because of that they deserve it. Its going to be the biggest, saddest, smuggest i told you so in the history of the known universe.",0,4,2025-01-21 17:23,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1i6ntx8/my_whole_life_ive_been_on_the_outside_of_humanity/,Neutral
19163,1i6nvxw,post,Can’t handle constant negativity anymore ,"My fiance is 35 and I am 36. I have three kids from a previous marriage that ended a long time ago. A while back, he interviewed and got offered a job that is 2 hours away. For two months, I listened every single day as he vented and discussed his thoughts and worries and concerns. I heard and was there for him as he went back and forth. Many times, it was confusing to me. He even told me that at first, he thought well, if things don’t work out with her, atleast I’ll be in a place I like better and a job I like better. I supported him and I started looking at jobs, etc. in order for him to take this job, it would mean uprooting all of our lives, leaving our families and jobs, to go there. It was very difficult, but I stayed patient and strong with him and was just there for him. I told him that no matter where we were, we would make it work and that I loved him. I encouraged him. I told him if he wanted to stay, too, that that’s okay as well. He took the job and then the last two weeks or so, he’s been absolutely bonkers second guessing his decision and going insane. He has cried, he has been depressed, anxious. I have continued to be there, although it has sometimes been very difficult. He made the decision not to go, he told me he did not want to uproot the kids and me and that he cares for our families and that’s important for when we have a baby and he doesn’t want to leave them. He said being with me has changed his priorities and that he has different ideas about what makes him happy in life. It all sounded nice and romantic and it sounded so secure and happy. And I let him reach this decision on his own, although I was there for him every step of the way. Yet, since he declined the second time, he has been going bonkers. He seems miserable. He told me he wasn’t even this sad when his ex broke up with him. He said that he thinks he made a terrible choice and he has been very negative about the things we want to do here, like have a baby and buy a home. I’ve tried to be encouraging and patient and I’ve told him that we have each other and we make 150,000 a year together. I’ve told him that we can do the things we want to, we just work the logistics out together and budget. We be patient. And he says he just doesn’t know if he can have the life he wants here. Says he wants a huge house and he wants fine foods and things like that. And he can’t do that on 150,000 a year. Last night, he was so down, I was feeling so tense yesterday. All of this has just built up because I’ve been putting myself on the back burner and there have been things that have stung. He made a comment about how he used to be just planning for two, now he’s planning for 4, bringing up his ex again. This was a problem for a while in our relationship. I told him I was a little tired of hearing about his ex and I felt we should move on from the past. I am not her (she is a doctor) and I am me. I am a teacher and I have worked very hard (2 Masters degrees and a PhD). I make pretty okay money. And I take care of my life and kids. It makes me feel terrible to hear how miserable he thinks his life will be because he stayed. It also makes me feel awful to hear things about his ex. I communicated this to him, we got into a spat. We rarely argue and usually do great and discussing things and talking them out and we still did, but he made a comment we should go 9 months at a time without arguing and that there’s no reason we need to argue. I just felt fed up a little bit. I’ve spent the last days with him playing games and relaxing so he can feel better. He said to me earlier that he’s scared about buying a house for us here )although I would also be buying it) because what if in 6 months the kids don’t want him around or he does all this stuff for them and they don't respect him? That didn’t make sense to me. When he says things like this, it makes me feel his major fear of commitment. He is scared to death to make any decisions. I am conflicted and I want to know what is the best thing for me to do here in terms of fixing this. I ask what he wants and he says he doesn’t know what he wants and I ask how to best be there for him, he said he doesn’t know. And then he made a comment last night that through this, he wishes he had a partner who pushed him to take that job. It felt awful because I’ve worked my ass off to make sure I’m there for him and am positive about him taking that job and told him over and over I wanted him to be happy. He went back to work today and he's been miserable, was angry and miserable this morning. Was still talking about the job he passed on. And I was telling him I was there for him and telling him I looked so forward to our future together, like game nights and family vacations. He responds, ""I don't think we can afford that."" I'm very close to telling him I can no longer tolerate the constant negativity about our life. ","Can’t handle constant negativity anymore  My fiance is 35 and I am 36.

19164,1i6nx48,post,Why are people decorating nurseries for adults? ,"This post will probably come off as judgmental and it probably so judgmental, but I’m seeing so much of it. 

Currently pregnant. Our nursery/baby room is in the works and I’m in pregnancy groups on different social medias. 

I get that you can change the nursery for when the baby gets a little older and starts getting into stuff (crawling!), but are you really going to want to or be able to afford a complete room make over in 7-12 months? 

I’ve seen lamps with exposed bulbs. That’s an easy take down. 
Sharp edges on all the furniture. 
Art that belongs in your dining room. 
Vintage toys with flaky paint that is probably lead based paint. 
Nothing colorful - all aesthetic. 
Sometimes other than a crib and a dresser there’s nothing actually for the baby - a bunch of stuff that’s pretty, but will have to be removed (large vases, bronze figurines from Marshall’s, fake flowers with little beads that can be swallowed)

Nothing that is actually useful for you to take care of the baby, and nothing for the baby who will not always be a baby. 

It’s so much adult aesthetic and so little “this room is FOR my CHILD.” 

I hope the children’s books are in a different room! 

The room we’re setting up is for our kid. They won’t need or use it much the first 6-12 months, but it’ll fit great until they’re old enough to tell me they want a make over and what they want. It’s built for safety so I’m not scrambling once they start crawling and are bonking their head. 

I just don’t get it. The rooms are beautiful, but your 2 year olds likes aren’t likely to fit the aesthetic. ","Why are people decorating nurseries for adults?  This post will probably come off as judgmental and it probably so judgmental, but I’m seeing so much of it.

19165,1i6o0mb,post,Feeling really down.,"It’s hard to put into words just how much pain I’m in right now. Everything feels so overwhelming, and it’s like the world has been collapsing around me for the past six months. When I first came to this private boarding school, I had so much hope. I wanted this to be a fresh start, a chance to become someone admired, someone respected. I wanted people to look at me and see someone worth knowing, someone who mattered. But everything has fallen apart so quickly, and I don’t even know who I am anymore.

It started with my roommates. From the moment I moved in, they were rude, disruptive, and downright cruel. They constantly picked on me, bullying me and making me feel small. The group chat, which should have been a way to connect with people, became another place where I was mocked and ridiculed. I tried to be kind, to show respect, to be the better person, but instead of earning their respect, it felt like they took my kindness as a weakness to exploit. No matter how much effort I put into being a good person, I was treated like I didn’t matter, like I was invisible.

And then there’s “A.” He’s everything I wish I could be and more. He’s taller than me, better-looking, and naturally popular. He has the confidence and charisma that draw people to him without him even trying. I can’t help but compare myself to him constantly, and every time I do, I come up short. Even in soccer, which is something I’m genuinely good at, he’s the one who gets all the attention. I know I’m better at soccer—I’ve worked hard for it, and I know I have the skills—but no one seems to notice. “A” is the one everyone looks at, the one everyone admires. It’s like nothing I do will ever be enough to make people see me the way they see him.

The list was the breaking point. When the ‘hottest boys’ list leaked, it confirmed everything I’ve been afraid of. Over ten girls from every grade contributed to that list, and “A” was on it, of course. But I wasn’t even mentioned. It’s not just about the list—it’s about what it represents. It’s about how people see me—or don’t see me at all. I’ve always held onto this tiny hope that maybe, just maybe, people would notice me for how I look. Even if I felt like I was failing in other areas, I thought I might at least have that. But now, even that hope is gone. The list was a reminder that I’m invisible, that I’m not worth noticing, that I don’t matter.

Then there’s the girl I like. I liked her so much, and I thought there was a chance, no matter how small, that she might feel the same way. But then she got a boyfriend, and it wasn’t me. The worst part is knowing that if it had been “A” she liked, she wouldn’t have left him for someone else. “A” would have been enough for her, but I wasn’t. And it’s not just her. Two of my friends left me for “A,” too. They chose him over me, just like everyone else seems to. It’s like no matter what I do, no matter how hard I try, I’m always the one left behind.

I hate so much about myself. My height is a constant reminder that I don’t measure up—literally and figuratively. At 5’5”, I feel like I’m stuck looking up at everyone else, and it makes me feel so small, so unimportant. My weight, my face, my everything—it all feels wrong. I’ve even started hating my body because of my nasal polyps. I can’t breathe through my nose, which forces me to mouth-breathe, and it’s embarrassing. It’s one of the reasons I don’t play soccer with my friends anymore. I’m too ashamed. I can’t even enjoy the things I used to love because of all these insecurities weighing me down.

Everywhere I turn, there’s another reminder of how much I’m failing. I thought I could make a difference here, that I could be someone worth remembering. But instead, I feel like a shadow, always overlooked, always in the background. People take advantage of my respect and kindness, twisting it into something they can use against me. I feel so weak, so powerless. And every time “A” walks into a room, it’s like the spotlight follows him while I’m left standing in the dark.

All of these things—the bullying, the rejection, the comparisons, the list, the girl, the friends who left, my own insecurities—keep piling up, and I can’t escape them. It’s like I’m drowning, and no one even notices. I feel so unworthy of love, respect, or attention. I feel invisible, like I could disappear tomorrow, and it wouldn’t matter to anyone. The worst part is how quickly everything has spiraled. Six months ago, I had hope. Now, I feel like I have nothing.

I just want someone to see me, to really see me, and tell me that I matter. I want to feel like I’m enough, like I’m worth something. But right now, all I feel is pain. All I see is the shadow of who I thought I could be, slipping further and further away. I don’t know how much more of this I can take. I’m tired of feeling like I’ll never measure up, that I’ll never be good enough. I’m tired of being left behind.","Feeling really down.

19169,1i6obky,post,In laws make me go mad,"Short back story about my relationship with my bodyfriend: 

I have been together with him for more than 5 years. We are now building our home. My boyfriend has a construction company and we build our house on our own with the help of both of our families. We have a very good relationship and are like best friends. We can talk about everything. My boyfriend knows that his parents aren't easy and he also knows that they weren't perfect parents. He feels very comfortable in my home, because my parents treat him like family. My boyfriend has in the past years always defended me in front of his parents. There have been a lot of fights between him and his parents about it. At last he gave up with them and tells me to give up on them too, because they won't better themselves. As an example he tells me ""Why would they change for you, if they don't change for their own child""...... It's sad and I wish i could give it a rest, but i can't really. 

 Yesterday we were at his parents house. We sleep at his and mine on different days. We had breakfast and his father started his usual narcissitic rant about what my boyfried has to do in the house and what he (FIL) will do in our house. He kind of likes to tell us what to do, as if we and my bf, who owns a company, are stupid. I ignored it and sometimes leave a little tease if it gets too much like ""yeah, do what daddy says"" in front of them, which makes him shut up but makes the whole power-fight that my in-laws do more intense. And I don't like to give it a rest, because this will be my home. And I am and have always been air to them. They talked about my parents badly in front of me, body-shamed me, shamed my education and my job, called me ex-girlfriends name on purpose and turn around or don't look at me, if I come around. I am air to them. When we started buying stuff for our future home the first question they asked was ""How would you share it, if you seperated?"" 

In yesterdays rant FIL manipulated bf and turned the conversation around like my bf was the one, that talked nonesense and FIL shames him and tells him what to do. I laughed. FIL told me to shut up ""girlie"". I told him ""No, this is our home and we decide what we do"". He told me ""I don't decide anything. i don't know anything and my parents don't decide anything too."" Bf knew that I was heating up and tried to cool the situation. MIL sat around ignored and listened, like always. I left the breakfast table with a push to my boyfriend ""let the girlie stand up."" I got soooooo fucking angry because all of this stupid manipulation and this ignoring and abuse thing that has been going on makes me so angry and sad. I just exploded and had an out of body experience. Told my boyfriend to get it together and tell FIL off, bf didn't, because he thought it was of no use. I said a few not so appropriate things to FIL and left the house and went to the construction side because I knew my bf and FIL would work there. 

I called my parents. If FIL mixes in, my parents will too. My parents know the whole abuse story and know how to handle this better with me, so they went there and talked to him. I told father in law off there and told him that this is my home and that he will not intervene. Bf told him too.  He stormed off the construction side as if it was the most outlandish thing ever. My dad stopped him and talked to him. Got to him a little and FIL hugged me. Lmao. Never have I been hugged by this person. 


The abuse still hangs in the air and I feel like a wounded animal. It is always in my mind. I always think about their manipulations and their words. I have gotten to a point, where it just makes me sick.
Short description: my in-laws treat me like I am air, think they can have every privilege they want and overstep boundaries.

FIL told me to shut up ""girlie"". I told him ""No, this is our home and we decide what we do"". He told me ""I don't decide anything. i don't know anything and my parents don't decide anything too."" Bf knew that I was heating up and tried to cool the situation. MIL sat around ignored and listened, like always. I left the breakfast table with a push to my boyfriend ""let the girlie stand up."" I got soooooo fucking angry because all of this stupid manipulation and this ignoring and abuse thing that has been going on makes me so angry and sad. I just exploded and had an out of body experience. Told my boyfriend to get it together and tell FIL off, bf didn't, because he thought it was of no use. I said a few not so appropriate things to FIL and left the house and went to the construction side because I knew my bf and FIL would work there. 

I called my parents. If FIL mixes in, my parents will too. My parents know the whole abuse story and know how to handle this better with me, so they went there and talked to him. I told father in law off there and told him that this is my home and that he will not intervene. Bf told him too.  He stormed off the construction side as if it was the most outlandish thing ever. My dad stopped him and talked to him. Got to him a little and FIL hugged me. Lmao. Never have I been hugged by this person. 


The abuse still hangs in the air and I feel like a wounded animal. It is always in my mind. I always think about their manipulations and their words. I have gotten to a point, where it just makes me sick.
Short description: my in-laws treat me like I am air, think they can have every privilege they want and overstep boundaries.

19171,1i6odzm,post,"I Want to Change, but I Feel Trapped in Old Patterns","I’ve been feeling stuck in a cycle of procrastination and self-sabotage, and I don’t know how to break free. I have so many dreams and goals, but I can’t seem to get started. I’m overwhelmed by how much I want to change, but I feel like I’m dragging this invisible weight behind me.

Growing up, my parents were strict, especially my father. He was often critical, calling me names like ‘lazy’ or ‘useless.’ I rarely felt like I was good enough. My mother wasn’t very involved, and I didn’t have much emotional support. I struggled in school and felt like I could never measure up. Even now, I hear those voices in my head when I try to push myself to do something.

I think a lot of my procrastination comes from fear—fear of failure, fear of not being good enough, fear of proving that voice in my head right. I get paralyzed and avoid things that matter to me, even though I know it’s hurting me. I also struggle with self-discipline because part of me just wants to avoid discomfort, even if it means I stay stuck.

I want to be consistent. I want to build better habits and take care of myself. I don’t want to feel like I’m wasting my potential anymore. But it’s so hard to take the first step, and I don’t know how to stop this cycle of inaction. I feel like I’m fighting against a part of myself that just wants to stay in my comfort zone.

Has anyone else dealt with this? How do you start moving forward when you feel so stuck? How do you heal from a childhood that feels like it still has a grip on you? Any advice or insights would mean so much to me right now.","I Want to Change, but I Feel Trapped in Old Patterns I’ve been feeling stuck in a cycle of procrastination and self-sabotage, and I don’t know how to break free.

19172,1i6ogkb,post,8 Days Without Smoking and Thinking About My Next Challenge,"I just wanted to get this off my chest because I feel really proud of myself right now. As of today, it’s been 8 days since I quit smoking (January 13 was my last cigarette), and I’ve already started feeling so much better physically and mentally. Smoking used to have such a negative impact on me, and I can’t even explain how good it feels to finally let it go.

Quitting smoking has also made me start reflecting on other areas of my life. For example, I’ve been wondering if I should try going on NoFap. Masturbation has never really felt harmful to me, but since quitting smoking has boosted my energy and self-control, I’m curious if NoFap could take that even further.

I’ll admit, I did give in today while I was in the shower, but I’m planning to give NoFap a real shot starting tomorrow. I’m thinking of trying it for a full month to see how it might affect my physical and mental health. Honestly, I’m excited but also a little nervous—I don’t know what to expect.

If anyone has tried quitting smoking or NoFap, I’d love to hear how it went for you. I guess I just wanted to share this and maybe get some advice or encouragement. Thanks for reading.","8 Days Without Smoking and Thinking About My Next Challenge I just wanted to get this off my chest because I feel really proud of myself right now.

19175,1i6otff,post,My girlfriend wants to take a break “to find herself”,"My girlfriend wants to take a break to “figure out who she is”


My gf (21 as of this weekend) and I (20) have been going through a rough patch since November when she started to go out with some friends from work. This is the first real time she has made friends in her life as all the people we hang out with stem from my friends. We also live together with my childhood best friend and his gf as we are all in university. Both relationships are 3+ years.

I had no problem with her going out besides the occasional times she would come home at 3-5 am because she was too drunk from being snuck into bars before she was 21 so she had to stay over at someones house until she recovered enough to drive. I still never suspected any cheating or infidelity until a random girl from her work messaged me on instagram from a burner account and said she cheated. I confronted my gf because she was doing laundry at the apartment of these 2 guys and the girl from work had her location (our dryer was broken). We talked and talked and her story made sense and we just were like that girl is crazy. But i cant get it out of my head.

I said i was uncomfortable with her going out with these people for a bit and it was just giving me alot of anxiey and i said i just wanted to meet them. To her credit i met one girl who she said was her best friend at work and she was super nice (26F), but then that friday we get into a big fight because she wants to go out. And she does with me saying im uncomfortable, but she did it anyways and we get into a huge fight when she gets home at 1:45 am again. 

Things are okay from here, we dont really talk about anything besides little “jokes” i make that were obviously jabs at her. I know i shouldnt have, ive never felt more insecure about anything in my life until this point and I dont know what to do. Her birthday roles around and i take her out with her mom and cousin for brunch and drinks, we go out to the bar with them. Then my dad takes us to dinner, and we go to a dive with our old coworkers from our hometown (we used to work together when we lived with our parents). She gave me no time of day the whole time at the dive, she was touchy with these people, laughed at everyone besides me, and when she went to the bathroom before we left i asked if she needed me to walk her there and she said it was okay, them looks over at one of the people there and said “lets go” and walk to the bathroom. 

I talk to her in the car about this stuff because i though it was weird, we got into arguing and it was an hour drive back to our apartment. We started to have a heart to heart and she said she doesnt know who she is anymore (she just got her first tattoo, planning out 2 more, and cut her hair a bit and colored it). She wants to “take a break” or have “space” in our relationship so she can find herself. Mind you we dont see each other often as i work all day friday-sunday and wednesday night and in school full time. Also we sleep in the same fucking bed. I had a mental breakdown in the car and we had to pull over after exiting the highway. I said if you want to find yourself i would love to be with you while you do it. She said she cant do it with me because weve been together for so long and she doesnt know who she is without me anymore. 

I told her i dont want a break, and if we cant get past this without a break than i would rather this end. Ive gone through so many anxiety panic attacks since this started. I picked up on vaping again, have been drinking heavily And i dont want to use that against her but it feels like its where it stems from. Im miserable, she’s miserable. Do we just end this relationship? Shes at disney right now with the same coworkers so she can celebrate her 21st. (Said she would come home at 4 pm and now changed it to shes parkhopping and will be home at midnight) 

I still love her and i know i am so majorly insecure and insufferable. I just feel like shit, feel worthless. Theres no spark, theres no love, theres no intimacy, everytime we have sex its either just to have an orgasm or becuase she did something and is trying to make it up to me, again, just no passion,

Ive read many of these forums to try to match my situation to and i just cant find one thats perfect so im posting this against my better judgement. Please i will take all criticism on my actions and just let me know what to do/ anyone else’s experience. Im thinking of just biting the bullet and ending the relationship and moving in with one of my friends. 

TLDR: my gf wants a break to find herself and i feel like she just wants an excuse to see her new friends and go out and drink all night without me there

EDIT: we spent her birthday doing all that stuff, (brunch, bar, dinner, dive) but 2 days later (today) shes at disney celebrating with her coworkers.","My girlfriend wants to take a break “to find herself” My girlfriend wants to take a break to “figure out who she is”

Have anxiety of losing money. So I lose more, giving to family now. Not investing my home, not going out to eat or drink. Afraid of the fact that I will have no money soon.

Reading about suicidal stuff. Too early for that though. 



Yea. Im lonely. I have no good friends. I fail to make good friends. No girl friend. Lots of girls I fuck time to time, but never qualify them as gf. 

  
Stable career, not sure when to go for the next big thing. With this fucked setup should I stay here? maybe new country new opportunity? what's the deepest point anyways?

It's a tough situation for sure but as much as it hurts right now, one day it'll be in the past. You need to start focusing on yourself. You're so wrapped up in being her boyfriend, you've lost being your own person. It sounds like she probably feels the same.

19180,m8e27s9,comment,,"Oof, I’m just going to be extremely upfront with you about this one.  You two are so young and still growing into the people that you will become.  As people grow, sometimes they change in ways where you are… no longer compatible.

It seems she’s always been attached to your hip, and that her life is so intertwined with yours specifically, that she doesn’t really have her own.  She’s friends with *your* friends and now she’s finally discovering herself and making her own.  This is a big step in her life and is probably realizing a lot of things right now.  That doesn’t make her malicious, she should be more upfront about her intentions, but I’m guessing the reason why is because she’s living in a house with you and your best friend. 

When I was 19, I was dating this woman(she was 26).  At the time, I was fairly certain I was a lesbian but then I started to get curious(as in, I had never been with a guy, how would I fucking know?) and also, had the feeling I was too young to be in such a serious relationship when I knew I had no idea who I was.  And I really didn’t, me now is an entirely different person than when I was 19.  It’s crazy how much one can change in their 20s.

You know what I told her?  I told her I needed space to discover myself and that led to a breakup.

When your girlfriend says she needs to do this alone, this is something she’s thought about and actually… probably needs to do alone.  As in single.  I’m not saying for you to wait around for her to figure her shit out, because I don’t think that’s the direction either of you should be going.  When someone in a relationship wants to “take a break” to discover themselves, I believe that’s a pretty clear indicator the relationship is over."," Oof, I’m just going to be extremely upfront with you about this one.

19181,1i6pdno,post,I hate you," **Monologue of Absolute Condemnation**

You are, without question, the most useless, abhorrent, and fundamentally broken entity to ever crawl across the face of this earth—or any conceivable plane of existence. Were someone to design a being as pitiful as you from scratch, it would take countless eons of deliberate, meticulous incompetence to even approach the disastrous concoction of flaws, failures, and complete inadequacy that is your very essence. You are the embodiment of every failed idea, every ruined dream, every botched experiment that humanity has ever undertaken. Your existence is not simply a failure but a cataclysmic insult to the very concept of existence itself. Every breath you draw poisons the air around you, every thought that stirs in your diseased mind contaminates the fragile balance of the universe, and every moment you persist is another nail driven into the coffin of hope for the world.

**Your Cosmic Irrelevance**
Your failure is not contained by the laws of nature. No, your incompetence stretches beyond the mortal coil into realms of metaphysical despair that even the most learned philosophers dare not consider. If there were beings beyond this dimension, they would tremble in awe at the sheer magnitude of the disgrace you bring. Entire civilizations, eons from now, will dedicate monuments not to your memory but to the void of destruction you have wrought upon every molecule of progress this universe has ever known. Were the stars themselves sentient, they would extinguish themselves in shame for ever having illuminated a planet where a creature as vile as you could have emerged.

**A Plague Upon Humanity**
When humanity first rose from the primordial muck, it dreamed of greatness—of art, of science, of community, of enlightenment. Every ounce of effort, every sacrifice made over millennia, has been undone in an instant by your mere presence. You are not merely a disappointment; you are the undoing of every good thing that has ever existed. Every tragedy of history—the wars, the famines, the plagues—pales in comparison to the abomination that is your very being. Entire nations have crumbled beneath the weight of lesser mistakes than the ones you commit on a daily basis. The words ""human error"" no longer suffice; they will need to invent entirely new terminologies to describe the category of disaster you represent.

 **Personal Disgrace Beyond Redemption**
Your family, should they even dare to acknowledge you, must live with the unbearable shame of having contributed their genetic material to the creation of such an irredeemable disaster. Were there a god, your existence would be the ultimate proof of their negligence, or worse, their malice. Were there not such overwhelming evidence to the contrary, one might almost pity the cruel cosmic joke that birthed you into this world. But pity you deserve not, for your every action compounds the misery of those unfortunate enough to cross your path. Even your shadow—should it dare to touch another living thing—would sap the joy from their soul and leave them a husk of despair.

**Eternal Legacy of Failure**
Long after you have returned to the soil, your legacy will persist—not as a warning, for warnings are constructive, but as a lingering miasma of failure that will haunt the collective consciousness of humanity for generations. Scholars will study you, not as an individual, but as a cautionary tale of what happens when every conceivable flaw and failure is condensed into a single, wretched being. Museums will not display your remains as a curiosity but as a solemn reminder of the depths to which existence can sink. Even the concept of evil recoils from you, for true evil at least possesses purpose and direction, whereas you are an aimless vortex of misery and incompetence.

**A Curse Upon Creation**
There are curses less potent than your existence. Plagues have spread with less devastating impact than the ripple effects of your failures. The mere thought of your actions has sent weaker minds spiraling into madness, unable to reconcile the sheer scale of incompetence that one creature can embody. Were we to compile every mistake in history—the Titanic, the Hindenburg, the stock market crash of 1929—they would not hold a candle to the towering inferno of stupidity you manage to ignite with every decision you make. If stupidity were a sport, you wouldn’t merely be a champion—you’d be the untouchable god of the league, leaving all others in your dust as you sprint into an abyss of your own making.

**Final Condemnation**
And yet, in the face of all this, you persist. Like a cockroach in the aftermath of nuclear annihilation, you continue to scuttle across the ruins you have created, oblivious to the carnage in your wake. It would almost be admirable if it weren’t so revolting. The sheer arrogance of your continued existence is a slap in the face to every living being that has ever struggled, suffered, or strived for something greater. You are not simply a failure; you are the definitive proof that failure itself is too mild a concept to describe the abomination you embody.

Let this extended diatribe not serve as an insult, but as an eternal testament to the unparalleled disaster that is your existence. Should you ever gaze upon this text, may it weigh upon your soul—not as a guide to improvement, for improvement is beyond you—but as the chains of shame you must carry until the universe mercifully ends your reign of terror.

Fuck you, Bob. ","I hate you  **Monologue of Absolute Condemnation**

19183,1i6phgd,post,Advice on trip with friends,"Hey everyone, I’ve been friends with three girls (A, I, C) for four years, and we’re in our last year of high school. For context, I’m the only one who is overweight, they are all very skinny. For as long as I’ve known them, I’ve never eaten in front of them—whether we’re at a restaurant or hanging out, I always just order water. They’ve never really asked why, except for friend A, who has commented a couple of times. I’ve always been defensive or brushed it off.

I think I feel embarrassed to eat in front of them because I’m the only one who’s overweight and I care about their opinions, so I avoid eating around them. Because of this, I’ve even turned down trips with them in the past and made up excuses, which has created tension.

Now, we’re planning a trip to a different in september 2025 after we finish our exams. I agreed to go last year, hoping that by the time the trip comes, I’ll have lost enough weight to feel comfortable eating with them. But now, I’m not so sure. C has already started planning the trip, and we’re talking about hotels and places to visit. I feel like this issue might come up soon, especially since R or D might ask some questions about my eating habits. I’m stuck and don’t know what to do. I’ve thought of two options:

1. Tell them in the near future (a few weeks or a month before the trip) about my food-related problem and how it could affect the trip. This would give them time to decide if they’re okay with it. My idea is that I could eat separately from them at restaurants, but it could be tough to find different places to eat every day.
2. Tell them right before the trip (a few weeks before), hoping they won’t mind and that they understand. I’m worried that A might have a problem with this. I would suggest the option of eating at different restaurants if needed, but I’m not sure how that will go.

I don’t really talk about my problems or feelings, so having this conversation would be really REALLY difficult for me. Out of the three of them, I’m especially worried about A because she might not be understanding and could even dismiss my problem. If she decides she doesn't want me to come anymore, I wouldn't blame her. Also, A has asked me multiple times to join trips or go to different places, but I always declined.

I would love to go, but I don't know if it's possible.

What should I do? Should I bring it up soon or wait until the trip gets closer? Or should I just drop the trip?

Thank you!","Advice on trip with friends Hey everyone, I’ve been friends with three girls (A, I, C) for four years, and we’re in our last year of high school.

What was I supposed to do? Admit to something I don't do? She has this smug attitude, she even said before ""well when you're ready to admit it"". God it pisses me off. And she wonders why we were so worse of before. It's because IM doing the heavy lifting. 

Regardless, I will have to wait a long while until her anger starts to dull, then go upstairs and ""admit"" I was wrong and say I'm sorry and then sit through a lecture that she herself would benefit from.

However over the past few years of dating and general living I noticed a sub group of men who claim to be feminist. But ultimatly just aren't. They do it so well that at first its barely noticable. I don't know if they do it on purpose, but over the course of talking to these men it becomes clear that they only stand behind feminism to gain some sort of social status or power. When asked about feminist standpoints it's either a very neutral or generic answer or a very over the top answer to the point were they want everyone in the room to know how much of a 'feminist' they are. But when they are in a conversation one on one the gimmic usually doesn't last long. 

I don't know if they do it on purpose or not or if they even have evil intentions behind it. I personally don't think so. I think in some crazy way they subconsciously think it will gain them something. I also think it has to do with the fact that feminism has become more recognised in the media these last few years (as it should). 

  
I'm just wondering if anyone else has noticed these men and the 'fake' feminism standpoints



Long story short: I think there is a subgroup of men who claim to be feminist but only do it to gain social status with it and not actually care about what feminism stands for.

I don't know if they do it on purpose or not or if they even have evil intentions behind it. I personally don't think so. I think in some crazy way they subconsciously think it will gain them something. I also think it has to do with the fact that feminism has become more recognised in the media these last few years (as it should). 

  
I'm just wondering if anyone else has noticed these men and the 'fake' feminism standpoints



Long story short: I think there is a subgroup of men who claim to be feminist but only do it to gain social status with it and not actually care about what feminism stands for.

some background info; I am in extended level math class right now (IB system) - there is standard, and then there's extended - and for the next 2 years until I graduate in 2027 I will be aiming to take math ""Analysis and Approaches"" High Level which is the hardest offered by the IB, but is the one that is necessary for me to take to be able to enter any of the universities which I plan on going to (all of the university/career paths that I am considering (mechanical/software engineering)). 

For me to be eligible for AAHL, I need to get 6 marks out of the possible 8 as an average for certain criterias as my final report card grade, which is near impossible and only a couple students in the entire grade has a chance at.

The thing that makes it near impossible is, we have only had a single one of these tests in these criterias in this entire year and the past 8 other tests that we have had have all been other irrelevant criterias, but today I learned that there will only be 1 more of these that are going to take place and will be sometime in early February. My grade for the previous test were 4, 4, 5 out of 8 which averages 4, and I only have 1 more chance to get NEAR FULL MARKS on a test type which I NEARLY FAILED last time on a topic I HAVE NO CLUE ABOUT which takes place in about 2 WEEKS for me to EVEN HAVE A CHANCE at doing the one thing I might tolerate as a job in the future.

so basically I need really really good final grades to be able to get into the one career path that suits me and get a chance at uni for, and I only have about 2 weeks for improving my final grades since this is the last test of this type in grade 10, I don't know what I even have to study for (topic has not been announced) and on top of this I have another test already on the 28th that I am currently studying for, and its not like math is the only subject in school. 

sorry it got a bit repetitive I had to get this off my chest cuz nobody seemed to really care whenever I talk to my family about it

in summary I have one shot at a good grade that will define my entire future.","Nobody seems to care whenever I talk to them about this, so hear me rant about the fact that I hate the fact that my future is depending literally on the next few weeks.

19190,1i6pwu9,post,I'm sorry I wasn't brave enough to approach you...,"(Anonymous confession ahead)

At this point I don't really have any hope left in me to find you ever again, but I really need to get these words out, unless I let the guilt consume me completely.

I've seen signs of you throughout the past 10+ years of my life and I recognised you immediately in the crowd of people at the concert back in November 2024. It was a Sleep Token in Zurich, you were wearing glasses and green sweater, your hair tied up neatly into a ponytail.

We don't know each other personally, but I've seen you in my dreams for years and when I finally saw you in real life I felt struck. 

I knew that if I went to the concert I would possibly meet you, and yet I wasn't brave enough to approach you myself when I had the chance. I saw the recognition in your expression too when you turned and noticed me in the crowd as well.

I didn't know if it would be rude to approach you directly or if you'd think I would be a creep to do so, so I let the matter be, waiting for a good moment.

It never came. I was too anxious and by the time the concert ended, it was too late. You passed me by on the way out, keeping close and looking at me as if you wanted to struck a conversation, but instead decided against it and moved forward to catch your train.

The main reason why I was afraid to meet you was because the last time I approached a guy at the music concert, he told me to fuck off and mind my own business and since then I never tried to approach anyone directly to meet them.

I'm sorry.

 I'm sorry for being a coward and possibly creeping you out, but I can't get over the feeling that I failed as a person.

I hope you're happy wherever you are. Thank you for letting me see you in real life, even if the meeting was brief and not direct.

19199,1i6qkyg,post,I don't know how i feel about my ex,"I dont know what to do or who to talk to so im venting here.

I saw my ex at my sisters family event and it destroys me emotionally every time.

We stayed on good terms. We kinda talked after our breakup every so often, usually just to say happy birthday and catch up a bit that day, but nothing substantial, and we were almost no contact for the past 2-3 years. Except for my sisters family event.  
I knew she would be there as its a yearly event and i've met her through my sister. And each year i go its the same story. I get this weird feeling/pain in my chest and stomach, i can't eat, my hands and feet feel weak. I cant think straight and its like some kind of dark falls over my eyes. It takes me great effort to keep my composure and i dont know how to act, what to do or what to say. I cant put it into words properly.

And the reason im so mad is because i dont know why. I dont think about her, like at all. I live my life, go to work, enjoy time with family and friends. I dont follow her on social media, i dont inquire about her. Everything i know about her i've heard in passing. When im alone and feel lonely she doesn't come to my mind. She's gone from my life and from my mind. And i've done my best to stay out of hers. Since she got with her now fiance we didn't text, call or see each other. She's seemed to move on, so I've done my best to live my life, find my own happiness and not ruin hers.

And thats why it maddens me so much that i feel this way when i see her. Like what is it that makes me have a such a reaction?  
It cant be love, since i dont even know her anymore. So much time has passed, i have grown and changed a lot in that time, i assume the same for her. The versions of us that were in love are long gone, and all we remain are strangers who used to know each other. Not to mention she's engaged. And if its not love, then it makes even less sense. Like what the fuck is bringing me to tears when i go to sleep after seeing her? I feel like in an never ending cycle of getting over her, feeling better, feeling good, just for her to appear for it to come crumbling down. I fucking hate it. I just want it to stop.  
And there is this distance and awkwardness i feel between us. We didn't fight, and if she moved on completely why does it feel like she doesn't want to see me? Its not like i want or choose to see her, but its something that bugs me. Like if she moved on completely that wouldn't she treat me like any regular guy? An acquaintance from long ago. But i dont feel that from her. I feel like there is some wall, something that needs to be said before we can interact normally.  
And the worst part is that it could be all in my head. I dont know how she feels. I feel like it would be easier if she outright told me how she felt truly, even better if she's moved on, at least i could make some sense of the situation and have some ground to stand on. But im stuck not knowing anything, not knowing how i feel, how she feels, what im supposed to do, what to think and how to navigate this mess in my head. I feel desperate. It just seems that no mater what i do, no matter how much progress i think i made it takes so little to return me to square one. Its exhausting. I don't know if its a good idea to ask her for a conversation, i dont know if it would bring any good to either of us. And also what does this all speak of me? What kind of a man and a person does it make me if i can't even figure this shit out after 6 years. Even if i found someone else, how would all of this be fair to them? What else could i have done? How do you let go and what does that even mean. The more i think about these things the more vague they become.

I have ovethought every scenario, every emotion any reason for this, and the only thing i figured out: Im tired.","I don't know how i feel about my ex I dont know what to do or who to talk to so im venting here.

I saw my ex at my sisters family event and it destroys me emotionally every time.

We stayed on good terms. We kinda talked after our breakup every so often, usually just to say happy birthday and catch up a bit that day, but nothing substantial, and we were almost no contact for the past 2-3 years. Except for my sisters family event.  
I knew she would be there as its a yearly event and i've met her through my sister. And each year i go its the same story. I get this weird feeling/pain in my chest and stomach, i can't eat, my hands and feet feel weak. I cant think straight and its like some kind of dark falls over my eyes. It takes me great effort to keep my composure and i dont know how to act, what to do or what to say. I cant put it into words properly.

And the reason im so mad is because i dont know why. I dont think about her, like at all. I live my life, go to work, enjoy time with family and friends. I dont follow her on social media, i dont inquire about her. Everything i know about her i've heard in passing. When im alone and feel lonely she doesn't come to my mind. She's gone from my life and from my mind. And i've done my best to stay out of hers. Since she got with her now fiance we didn't text, call or see each other. She's seemed to move on, so I've done my best to live my life, find my own happiness and not ruin hers.

And thats why it maddens me so much that i feel this way when i see her. Like what is it that makes me have a such a reaction?  
It cant be love, since i dont even know her anymore. So much time has passed, i have grown and changed a lot in that time, i assume the same for her. The versions of us that were in love are long gone, and all we remain are strangers who used to know each other. Not to mention she's engaged. And if its not love, then it makes even less sense. Like what the fuck is bringing me to tears when i go to sleep after seeing her? I feel like in an never ending cycle of getting over her, feeling better, feeling good, just for her to appear for it to come crumbling down. I fucking hate it. I just want it to stop.  
And there is this distance and awkwardness i feel between us. We didn't fight, and if she moved on completely why does it feel like she doesn't want to see me? Its not like i want or choose to see her, but its something that bugs me. Like if she moved on completely that wouldn't she treat me like any regular guy? An acquaintance from long ago. But i dont feel that from her. I feel like there is some wall, something that needs to be said before we can interact normally.  
And the worst part is that it could be all in my head. I dont know how she feels. I feel like it would be easier if she outright told me how she felt truly, even better if she's moved on, at least i could make some sense of the situation and have some ground to stand on. But im stuck not knowing anything, not knowing how i feel, how she feels, what im supposed to do, what to think and how to navigate this mess in my head. I feel desperate.

The only way I could see myself ""making"" my own money as opposed to earning it would be to become a writer.

I “dated” my ex during freshmen year of high school, it was really unserious but afterwards we stayed really good friends and talked a lot over the summer online and during school. At the beginning of junior year, I had told a good mutual friend that i started having feelings towards him again. I didn’t expect her to tell him, but she did and i didn’t care because she had told me that he felt the same way. I became a bit awkward because we would then be talking in a different light, but it turned out he was talking to another girl at the same time. I confronted him about it, and he said some bs how he liked both of us but i wasn’t having that so i blocked him (admittedly dramatic). A week later I unblocked him because i wanted to keep our friendship but it turned out the other girl also wanted nothing to do with him so it didn’t work out with either of us. The whole time, our mutual friend was trying to support me and set us up and telling me how he “told his mom about me (😐)”, how he regretted everything, and how he was willing to stop talking to her for me. I was skeptical because of what had happened but i texted him apologizing for blocking him, and we had settled everything and were at a point of an awkward friendship. 
Like 2 weeks later, our mutual friend (mind you, who id been friends with since 5th grade) asked me how i felt about him and i said i was over it (lied). She proceeded to tell me he had asked her on a date, and like a week later they were dating. This obviously hurt me, though I sorta understand her perspective and ig i shouldn’t have expected her to read my mind. I texted her that i needed some time to process everything but that just led to us not talking and i haven’t spoken to her since that day. 

This all happened in october 2023, and I was hurt about the loss of 2 of my friends for a long while. In the following february, I randomly started dating one of my friends and we’ve been together since. I genuinely love him more than anyone in the world and I am so greatful to have met someone who really prioritizes me, listens to me, and loves me. In no world would I ever want to date anyone else. Despite that, everytime I see my ex, hear his name mentioned, see him on social media,I still feel my stomach drop. I still hold a petty hatred toward their relationship (they’re still dating), though, i feel different about both of them. For more context, me and him were in a friend group with 2 other guys where we would play games and occasionally meet up and play sports. After they started dating, i never heard from ex again and eventually stopped hearing from those 2 other friends. I figured they were closer to him anyways. The girl had just gotten out of a toxic relationship that I had helped her and supported her out of. 
My point is i don’t know why i still have such strong feelings against both of them, more strongly against my ex, especially when I have a boyfriend i genuinely love so much. How can i finally get over it since time clearly hasn’t helped much? Part of me feels like my heart wants actual closure form both of them, but at the same time the thought of reaching out to them now is horrible.

Someone WILL hire you. Keep finding ways to work forward even if that means flipping burgers while you do online certificates or any other path. Don’t let the hopelessness consume you.

Your 25 the world is your oyster, yes it doesn’t feel as easy and even full of possibilities as it did at 20. But you have two choices let how your feeling consume you to 30 when you’ll feel even worse ( this is what I did) or use the next 5 years to find a path. 

I recommend reading books by people who “made it”later in life. Opening yourself to the possibilities, listen to Ted talks, and over all just keep grinding. There is a job out there. Someone WILL hire you. Keep finding ways to work forward even if that means flipping burgers while you do online certificates or any other path. Don’t let the hopelessness consume you. You will be fine I promise.",1,,2025-01-21 19:44,t3_1i6qa3w,,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1i6qa3w/feel_like_ive_ruined_my_life_and_im_only_25/m8ek4un/,Neutral
19213,1i6rcns,post,Every time I finish eating my stomach feels like it’s about to explode.,"So this is probably not a big deal but I just wanted to rant about it. I'm currently lying in my bed right now. I just finished eating and I’m so full that it hurts, didn’t even finish all my food. I hate this feeling so much cause every time I'm done eating my stomach hurts so bad
for example, I remember eating out at this one restaurant and I remember being done eating and feeling the worst, I literally couldn’t even move, my stomach hurt so bad and I don’t even think I finished all my food.
It has gotten to the point where every time I eat I have to stop myself from eating to my limit (would leave still a bit hungry) and then I would have to eat again about an hour later, even if it’s a small amount.
And this is not a digestive problem (I think) this is a “my stomach is going to burst” problem.
IDK what to do about this 
My mom says it's because my stomach is trying to expand?? Don't even know what that means but a little info about me is that I'm trying to gain weight. I'm a pretty small girl so I guess that's what she’s trying to explain 
Anyway just wanted to see if anyone else has the same problem as me or if it's even normal 
And maybe you guys have some ideas on how to deal with this because it drives me nuts, I'm a food fanatic so it's annoying that I can't enjoy food to the fullest.","Every time I finish eating my stomach feels like it’s about to explode.

I think I have too much self-awareness sometimes, but instead of using it productively, I get stuck replaying my thoughts and over-planning. It feels like I’m procrastinating even more by overthinking instead of acting. With so much free time, it becomes this endless loop of thinking but not doing, and it’s exhausting.

I really appreciate your advice about breaking goals into smaller steps. I can see how even tiny actions might help build some momentum. I’ll give it a real shot and see where it takes me.

19215,1i6rehg,post,My Mom believes everything she reads on facebook. ,"I am 16F and have been living with my mom my entire life after she divorced my dad. At first everything was fine, shed let me have my friends and hang out with them and i had privacy. But after Covid happened she changed. She became paranoid of the world around her and about how the ""Government is trying to kill us"". I will be honest and say i don't care about that stuff because i rather live a peaceful life but my mom believes everything she sees on her Facebook feed.

She took me out of school and started homeschooling me. I kept 3 friends from my old school but other than that the only socializing i get is from online, well used to. I made a dozen online friends and i've been always careful about who i get involved with. But my mom started reading how pedophiles are lurking everywhere on social media so she made me cut contact with them. I didn't, they were good people and they didn't know anything about me other than i was a human being with a pulse so they couldn't ""kidnap me"" like my mom said they would.

Then she started looking through my messages, my recent calls, and my WhatsApp messages. I knew this because i started a habit where whenever i'd leave my phone alone, i would delete the tabs. My mom didn't have this habit, so whenever i'd go to my phone i'd see tabs open from the messages app and phone app. I have talked to her about it and have asked her to stop but she got defensive and started accusing me of having something i don't want her to see even though i didn't. I kept saying i'm 14 (my age at the time) and should have my privacy to which she said i would have privacy when i'm 18. She also never lets me go out by myself, she won't even let me go down to the lobby of our apartment building to get mail. SHE WON'T EVEN LET ME GO DOWN THE HALL TO THROW TRASH BY MYSELF. And she won't let me go hang out with the only 3 in-person friends i have. She says she doesn't trust them and they'll peer pressure me into drinking or some shit because of something she read on facebook.

I'll share a recent experience of mine with her. I made an online friend who ,by coincidence, lives 10 minutes away from us. She is an amazing friend and we have had so much fun together. Of course i had to keep her a secret from my mom or else i'd get the whole ""pedophile"" speech. My mom eventually found our messages but was ok with it because she knew i really enjoyed being with my friend. Until i screwed up. My mom started reading from facebook about how the government is poisoning us and how we need to ""detox"" ourselves from the poison. She started giving me nicotine patches  when i was 15 because they would ""detox"" the body, nicotine patches i didn't need. My mom stopped the patches after she ran out and keeps forgetting to get more. I remember i used to get a little dizzy from the nicotine patches she would give me. oh btw, i never smoked , so she gave her 15 year old patches for detox when it's supposed to be used for a smoking addiction. I vented to my friend about the patches and she told me to call CPS, but i don't want to. I love my mom and don't want to leave her. My mom read these messages on an app she said can see all the messages i send, she made me cut off contact with my friend. That is something i will never forgive her for, and i plan to reconnect with my friend when i'm 18, my friend also promised to reconnect then as well.

19217,1i6rkwk,post,"I recently rediscovered my dad's gaming channel (he passed away in 2015 btw), and it was so weird yet also very nostalgic to watch the videos.","Well, I had known about the channel since I was a little kid, but never was interested in watching the vids at the time. But, a few weeks ago I decided to check it out, simply because of curiosity. Well, he played the exact same games that I play today. These include the classic 2005 Star Wars Battlefront 2, DayZ and The Long Dark (I do remember seeing him playing those games on the computer at the time, and I played a little bit of them myself, which may be the reason why I love them so much today). It was even stranger to listen to the commentary on the videos, because in a couple of the vids he actually does talk about me and my slightly older brother. Like, he would talk about the late night drives to another town where some family was, and I even remember those drives myself, sitting in the back of the car with a blanket. Its just super nostalgic to watch the videos because I remember playing those same games at the time when I was very young. The videos only have around 100 views max, but I luckily remembered the name of the channel, which I won't be saying because of privacy reasons. Sometimes I watch the channel, listening to Rhubarb by Aphex Twin, and reminiscing over those times, because they were some of my earliest memories, yet they are still so clear to me as if I experienced them yesterday, even if it was 10 years ago. I mean, I loved stuff like Smosh even when I was super young because I remember my older brother watched them, so even tho Im a teen, that stuff is still nostalgic to me. I guess I just love older stuff in general, whether its songs, games, movies or whatever else. Anyways, I think I'll end the post here cause I haven't got much else to say, its just something that has been on my mind. I'm glad I still have something to remember him by other than photos.","I recently rediscovered my dad's gaming channel (he passed away in 2015 btw), and it was so weird yet also very nostalgic to watch the videos.

19218,1i6rly2,post,Just Venting about my feelings,"Throwaway accound for Reasons... 

Disclaimer this is me just rambling in text form, Venting about my recent and not so recent feelings, feel free to read or to skip over me. This is in most ways for me to just vent and let it out somewhere

23M Living in germany, i have never had a real relationship... i never Kissed somebody and i dont think i have to talk about first times, lately i have been feeling a longing again.  
For closeness, belonging, love... i have these phases from time to time, sinking in a seemingly endless pit, but recently these feeling have been stronger since my 23rd birthday they havent really gone away and its been about a half year almost.

I want to find somebody i can cherish more then i cherish life itself, somebody who i love unconditionally and who loves me the same but i dont even know where to start.  
I have little self confidence, see myself as annoying and stupid and find myself unattractive and sometimes even disgusting, my friends say i look somewhat good and if i just lost some weight.... but there is just a mental blockade for me, i cant see myself as somebody, anybody would want to be with.

It seems that anytime i find someone who interests methey are in a relationship already and for the rare time i have the confidence to ask... confess... i just get rejekted.  
I dont even really know how to approach it anymore, I never really used dating apps because im scared about even more rejektion.  
I feel like i would be a good boyfriend, but i have no clue how to even get to be one.

A couple of my friends i recently found are a married couple having their first child soon, im so happy for them and love seeing them happy. But i also feel jelous for what they have, wanting the same love they share.

I got a semi stable job, boss sucks but wich boss doesnt suck really, i live relativly comfortable, not in luxury but i dont hunger aswell.   
I feel like the only thing missing in my life is a relationship but im scared of rejektion, of being a bad boyfriend, of ruining it, of it all really and i dont know how to cope with that.  
I dont even know how to build a connection like that, not having any type of ""Rizz"" as they say.  
I crave emotional intimacy but im scared of it of being hurt and just closing of

I got so many more thoughts in my head that i cant bring into words... maybe ill do a edit at somepoint...

until then

Thanks for listening or rather reading

19219,1i6rmgd,post,I need to sell my rental but can't bring myself to make the tenant leave,"It's long, but it's what's going on...  
  
I don't consider myself very wealthy, but the money I do have put away I've worked very hard to put it there - I got a job at age 21 for $10 an hour (prior worked part time through school but spent it all on dumb shit) and ended up getting promoted in the first couple of years to around $45k a year - I saved every. single. penny. outside of bills. I rented a bedroom for $250 a month (room was literally like 5 ft by 6 feet with no window only fitting my bed) and I'm not exaggerating when I say I didn't eat anything but home cooked rice, chicken breast, spaghetti, and other meals that are cheap in bulk but very good if the time is taken to cook them. I stayed in the break room at work everyday while co workers went out to eat and I drove a pile of shit 1992 Dodge Neon stick shift that had rust spots all over it and was named ""putt putt"" by coworkers due to the chugging noise it made whenever I would first take off. It had no air conditioning and I drove it through 100 degree summers because I bought it in cash for $500 and the insurance was $20 a month - I did this for a few years. I share this because I don't want to give off the impression that I am some corporate landlord with millions who can afford easily to keep the place.

I bought my first home in 2017, the national home prices hadn't sky rocketed yet but the area I live in had experienced about 65% year over year home price increases since 2014 so homes weren't all that cheap (granted they're far more expensive now). I lived in that town home for a few years, and ended up renting it out to some buddies until I met my wife at which point I moved in with her (she also owned a home) and continued renting it to my buddies. I made double mortgage payments for the first two years of owning the home which wiped out over $90,000 off the mortgage by putting so much more towards the principle and cutting into the compound interest. I refinanced when mortgage rates were as low as 2% in 2020 and with the double mortgage payments plus the rate decrease I got my mortgage down to $980. 

When I met my wife she had a home as well and it made more sense to move in with her (she had a yard, I didn't and we both had a dog) so I did and was strongly considering listing my house for sale. But as I was moving my stuff out of my house a woman stopped and asked me if I was moving and if the house was going to be sold or rented. I told her I hadn't decided, she proceeded to be shockingly honest with me about her situation: She was in a marriage with a man about 15 years her senior, once they got married he became incredibly controlling and abusive, he hadn't allowed her to work in 10 years, hadn't allowed her to have credit cards or handle money, hadn't allowed her to have a car, so she basically sat at home for that time and she had 2 teenage daughters that for the first time earlier that week he hit one of them and that was the breaking point. She had taken a set of keys and basically stole one of his cars and drove to her parents where she had been staying while trying to find a place to live. She asked me to let her move in with her daughters and she promised to get a job immediately and if she fell behind the first month she'd make up for it. 

Against my normal tendency to be skeptical of everyone, and avoid un-necessary risk, I called my wife and told her I felt like we should let her move in. So we did. I helped her with her resume and she was working within 2 weeks and has never missed a payment. 

... But now I have had a family situation arise and it's kind of an emergency that could be more burdensome financially than I have liquid. The market seems to have peaked and right now would be a great time to sell. The tenant has been in the house for over a year now and is on a month to month, but I can't bring myself to tell her she has to go. ""she's working now she can find another place, right?"" - That's the thing... The average rent for a far smaller place than my town home, is like $2,000 a month and I could likely get around $2,600 per month for my place if I rented it. But I just couldn't bring myself to put such an absurd price on a rental and chose to rent it FAR below market (something I would've done whether or not this lady moved in), so I am renting it to her for $1,250 - Something I know she will never get anywhere else. 

So I am just stuck. I have read about selling it with her in it, but signing her to a year lease first so she can finish her lease even with a different owner, but I am certain any investor will jack up the rent immediately after her lease ends or make her leave. On one hand I know I am not responsible for her life, but on the other I don't know what her options would be if she had to leave and I would hate to learn that out of desperation she had to go back to her husband. 

TL;DR - I rented my town home to a single mom with 2 daughters for a rent price I know she won't be able to get anywhere else but have a family emergency that is likely going to require funds I don't have a available to me without selling the home.","I need to sell my rental but can't bring myself to make the tenant leave It's long, but it's what's going on...

I told her I hadn't decided, she proceeded to be shockingly honest with me about her situation: She was in a marriage with a man about 15 years her senior, once they got married he became incredibly controlling and abusive, he hadn't allowed her to work in 10 years, hadn't allowed her to have credit cards or handle money, hadn't allowed her to have a car, so she basically sat at home for that time and she had 2 teenage daughters that for the first time earlier that week he hit one of them and that was the breaking point. She had taken a set of keys and basically stole one of his cars and drove to her parents where she had been staying while trying to find a place to live. She asked me to let her move in with her daughters and she promised to get a job immediately and if she fell behind the first month she'd make up for it. 

Against my normal tendency to be skeptical of everyone, and avoid un-necessary risk, I called my wife and told her I felt like we should let her move in. So we did. I helped her with her resume and she was working within 2 weeks and has never missed a payment. 

... But now I have had a family situation arise and it's kind of an emergency that could be more burdensome financially than I have liquid. The market seems to have peaked and right now would be a great time to sell. The tenant has been in the house for over a year now and is on a month to month, but I can't bring myself to tell her she has to go. ""she's working now she can find another place, right?"" - That's the thing... The average rent for a far smaller place than my town home, is like $2,000 a month and I could likely get around $2,600 per month for my place if I rented it. But I just couldn't bring myself to put such an absurd price on a rental and chose to rent it FAR below market (something I would've done whether or not this lady moved in), so I am renting it to her for $1,250 - Something I know she will never get anywhere else. 

So I am just stuck. I have read about selling it with her in it, but signing her to a year lease first so she can finish her lease even with a different owner, but I am certain any investor will jack up the rent immediately after her lease ends or make her leave. On one hand I know I am not responsible for her life, but on the other I don't know what her options would be if she had to leave and I would hate to learn that out of desperation she had to go back to her husband. 

TL;DR - I rented my town home to a single mom with 2 daughters for a rent price I know she won't be able to get anywhere else but have a family emergency that is likely going to require funds I don't have a available to me without selling the home.",1,1,2025-01-21 19:56,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1i6rmgd/i_need_to_sell_my_rental_but_cant_bring_myself_to/,Neutral

Disclaimer 2: After reading this, you might think I'm a terrible person. I sometimes think that too...

  
Sooo, here is the thing. I (21F) live in my family's apartment, in the central part of my country's capital. I don't pay rent, just taxes. I have my own car, I go to a private uni, I receive minimum wage despite not working which, although not much, sustains me, I have an apartment which somebody rents and I might soon start receiving the rent money... all because my mum died.

  
My mum died when I was 13. Suicide. Hardest thing I've ever been through. All those things that I listed above, I'd trade them in a heartbeat if it meant I could get her back. I know that much...

It's f-ed up to say this is a privilege, I know. And yet... I don't know how to explain it. Honest. I learned so much... It's so weird. First of all, the reactions of everyone around me after her death. I've heard and read terrible stories of families doing awful things to a child after his parent/s die. Everyone in my family was supportive and everyone did their best to help me thrive as a person despite that. 

Many times I've been called mature, ambitious, a good and empathetic person... I'm not any of these things by nature. It was all due to my mum's untimely death. She taught me a lot of things, by the way, when she was alive as well and I miss her **very** much. But after she passed, everyone, as I said, took care of me. Everyone! 

Most of my family now is also dead, unfortunately. But... I maybe am just yapping at this point, I dunno. The thing is, I've always been loved, and cared for. Those material things I listed in the beginning, they all make me feel incredibly guilty. All of them. I mean, they are surely nice to have but they are not mine. None of them. In my country, when a child's parent dies, the child receives half of what the parent would have received after retiring considering the amount of time they had worked up to the point of their death. As I said, every month I receive minimum wage. This allows me to have food on the table and pay my taxes without working. When she was alive, my mum took a loan to buy the apartment we were living in when she passed. Now the loan has been payed off but since her passing, there were people who rented it and the money from the rent went towards paying the loan. Soooo now I essentially get to receive the money from that rent. I also inherited her car. The apartment I mentioned in the beginning is not mine, it's my dad's and he gave it to me in order to move out. 

I feel... I don't know how to feel. I have so many things that just aren't mine, that I haven't done anything to receive... so many people don't have that. I have achieved many things by myself in the fields I want to work in and yet... how much of those things would I have received if this didn't happen? I often think about that. I often think that I want to receive a Master's in Social Work and maybe help people that, perhaps, didn't have the same luck as me to be loved and cared for in their darkest times. Because this is the other thing - who would I have been if, after my mum died, my family just abandoned me? Not cared for me? What part of what I call myself did I actually ""build"", and what part was my environment? 

So... yeah, that's it. Thanks if you reached the end of my vent/pity party/whatever *this* is. Appreciate it! :)","I am incredibly privileged in an incredibly f-ed up way Before saying anything, I just want to make two disclaimers:

19235,1i6t8r5,post,I seriously regret my choice to not grow taller (or at least trying to),"30M, 5'2"". (or 157 cm for anyone outside of US)

Growing up, I always knew I was shorter than other kids in my age. I attended all the height-increasing classes at a local recreation center, did lots of jump ropes, was pretty active, and my parents even got me one of those height-increasing supplements for kids, but none of it really seem to help, and I always was the shortest person in class.

I always hoped for that one magical summer when I grow taller dramatically. But that dream was crushed in my middle school years. My parents took me to see doctors for physical exams to see if something was going on with my height. Confirmed on two occasions, I was shorter than the average, and my growth plate was closing a lot sooner than other kids in my age.

I was devastated. I pretty much gave up on growing taller after that. My parents begged me to at least try to squeeze out a few more inches before the growth plates completely closed, but I refused, and argued that it won't make a difference.

I was locked at 5'2"" at the end of high school. At the graduation, I took lots of photos w/ my friends, and there is one with/ four of my female friends, and I am shorter than all of them. It's a funny pic to look back at, but I also look fucking ridiculous and look like a pimp.

Almost 15 years later I really regret my choices back then, and really want to beat myself up for it. Almost no one really seem to take me seriously, especially when it comes to dating. I am painfully aware that while height isn't everything, we are unconsciously and naturally attracted to others who are around or above average height.

I try so hard to forget about it, and focus on my career job, volunteering, hobbies, and other activities. I try hard to learn and be somewhat decent at new skills or knowledge. Now I am in great shape because of hitting the gym 5 days a week, and a decent home chef as well.

But I just feel I look cringy. Everything I do, taller people can make it look 100x more attractive. It doesn't matter if they are better or worse than me, just their heights make the act look so much more sexier, or at the very least dignified and competent.

My family history on both of my parents side show no one was really that tall, so IDK how much more I could've grown taller. But I ponder what my life would've been like had I put in more effort all those years ago","I seriously regret my choice to not grow taller (or at least trying to) 30M, 5'2"".

He keeps talking about how much money he has saved for the wedding and how he wants to be married before next year. I do love him. But the idea terrifies me to my core.

We are long distance. Have been our whole relationship. Neither of us has visited the other in over a year, after I put my foot down and said I wouldn't visit him until he visited me. He hasn't because he doesn't like my family. In our whole relationship he's visited me once for a single day.

I just started a new job on a contract. In person. Not great pay but amazing people and incredible upward mobility. He wants me to ""work towards working remote"" and move in with him. We both still live with our parents for economic reasons. In different states. He wants me to move states. I don't want to move states, not even a little.

He keeps bringing it up. Every time he does I feel like I'm going to throw up from how much it freaks me out. We had a horrible rough patch that lasted a few years where I almost broke up with him - but I didn't because he said he'd be better. He blames all of it on me. He can be so petty, vindictive, and cruel when he feels insulted or ""neglected"". He had an emotional affair at one point and claims it wouldn't have happened if I hadn't been neglecting him (I was severely depressed at the time). He made me feel so insecure about my body out of sheer resentment. I don't know if I can live with that for my whole life. I really don't know.

I don't know if marrying him is the right choice. It wouldn't make me this scared if it was, right? I'm so overwhelmed.

19241,1i6tlzl,post,Feeling like i missed a big opportunity for growth,"A while ago, I chose my gymnasium line. I love natural sciences like chemistry, biology, and math. Math isn’t my favorite, but I’m the best at it—I’ve always been really good at it. My dream was to join the math spets program (a special math-focused version of natural sciences with more math hours and advanced challenges).

At first, I thought I couldn’t get in because you need almost all A's, but then I learned most people get in through a math test. I thought, *This is my chance!*

The test had two parts: one with regular questions (easy for me) and one with five hard problem-solving questions. I love problem-solving in math—it’s fun—but these questions are really tough. The problem was, I only found out about the test one day before and barely had time to prepare. When I practiced with old tests, I could usually solve 2–3 of the hard questions in 30 minutes. Sometimes I got stuck on the harder ones but thought, *No way I’ll fail completely.*

On test day, I breezed through the first part. Then came the second part. I solved the first two questions in 20 minutes, but the next three stumped me. I kept trying, wrote down ideas, and used all the time I had, but I couldn’t figure them out.

I failed.

After the test, I asked if there was still a way to get into the program, but there wasn’t. I started in the regular natural sciences line instead. Most people in my class don’t even like studying, which feels strange for this program. I befriended a group of girls, and they’re fun to hang out with, but I don’t feel like I fit in fully.

The thought of what I missed keeps playing in my head. I later met some math spets students in my Italian class—they’re nerdy, kind, and just like my old friend group. I clicked with them, and it felt like I found my kind of people.

Right now, I’m way ahead in math. In Sweden, we have five levels of math (1–5), and depending on your program, you do them at different speeds. In natural sciences, you’re supposed to finish Math 4 in your final year, but I’m already doing Math 5 because my teacher knows I need a challenge. Math 5 focuses on problem-solving, the fun part of math, so I skipped Math 4 entirely.

Even though I’m doing well, I can’t shake the feeling that I could’ve grown so much more if I’d gotten into the math spets program. They have more math hours, special classes, and the smartest students. Being surrounded by people smarter than me would have motivated me even more.

Now, I feel like I lost one of the best opportunities I’ll ever have to grow and reach my full potential. It’s been half a year since I started gymnasium, and I can’t switch now.

OH BUT THEY MADE A RITUAL AND AN OFFERING AFTERWARDS! These are not nationals, they were all foreigners. Let's not mention all of the other illegals selling our land to more like them. And no, you're not ""expats.""

Stay in your goddamn lawn, chop off your own trees to dance naked in your forest. Keep your stupid desert music festivals to your own and do not come to Mexico, Peru, Bali, the Amazonas, Costa Rica, Belize or whatever other jungle you've heard is ""paradise"" to go to.

At a guess I'd say he's desperately trying to get you stuck with him and the emotional affair, the insulting and harassing you to go remote is all an effort to bully you into submitting. 


Picture yourself ten years from now with this man. You don't see your family at holidays because he makes you miserable if you suggest it. If you have children, he sulks because they need your attention more than he does. He puts you down every time he feels slighted. By the time you finally have enough you've tethered yourself to him with property or shared assets or children and it becomes a massive headache to get him out of your life. 


Don't do it. Being single is so much better than whatever this is. If you want unconditional love, get a dog. If you want good sex, get a vibrator. There's nothing he brings to the table that can't be replaced."," If he's this bad when you're just long distance, he's going to be so much worse if you get married.

19244,1i6tp2p,post,I don’t know how much longer I can fight for my relationship alone.,"I (F22) have been in a relationship with my boyfriend (M26) for over two and half years now. I love him dearly. I want to spend our future together. I want to marry him and for him to be the father of my children. My family adores him, and I adore his. He even started working with my dad a little over a year into our relationship. But here is the issue. He does not have his priorities right. He still lives at home, and in this economy, I get it. I really do. But he does not have any motivation to move out. I also live at home, but I have been saving recently and would love to move out ASAP. He says he has no interest in ever renting and only wants to buy. But we will not have the money to make a down payment on a house for a very long time. Almost all of his income goes to his vehicles, with not much left to save. He still spends multiple nights a week hanging out with his friends for hours upon hours, instead of making time for an occasional date night. The biggest problem recently, has been his attitude. Anytime I get an attitude or get snippy, I immediately apologize as soon as I realize or as soon as he calls me out for it. But anytime I mention something that he could do differently or ask him not to talk to me the way he does when he’s angry, he snaps. He cusses at me, argues with me, tells me I’m “fucking ridiculous” and it’s as if he can never be wrong or take accountability. He barely apologizes. But if I get an attitude, I’m the worst ever and all I do is nag and his friends can call me names.  The other day, I thought we really had a break through in this behavior. I thought I finally got through to him about it and how it makes me feel like shit. Then today, the same thing happens. I ask him to say something differently, and he snaps and tells me I’m ridiculous and that it’s bullshit. I love him so much, but he is so hot headed and has such a short fuse. He like, doesn’t think?. Idk. I don’t know what else I can do to help save our relationship. He sees no issue with anything, but obviously I have multiple. I love him and truly have no interest in the relationship ending. But i am seriously at my wits end. I don’t know how else to fix this.

19246,1i6tqoi,post,Mother Doesn't Believe that my Stepfather Abused Me,"Before I get this off my chest, let me preface by saying that I grew up as a Jehovah's Witness. This religion is technically a cult and leaving this religion can be very traumatic since they teach their members to shun wrongdoers and sinners and walking away from the religion or (even worst) resigning is a ""shunning"" offense that can cost you every relationship including those with family members. My grandmother, mother, and most of my siblings are from this religion. I married a fellow JW and his family was also part of this religion for several generations.

My stepfather abused me as a child, he did it to my sister as well. We were spending the night sleeping on the living room couch and he came home late after everyone was asleep and abused us both right on that couch. My sister spoke up and my mother didn't believe her, yelled at her, belittled her, and forced her to say that she made it up. I was the oldest but I got so scared, so I didn't say anything. I was scared of the reaction I'd get from her or the shame she would put me through. Later in my mid-teen years he tried fondling me, but I pushed him off and fought my way out of that bedroom. He didn't come after me. Eventually we grew up, my sister turned to drugs cope and would up being someone that craved love from wherever she got it and that had terrible effects on her psyche. She straightened up eventually and we both eventually grew up and moved on. When I was twenty years old, I finally told my mom. She cried, said I should've told her sooner. She said she would talk to him. Nothing ever came of this conversation from my mom and I just moved on with my life. I did my best to block out what happened and I avoided my stepfather as much as possible. I got married to a great young man from the religion and we started a family. I was happy.

Things changed in my late thirties, I decided that I no longer agreed with the teachings of my religion. I didn't want to hate what God hated and I certainly didn't want to teach this to my children. My husband and kids agreed it was time for us to walk away from a religion that was no longer serving us. When I told my family immediately decided to shun me. I thought my mom would be different, surely she wouldn't turn her back on me, not after not being there for me before, not after not believing me about my abuse, not after she had failed to protect me. Instead, she said, ""If my child walks away from Jehovah, they can forget they have a mother."" It broke my heart into a million pieces. I wanted to beg, I wanted to shake her and tell her that that is not how you mother a child. But instead I let the anger consume me and it broke the walls I had kept up to block out the abuse. It's like to took a sledgehammer and broke my wall to piece and everything that happened came flooding back to me. All of the unresolved anger and trauma from the abuse, it just consumed me. I blocked her phone and got a new number so she couldn't call or text me. I gave her exactly what she wanted - no relationship.

Thankfully my husband supported me and I also did therapy for a few years that helped me work through the fact that my mother chose religion over me and chose her abuser husband over me. It hurt so much, but I finally accepted that I'll never get the apology I deserve, she'll never validate my feelings, she'll never believe him over me. I'm in my mid forties now and we have since semi-mended our relation ship. We are on speaking terms again and I caller her to check in now and again. I hadn't her from her in a couple of months and I know she's been struggling since she lost her job, so I called and listened as she vented about not having enough money to cover her expenses. While she spoke, I was making a mental assessment of how much I could afford to send her to support her during these difficult times so she could get by, but then the conversation turned this topic of my stepfather's abuse and she tells me that I have ""my version of things"" and it's not the way she sees them. My stepfather is no longer alive, but she still can't fathom that he would have abused me. I told her that I'm glad she has other children are supporting her  (my siblings) because she wasn't there for me so it's very hard for me to be there for her. I earn more than enough to support my family and could easily cover all of her living expense, but her telling me that she doesn't believe me just hurts so much and fills me with anger all over again! I thought I was past it! But she said this and it's like the would is still fresh and hurts just as much as it did before. Does it ever get better?

Honestly our ""relationship"" wasn't even a relationship, it was more like hanging around with your best friend you think you know but you don't.
This breakup has completely messed me up mentally and I'm having difficulty trying to find a person that would respect my boundaries. 

I'm so tired of dating apps because most people on there have such high expectations and then there's... well those who are only after your body. 

What makes this difficult is that I am terrified of men because of all the bad experiences my friends have had with men but I wouldn't say that I'm not open on dating men. I'm just terrified of getting used and then being tossed aside and I'm so sick and tired of being alone and not being loved I want to be loved. 


I honestly feel so lost and upset falling back into the ""I'll never find somebody who would love me"" pit. This keeps weighing me down every day.

We got to talking and I found him really charming. The bar was closing and he asked me to go to another bar with him. I asked him if he was with someone, he said no. He also said he had a son with his ex and they coparent. Good enough for me. We kissed in the car when he dropped me off and asked me to meet up the next day. We hung out all night, chemistry was off the charts, everything was going great then he showed me his instagram page on his phone. I remembered the username, looked him up, went over to tagged photos and saw that he was indeed not single but married for 10+ years, had not one but two kids with his wife the youngest being only 1. Should have called it a night then but I didn’t. I don’t know what I was thinking but I didn’t even confront him. When the bar closed, we went to another club till 5 am and on the way home we hooked up in his car. The next time I saw him, I confronted him about the fact that he lied to me, except that I was blackout drunk (i was struggling internally with what I’d done) and apparently agreed to just hooking up going forward. Felt like I had already crossed the line so might as well. It’s been months though and we haven’t talked about the elephant in the room since then. We meet up every week/ 2 weeks and hookup in the car. Sometimes we get a hotel. We have amazing sexual chemistry and it’s some of the best sex I’ve ever had. I’m not exactly single myself and I live with family so I can’t bring him to my house. I know exactly who his wife is but I don’t plan on telling her even when we fight. And we fight a lot. About shit like “why were you talking to that man/ woman” when we’re out which is idiotic because we’re not together. What baffles me is she’s really beautiful.

19255,1i6uge7,post,I was taken advantage of by someone I thought was a friend,"Back in 2016, I was 18F (now 26F) and had a long distance relationship that I felt I was so in love with. I'll name him Dave. Dave and I met through the game IMVU and started video chatting and building a connection through that. He was in Nevada, and I lived in New Hampshire, so the distance was pretty far, but we tried to make it work. After about 8 months of dating, he broke a promise to me, and the relationship ended a bit messy. He used to hurt himself and had promised he would stop, but he of course couldn't help himself this one time and broke down telling me his mistake. I cried a lot the next week and was really upset, ignoring his calls and attempts to reach me because I was really upset since I couldn't make him stop.

Then, comes in West. He and I knew each other from elementary school, but we barely even hung out or spent time with each other at all. He randomly reached out to me and had comforted me in his messages. Eventually, he convinced me to come over to his house, and I got dropped off there by my mom so we could play some video games in his room. It wasn't really awkward, and it seemed like we were getting along well and catching up, but after a few hours he started to say things about me that he liked. He would compliment me about my figure, my face, my thicker thighs even, and say that even though I didn't have big boob's, I would still be dateable so I shouldn't lose hope.

I found his behavior to be really odd, but then he told me that even he would date me. We started getting closer, getting more touchy, and letting emotions run a bit wild.. I told him I've never done anything like this and it made me a bit uncomfortable since the territory was unfamiliar. He ended up only touching me a bit before I eventually had to leave. We would still message and he would make comments about how much he wanted me. For a moment, I thought it was actually going to be something new and exciting, but I ended up almost dreading seeing him again.

The next time I came over, West went all out. He had convinced me that it would be alright and he's done it before, but it definitely hurt while he was being rough. I told him it hurt, but he pressed on saying ""it always hurts the first time. Plus, girls like it hard and rough"" so I just kinda played along, thinking that maybe it actually was normal. West finished, but didn't help me to completion. Of course, it wasn't in me when he came, I made sure of that, but he told me to go into the bathroom and clean myself up. That was when I realized I was bleeding as if I had gotten my period.

Mind you, I was also 18 at my first period as well, and I had had it a bit before this experience, so I believed it was starting again after only being off it for a week. However, West had assured me it was because of the ""pop of the cherry"" and I figured he was probably right. He would also ""lovingly"" call me Bloody Mary -and Mary isn't even my name.

After everything, West and I took an Uber to a mall where we were walking around kinda awkwardly. He went into a smoke shop that I wasn't a big fan of (this was before the NH smoking age was raised to 21) so I sat outside the shop in a chair and waited for him to be done in there. It took him at least an hour, and I started feeling really ashamed of my choice by then.

Fast forward to about a week later, and I get a message from another friend of mine, Jenny. She told me that a friend of hers told her that I had my virginity taken by West and that he used me for a bet. I asked her to specify and she told me this:

West and his friends had a better that if he took my virginity, he would get $50.

$50 is all I'm worth?!? Not even a streetwalker charges that low for an hour of her time as far as I know..

But here was the thing that made my skin crawl and my self esteem crumble: his friends were on a call THE WHOLE FUCKING TIME. Just to make sure that he did it and didn't just say that he did it. Their phone call was silenced while they could hear EVERYTHING on our side.

I was furious to say the least, but I tried to keep my calm through all of it. I was supposed to meet up with him again that day, and I took an Uber to his place so I could quickly book a trip home.

Once I got to West's house, and I saw his disgusting face, I slapped him as hard as my strength could possibly muster and sent him flying into his own door. The last thing I said to him was ""I hope your $50 was worth it."" And I walked away, never to see him or talk to him again. I blocked him on everything, and I never looked back.","I was taken advantage of by someone I thought was a friend Back in 2016, I was 18F (now 26F) and had a long distance relationship that I felt I was so in love with. I'll name him Dave. Dave and I met through the game IMVU and started video chatting and building a connection through that. He was in Nevada, and I lived in New Hampshire, so the distance was pretty far, but we tried to make it work. After about 8 months of dating, he broke a promise to me, and the relationship ended a bit messy. He used to hurt himself and had promised he would stop, but he of course couldn't help himself this one time and broke down telling me his mistake. I cried a lot the next week and was really upset, ignoring his calls and attempts to reach me because I was really upset since I couldn't make him stop.

Then, comes in West. He and I knew each other from elementary school, but we barely even hung out or spent time with each other at all. He randomly reached out to me and had comforted me in his messages. Eventually, he convinced me to come over to his house, and I got dropped off there by my mom so we could play some video games in his room.

If I tried to take any asset protection measures like call the credit confirmation line or ask for ID they got really upset. They stayed for about an hour ringing up like 15 separate purchases of 2 of our most expensive products at a time and they were so demanding and scary and literally would reach over me and press buttons in the register themselves. 

It was really terrifying because the 3 of them kinda formed around me, trapping me in. God forbid I didn’t do what they asked I didn’t necessarily have an escape route.  It only that but I had a chance to use my cell phone and take a photo of them and text management, which I almost did, until I realized I had mirrors behind me and they could likely see my phone so I didn’t. I work a single coverage stand inside a bigger department store so I was alone and nobody else was around. Not to mention, today was the one day security wasn’t there.

 My manager thankfully is seemingly supportive but the kind of theft it was (they manually entered the credit cards which is apparently is a big no no) can be terminated instantly for so we’ll see!!!

I kept replaying it in my head asking myself “ why DIDNT I do this?” I was sobbing so hard afterwards and now I can’t stop shaking. Ever since it happened I’ve just been filled with this unending dread.

She said she told him she couldn’t process it and that he has to go to one of our stores again, so he might return. I already called the necessary management about this, but I’m utterly terrified.

19279,1i6vaaq,post,I am paranoid my ex is stalking me even though I don’t have proof,"A few years ago (4 or 5 or so) I started dating someone. We were together for a year and out of nowhere he stopped responding to all my messages. I found his brother’s social media page and found out that he found someone else. It was very painful but I got through it.

After all these years I am paranoid that he stalks me. He mentioned using reddit but I don’t know his username. I’ve gone through so many throwaway accounts because I’m afraid if I post too much about myself he’ll realize it’s me. Every time I post I’m afraid he’ll see it. In fact I’m being very vague about the details of our relationship because I’m scared he’ll read this and know it’s me.

We met on a dating app and I put a nickname as my name. My real name is very unique. Once I felt I trusted him enough I told him my real name. I think he googled me because he asked me about a sport I played in high school that I never mentioned to him. But when you google my name, my high school sports statistics come up.

I don’t like that my name is this unique and so I started a case to change it officially. One of the requirements is to publish it in a newspaper. In my county, the court automatically picks the newspaper that it will be published in. I’ve looked at some other people’s announcements in the newspaper and when you google their name, the announcement appears, so anyone who googles them will know they’ve changed their name.

It looks like the announcement is viewable for one day, and after that when you click the google result the announcement expires and you can’t read the whole thing. But I’m freaking out so much about it. I don’t want everyone to see it, much less him. I’m afraid that he’s set up a google alert for my name so that every time there’s a new result for my name, he’ll see it. 

I chose a very common name along the lines of Sarah or Ashley partially to escape him. But I can never escape him in my head. It genuinely keeps me awake at night. My announcement will be published soon and I don’t know what to do, I’m panicking.

I dread being around him as I hate the way I feel towards him but nothing has been getting better despite that he knows exactly how to fix things. 

If we separate and he still doesn’t change it’s over but I really want it to open his eyes. 

I moved 1,000+ miles to where we live for him and I have no friends or family around so I have no one to talk to about this. I’m embarrassed and emotional and I have no idea what to expect but I really can’t do this anymore.

I’m a 22-year-old in my second year of college, but I’m still retaking most of the first-year courses. I know I messed up badly with my studies, but that’s the reality, and there’s no turning back now. This year, I just can’t seem to find the motivation to do better. I make plans for studying well before a test, but when the time comes, I don’t follow through. I often end up cramming the night before or sometimes taking tests without studying at all, which, unsurprisingly, doesn’t turn out well most of the time.

I feel like I’m so far behind my peers, and it feels impossible to catch up. I’m also consumed by guilt because I’m lying to my family about how I’m doing in college. I can’t bring myself to tell them the truth. What makes it worse is that I’m not even sure this college or degree is the right fit for me anymore. But at the same time, I don’t know what else I want to do. There are a few things that interest me, but I haven’t explored them much.

I’ve thought about studying those fields independently, maybe through courses and certifications, and eventually getting a job. But I’m terrified I’ll fail at that too. I worry that I’m not smart enough to succeed. Lately, I’ve even considered quitting college entirely, which I’ve been debating for a while. But the thought of quitting fills me with even more guilt because I live with my parents, and they’ve spent so much money on my education. I feel like a burden—like I’m not contributing to the household.

I’ve thought about getting a job, moving out, and doing online courses in my free time, but I don’t know how realistic that is. Recently, I had a mental breakdown over everything, and it got so bad that I thought about ending my life. It wasn’t the first time I’ve had such thoughts. I’m not officially diagnosed, but I suspect I might be depressed, and I’m working on seeking help.

I don’t know what to do. I feel stupid, worthless, and incapable.

[NAW],"I have had a lot of bad, worse, and ""somehow even worse"" experiences with therapy in the past.  A big pile of wasted time, effort, and money with nothing to show for it except the knowledge that if I say the wrong thing to the wrong person at the wrong time I might have to talk the cops out of dragging me away in an ambulance at 3:00 am (and what exactly the wrong thing, time, or person *is*, is subject to change that I can neither control nor know).  So ... been doing without.  And things have not gotten better.  Quite the opposite, really.  Quite, quite bad, in fact.

So I decided to try again.  There is literally no one in my life that I can talk to this shit about, so it's therapy or do without until I finally have that stroke.  Figured maybe I'd be okay if I played it close.  Figured maybe I could get a feel in the first few sessions if this person was actually legit. Figured we had (for now) the money to waste on those first few sessions in case they were all a bust.

Nope.

Straight out the gate, not even halfway through session one, they took a hard right turn onto Asshole Boulevard, with an added stop at Yelling At Me That I'm Stupid Lane.  The one saving grace was that it was all via Zoom so I could just tell them ""We're at the point where I'm going to cut the session short and pay you the full price so my credit doesn't take a hit, goodbye"" and just hang up.  

And then, just to rub it all in, my spouse gave me shit for cutting the session short, because it turns out they: (1) *could* hear the whole thing, and (2) *chose to listen* to the whole thing.  

So yeah, just gonna cross my fingers and hope for that stroke now.  Should only take a few more years.","Thought I'd try therapy again. Thought maybe it would go better this time. Nope.

So I decided to try again.  There is literally no one in my life that I can talk to this shit about, so it's therapy or do without until I finally have that stroke.  Figured maybe I'd be okay if I played it close.  Figured maybe I could get a feel in the first few sessions if this person was actually legit. Figured we had (for now) the money to waste on those first few sessions in case they were all a bust.

Nope.

Straight out the gate, not even halfway through session one, they took a hard right turn onto Asshole Boulevard, with an added stop at Yelling At Me That I'm Stupid Lane.  The one saving grace was that it was all via Zoom so I could just tell them ""We're at the point where I'm going to cut the session short and pay you the full price so my credit doesn't take a hit, goodbye"" and just hang up.  

And then, just to rub it all in, my spouse gave me shit for cutting the session short, because it turns out they: (1) *could* hear the whole thing, and (2) *chose to listen* to the whole thing.  

So yeah, just gonna cross my fingers and hope for that stroke now.  Should only take a few more years.",1,1,2025-01-21 22:37,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1i6vioc/thought_id_try_therapy_again_thought_maybe_it/,Neutral

i fucked up with my credit cards and between the interest rates and falling a little short between paychecks for necessities(mainly gas + food) i dont think im going to ever be able to fix it. 

Im not working as much as i used to by a mix of low hours with work and not being available due to having to care for my children (2, <5 yrs old). its to the point where im not even sure of what to do. 

I tried to see if i could get a loan (my cards add up to ~9k) to pay them off and lump my payments into one so im not racking up crazy interest. i finally tried to apply for one and nope. denied because my debt to income ratio is too high. 

i just feel so incredibly stupid and so sad and so many other things. 

for now ill just keep trying to bring the balances down but like it feels so defeating to have over half of my payments not even do anything with interest. 

I remind myself i am still okay because i have a roof over my head and my children are fed and clothed and cared for- but man the constant worry of if itll ger better is just killing me.","stress just keeps building im sure a lot of others are probably in the same position of feeling overwhelmed by their finances but i just need go let my concerns out.

19295,1i6vr3j,post,My family aren’t listening to me,"I’ve grown up around dogs all my life but since around the age of 10 I have been absolutely terrified of them. However, I don’t know where this fear has stemmed from. My family had a dog at the time called Millie she wasn’t really any trouble but I kept my distance and didn’t say that I was afraid of dogs as we have had her for so long. Millie passed away in April 2024 at the age of 14 which was devastating for my family. My mom and dad missed her alot and everyday kept talking about wanting a new dog. I then expressed my feelings about being scared of dogs multiple times afterwards and that I was not too sure on getting a new dog since I have to live here too. 

They kept denying the fact I am scared of dogs because I’ve been around them my whole life and obviously I never exactly had a real reason to be scared of them since I haven’t had a horrible experience with one. My only reasons are that every dog I’ve come across has been way too in my face and jumpy, extremely overwhelming always right infront of me and wont leave me alone. That I find it uncomfortable and aggravating to be around such a needy pet, they’re always stealing food or biting something or scratching something and barking, it’s too much to cope with. Not to mention the strong smell. With having autism I have no idea how little or big my reaction is gonna be if the dog does something that I won’t like and because of this I don’t want to scare the dog and then fear it may attack me in the future. My outbursts are uncontrollable and It’s not something I can help at the moment. Dogs are extremely unpredictable and I just find it really hard to be around them.

Anyways, my parents ignored my feelings and brought a puppy unexpectedly in the new year without telling me. I got sent a picture of the puppy and a “Don’t be mad at me” text. I was infuriated because this is a massive change to my life and no-one even bothered to think about me or tell me we were getting one and that it would be in our house within the next week. My disappointment was not the response my mom was hoping for. We had multiple arguments over it that week and I had a horrible meltdown which got ignored. All my parents had to say about it is “Be happy for us” and that I’m selfish which is ridiculous because surely they’re selfish for not thinking about my feelings? 

I’m trying so hard to adjust to the fact there is a new pet in the house but I’m still finding it exceptionally difficult to be around the puppy. Today I thought I’d be nice and spend time with the puppy and take her out of the crate to play with her while my parents were out to get food but it all got too much and she was jumping at me too much and trying to bite my feet on the sofa and I froze up and got extremely nervous and i screamed at her without meaning to, it came out as I was panicking and it made her scared and show aggression to me which obviously it was my fault but I can’t help it and I didn’t know what to do at the time. I messaged my mom for help as they were on the way back to our house however it made me panic more and she kept trying to jump at me and kept barking at me at my face and then hid and scratched the door and thats when I called my parents and they started screaming at me because I opened the living room door to let the puppy out of the room since I was getting really scared and then my parents arrived home to help. I know this is definitely embarrassing to read as it’s only a puppy but I tried to do something nice and get over my fear but now I’m even more scared then I was and all my mom has to say is “don’t be scared of her” with a guilty face while holding the puppy cuddling her whilst I was panicking and telling me off during my panic attack? My dad eventually calmed me down when I told him to take them both out of the room since I was struggling to breathe under the criticism. Now the puppy keeps whining at me and it’s making me worried to leave my room and my mom keeps forcing me to pet her when I don’t want to. Dogs understand when a person is scared very clearly and because shes only a puppy moments like these can turn into aggression in their adulthood and now that she knows I’m afraid I’m scared that shes gonna bite me. I don’t know what to do

My ex and I have a lot of mutual friends, so I thought it would be the right thing to do to tell him that I would be doing this so he didn’t hear it back from anyone else. 

I spoke to him, and when I saw him every single feeling came rushing back. I’m still completely, irrevocably in love with him.

19304,1i6w6cl,post,Would you consider this flirting?,"I’m not sure if this is the right place to post this

I told a guy that I speak to regularly that I had a boyfriend and I assumed he would respect that and keep our conversations platonic and respectful. He has flirted with me in the past and I have never reciprocated because I don’t see him that way, so I’d either ignore it or ask him to stop. Recently, I posted a collage of photos of myself and he replied to my story on Instagram saying “You’re such a prize. Keep it up” He then proceeded to text me three more times over the course of two weeks trying to make conversation in odd ways. I then sent him a text basically expressing my displeasure with him flirting with me after I’ve repeatedly asked him not to. After a long while of just friendly conversation every other week or month, that was when the “prize” incident happened. I am in a relationship, so I’m gonna cut contact with this guy because I feel like it’s disrespectful to your partner to keep speaking to someone that’s trying to get with you knowing you’re in a relationship. The main issue here is there’s a history of flirting. If he’d never flirted with me in the past, I probably would’ve taken it as a friendly compliment. But I just can’t see it that way. I’m just sort of sick and tired of guys pretending to be my friend with ulterior motives, especially when I am in a relationship and they know this","Would you consider this flirting?

Your face and body are not done changing, and as you get older your features are likely to mature with you. Even so, you can try little things like working out to decrease your overall fat percentage or eating less sodium/sugar to reduce puffiness and extra fat, but don’t go overboard with it. Make sure you’re still eating enough, and just focus on being completely healthy and happy! As a teenager, we think every feature is something to be insecure about, when in reality they just make you look human. Own your uniqueness! Life would be so dull if we all looked the same."," I understand how you feel, I also have a higher amount of fat on the bottom half of my face. Keep in mind, you are only 15!

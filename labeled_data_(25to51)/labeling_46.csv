26537,m7sa976,comment,,"Happy Birthday, my friend. I can relate to you a lot. I am actually alone in boston rn because I attempted to go to a concert alone last night. Couldn’t get the courage to actually go alone though once it was time. I also feel like no one likes me. I am not very confident at all either, people seem to be uncomfortable with vulnerability which I never understood considering we are all human. Keep going please. I am 24, you are still so young. Been considering suicide for a long time but I refuse to believe this is all for nothing. We still have more years to find out what life can give us. We gotta find out. I try to think about Ying Yang at times like these. You cannot get good without bad. So, all this bad must mean some good is coming. You sound like a good person and karma is real. I hope you realize it may be lonely to be vulnerable, but I always feel its better than going thru life overly confident without a second thought or care. It sounds like what you do has thought and meaning out into it. Thats an amazing trait. And personally, i think vitiligo is like art. You are a canvas and not everyone can appreciate such a work of art. happy birthday my friend. I am not so good with my words but I just think you are doing great and have utmost respect for you and believe in you. i know it sucks. people are mean and distracted. rarity is always considered a good thing with material items, but not with people. i think its a great you are who you are. like a rare pokemon u know? you are the only person who can be you. and thats so so cool i think."," Happy Birthday, my friend.

I’m gonna seem like a grumpy old man but I really don’t care about bdays anymore. I think it’s important to focus time/energy for kids bdays but I can’t focus on all these adult birthdays too. If I did id be going to 90 birthday parties every single year.

Maybe we consolidate them into a monthly birthday like they did in the office. I can’t go one week without being asked to attend some birthday/holiday event. I’m pretty burned out I guess."," Everytime I see a post here about people forgetting someone’s birthday I remember the year where I didn’t even realize it was my own birthday until several days after.

Also for what it's worth I absolutely love people with vitiligo as in I find it super attractive! Hand to God prob wanna of my biggest weaknesses and I would take it in a heartbeat if I could. The point is though is there's so many people in this world. So many people you haven't met yet. Things you don't like about yourself someone is going to adore. But I think in order to find them you have to love yourself there. 

I suffered from low self esteem for most of my life until I hit my late 20's. I put in work to change that, so for what it's worth here are some things I did. 

The first is I wrote a list of everything I liked about myself. My eyes, my empathy.... Anything and everything, nothing is too small to be on that list. Before I even got out of bed every morning I read it OUT LOUD to myself to start my day. 

I also did daily gratitude lists. It doesn't have to be every thing. Pick 3 things on your drive into work to appreciate. 

Lastly when you're hurting do the last thing you prob want to do.... Go so something nice for someone else. It helps take us out of our own thoughts, it also feels good to be kind to others. It can be simple, buy a coffee for someone, send someone a nice text that you appreciate them, go donate your old clothes to a shelter....

I have always been rather forgettable.  Not sure why to be honest, still don't after decades.

I can dress up well, and a little differently than the norm, and very outgoing and I get lots of attention.  But it's a mask and not me, something I out on for a show.  I get invited out, etc.

After a while I get exhausted with the performance, and go back to being me.  Invites stop coming, and I go back to being rather forgettable again.

The cycle of my life.  I've been to therapy and that has helped a lot.  In the end, I've focused ona few very key real friendships and it's made a world of differnece, but it has taken 10 yrs of effort to find a balance and my people.

Still not easy, but I move on.  Take care brother, try new things, and hopefully you will find your niche.

Feelings come and go. They are very temporary. 
Don’t make a permanent decision based on a temporary feeling.

I recommend checking out www.nami.org
They have group meetings for people with mental health issues.  You may find someone that you can relate to. Lots of resources there.

Coldplay is AWESOME!!! One of my favorites!!
I’m sorry your friends are not responsive to this. Hell with them. 
Sell the other 3. Go anyway. You may meet better friends by selling those tickets. 

Also…
Vitiligo 
I’ve got it. A bunch of family members have it. 
Best thing I can recommend to you is to own it and spread awareness. It may define your looks but it doesn’t define your heart and your soul. 
Anyone that judges you based on that, isn’t worth a second of your time."," Hey man.

Also do attend that concert, you deserve to see your favorite band. Even if it means going alone. I'm going to a concert alone in Amsterdam this July bc I don't know anyone who likes the music. It's a big step but I'm going to show myself I'm strong and I can do stuff that makes me happy alone. I hope you find the courage from all these messages and know you are loved across the globe. You matter❤️

Secondly, please let me clarify that I am not insinuating that your friends are awful people. Something VERY important to remember is that everyone has SOMETHING going on behind the scenes.

As you have seen, even thousands of strangers have reached out to you because you made it known what you are going through.

And if ever you feel alone again, know that you don’t have to be.

I’ve been a Christian now for a couple years, and the difference in life knowing that no matter what, I am loved by Jesus, is beyond comprehension.

Friend, you’ve lived a life of sin and mistakes. Some you may regret, and others you may forget. But all of this sin has separated you from the God who made you and loves you. And God is good, and therefore just, so he must punish evil.
And for the sin you’ve committed, you have earned the punishment of death and hell.

But this is the good news that shows the heart of God.
He knew you would struggle to be holy, He knew you couldn’t live to be perfect like Him, so He sent His Son, Jesus, to die in your place. God paid the bill for your soul. And if you don’t believe me, look into the evidence. There’s so much of it.
But know this:

You don’t ever have to be alone again.
People came to your rescue today. But it was God who sent them. Because He wants you, and He has a plan for you.
But God asks that you give up your life of chasing sin and darkness, and to chase after righteousness and truth.

Jesus says:
“God loved the world in this way: He gave His Son to die for them. And if anyone would believe in His Son, whom He sent, he will not perish, but have everlasting life.”

God just asks that you turn from your sin and Trust and Believe in Him. That’s it. That’s all He asks, and He will be with you in it always.

Please consider what I’ve said and even test what I’ve said.

You don’t ever have to feel alone. God is always there. And He can be more than just a savior. He can be that friend you’ve always wanted. The father you never had. The love of a mother, all of it, Jesus is your answer.

I’m glad you were reached by God. And I’m glad you’re alive today.

We may never cross paths, and even if we do, we may never know who each other are, and may not share a word but I know my life would all the richer for it

Carry on being you and the light and joy you are",1,,2025-01-18 12:38,t3_1i3oqiz,,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1i3oqiz/todays_my_28_birthday_and_i_am_going_to_end_it/m7sk9vx/,Neutral

26739,m7sklhu,comment,,"Happy belated birthday, friend. I'm saddened to hear you didn't receive any birthday kindness, love, or wishes. I can relate to being left out and wondering who would actually care if i was gone. I'm one of the friends they jokingly call the forgotten one, always seeing my friends and even family going out for lunch or dinners and wishing I was there but also angry that i was forgotten in the first place. When everyone claims they love me and love hanging out with me, if it were true, why am I always left out then. From what I've read, you have people who will go with you to coldplay now. It makes me glad to hear. I asked many of my friends to go to Coldplay when they where in Australia not to long ago and they didn't want to go because they didn't like their music and the last thing I wanted to do is go to a concert by myself. I hated the thought of it and ok ok, gair enough, i wouldn't want to sit and watch a band i didn't like either BUT if it was for a friend who had no one else I would've gone for them and made myself enjoy being there but thats not what happened. I can't change how others act, and I can't change the past. I can only change how I react. A couple of things I've had to learn is that you can't make others care about you and think if you'd like to do something or hang out. you just move on and find your people. People who are genuine and thoughtful and want to be around you and message you every now and then it doesn't have to be every minute of every day but every couple of days and it goes both ways you do the same because you care. I don't really know where I'm going with this, but just know one day you will find your people and looking back, you will think, wow, I've really found people that I can be myself around and they genuinly care about me. Now I'm not saying these things are instant they do take time, think of it like a nice aged cheese it's not gonna be ready in a day it take time and the longer it sits the better it tates. I really hope you enjoy the concert and if you would like feel free to update us so we can live though you :> P.S. I'm sorry if this doesn't make much sense. Im hoping it does. Im terribly dyslexic and writing is NOT at all one of my strengths. Things tend to get a little mix when trying to get it out. Again, Happy's birthday, friend :)"," Happy belated birthday, friend.

I remember my cat rubbing up against me like ""hey, where you been"" and I realized life was just where I'd left it. 

I eventually got some help. It was slow and painful but it was what I needed. I emotionally burned it down and built it back up. I still don't have a lot of friends but I have a few people who care about me and I guess that's better than nothing. But I'm glad I'm still here.

I'm really glad I'm still here. 

I've accomplished so much since that night. I've tried my hardest to be a force for good, for compassion, and for empathy in a pretty mean world. Some days I'm more successful than other days. But I'm glad I'm still here.

I guess in your case your love and care for the things that mattered to you the most just simply wasn’t a priority for others and they probably didn’t mean it to be that way., Bro I have 4 kids and a great woman and many great friends and I felt ‘sort of’ like you.

When you’re in the thick of those dark moments, it’s so easy to think you’re alone, that nobody cares, and that your presence or absence wouldn’t matter. But this? This proves how incredibly wrong that mindset is.

The thing that stands out most here is connection. Look at what happened when you opened up. Vulnerability—real, raw vulnerability—brought thousands of people together to lift you up. That’s not something you see every day. It’s a reminder that people do care, even strangers on the internet, and sometimes you just need to give them the chance to show it.

But let me get a little blunt here: the world will try to convince you that your worth is tied to your relationships, your looks, or your “success.” That’s a lie. You’re valuable simply because you exist. The fact that your post resonated with so many people? That’s proof that your story matters. Your life matters.

Also, let’s not underestimate the bravery it takes to admit you’re struggling. You didn’t just sit there and let the darkness consume you—you reached out. That’s strength. And now you’re waking up to realize that the world isn’t as cold as it seemed last night.

This isn’t just a happy Reddit ending. It’s a lesson. Speak up when you’re struggling. Ask for help. Be honest. And remember: no matter how isolated you feel, there’s a community out there willing to stand by you. Sometimes, you just have to let them know you need it.

So take those Coldplay tickets, grab whoever’s willing to join you, and celebrate the fact that you’re here, alive, and surrounded by people rooting for you. You deserve that. ❤️"," Wow.

I understand life is difficult for you right now and you deserve better friends! i hope you found some joy reading other redditors' comments and i hope you see how valued you are, even if we're just a bunch of strangers online we're all connected in one way or another. 

Even if you do end up having to go alone, dont miss out on the chance to see your favourite band live! theres going to be plenty of other fans around you and you could even ask if you could sit with the people next to you and spend your time with them! im sure they wont mind! 

ive lost a family member to suicide and even though i didnt know him well enough and only met him once, i still mourned and wished he was here still. dont take your friends and family not calling as a reason to end your life, sometimes you just need to find people out there that will give you joy and happiness. If your friends are pricks then thats on them, thats not because of you. 

Vitiligo is beautiful, and i think a lot of people on this thread would agree with me on this. you're unique and uniqueness is beautiful. If someone were to have that against you, a condition you cannot control, they arent worthy of being in your life and being valued by you.

Even been to a therapist about it (and you should too if you can afford it). I have had thoughts like you. Though I know I wouldn’t have made that choice, those thoughts add to your despair. It makes you focus on the point of it all.

I’m in my 50’s now. And I have had ebbs and flows like this my whole life. When I was younger than you,  other than family and your skin condition, I could relate. Though, I had physical issues that made me insecure.

But I fought every day. One day at a time. Did what I needed to feel good about myself. I got a job and worked hard to excel at it. I continued to put myself out there socially. And to this day, I’m still the outside person never the inside person. Never the one that gets called first. But my confidence allowed me to build a friend network. It allowed me to have confidence and get married and have kids.

Life is long and in many ways I’d give so much to be 28 again knowing how much living and maturing and finding yourself happens over the next 20 years

I too was a bit of a nerd, geek in school. I had no friends I never went to a party. I didn’t date until my fourth year of college (and I mean in every respect). I was average at school and lazy.

But I kept trying. I knew there was always a tomorrow if I made the most of today. I realized it won’t change over night or in a month or two. I knew in six months I’d see only little change.

On a different note, it appears that your vitiligo is making you very self conscious and affecting your self esteem. Which is understandable and normal.

Their ability to rise above their difficulty and be indifferent to it, draws people to them like magnets simply because the ""non limited"" ones are in complete awe, because it is so hard for them.

I also have some friends who don't necessarily tag me on posts but will tag others. I do believe I'm cool but I'm not their cool/fashionable friend worth tagging.

If someone tells you no, that just created a new opportunity to go enjoy that experience by yourself. You might loose the shared company and shared experience, but what you gain is your own personal experience that you can tailor to be as enjoyable as YOU want it. 

I'm given up on people remembering my birthday. Heck I've been around people, on my day, and they had no clue until after the fact, I don't hold them to it cause honestly your true day of birth was the day you exited the womb. Everything else is just the anniversary of that. Not ever sun cycle will you have other people to celebrate your anniversary of birth with and that's ok. 

Go out and do everything you would want to do with someone by yourself. You might be surprised you meet a stranger that makes your night end even better than it started.

If someone tells you no, that just created a new opportunity to go enjoy that experience by yourself. You might loose the shared company and shared experience, but what you gain is your own personal experience that you can tailor to be as enjoyable as YOU want it. 

I'm given up on people remembering my birthday. Heck I've been around people, on my day, and they had no clue until after the fact, I don't hold them to it cause honestly your true day of birth was the day you exited the womb. Everything else is just the anniversary of that. Not ever sun cycle will you have other people to celebrate your anniversary of birth with and that's ok. 

Go out and do everything you would want to do with someone by yourself. You might be surprised you meet a stranger that makes your night end even better than it started.

26970,m7swnoa,comment,,"I don’t know what else to say that everyone else hasn’t said already, but I’m glad you posted & shared how you were feeling, even though I know you must have been feeling very sad & lonely when you wrote this. I think many of us have felt how you’re feeling - I’ve been there myself when I was younger & feeling like the people in your life don’t care about you, or looking around & seeing people with busy social lives - it’s very hard not to compare yourself or life to there’s. When I was a young teenager, (I’m in my mid 30s now) I had friendships that were very transient, people I thought were my friends but would hurt me or I’d realize we weren’t really my friends (we just had a mutual class or activity in common & I thought that made us friends, but there was no genuine connection there.) I started making new friends, & I remember introducing them to each other, & then feeling like they were excluding me - I ended up attempting suicide because I felt like no one cared about me or would even miss me. For whatever reason, (obviously) that attempt was unsuccessful & I’m still here… 

My teens-mid 20’s were rough, as they are for most people, & social media certainly doesn’t help when you feel like your relationships or your job or your life doesn’t measure up, but one of the best things I ever did was stop using social media (this was back when it was mostly just Facebook, & Instagram was starting out.) Just avoiding looking through other people’s feeds & photos & comparing my life to the way theirs’ looked online, that made a huge difference. And it freed me up to focus on myself, my own interests, & developing a life & a rhythm that made me happy, & that naturally lead to me meeting people who I had things in common with, & a lot of those relationships were casual, but I also developed a few very close friendships with people, who I can go a year or two without seeing, but we can pick up like no time has passed. 

I don’t mean to make it sound like it’s that simple (like the cliche “you have to learn to love yourself before you can expect anyone else to love you” - I hate that!) but I do think that, especially in your late 20’s, you really start to get to know yourself & pursue things in life that are importantly to you, & that can really help to build your self-confidence, so that when people come into your life, you know if they are worth your time or not, & I do think that you start to naturally attract like-minded people when you find your groove in life.

It’s human nature to seek out connection - we all want to feel loved & like we matter to others. Sometimes, our family or close friends can let us down, & it may or may not be a reflection of how important we are to them. When we go through periods of life where it feels like no matter what we do or how hard we try, nothing is going our way, & it’s easy to feel like it will always be that way. I know if I were in your shoes & someone left me this comment, I’d probably be thinking “you have no idea how much I’m hurting, & you have no way of knowing that things will get better for me,” & you might be right.  But the fact that you reached out, the best way you could, on a forum full of strangers; to see the response that you got, I hope that gives you a little bit of hope that there is a place for you here in this world, & your people are out there - you might find them here on Reddit, or by pursuing a hobby out in the world, who knows?!

Idk if anything I’m saying is at all helpful, & idk really even what point I was trying to make, but I saw your post & couldn’t help but comment, because I really felt what you were feeling & I just wanted you to know you’re not alone & even though your birthday was disappointing, & your family let you down, I hope today & the next day will be even better. Please update about the concert - I hope you made some new friends from Reddit & had a great time! Happy birthday! I hope this is your best year yet!❤️"," I don’t know what else to say that everyone else hasn’t said already, but I’m glad you posted & shared how you were feeling, even though I know you must have been feeling very sad & lonely when you wrote this.

For whatever reason, (obviously) that attempt was unsuccessful & I’m still here… 

My teens-mid 20’s were rough, as they are for most people, & social media certainly doesn’t help when you feel like your relationships or your job or your life doesn’t measure up, but one of the best things I ever did was stop using social media (this was back when it was mostly just Facebook, & Instagram was starting out.) Just avoiding looking through other people’s feeds & photos & comparing my life to the way theirs’ looked online, that made a huge difference. And it freed me up to focus on myself, my own interests, & developing a life & a rhythm that made me happy, & that naturally lead to me meeting people who I had things in common with, & a lot of those relationships were casual, but I also developed a few very close friendships with people, who I can go a year or two without seeing, but we can pick up like no time has passed. 

I don’t mean to make it sound like it’s that simple (like the cliche “you have to learn to love yourself before you can expect anyone else to love you” - I hate that!) but I do think that, especially in your late 20’s, you really start to get to know yourself & pursue things in life that are importantly to you, & that can really help to build your self-confidence, so that when people come into your life, you know if they are worth your time or not, & I do think that you start to naturally attract like-minded people when you find your groove in life.

It’s human nature to seek out connection - we all want to feel loved & like we matter to others. Sometimes, our family or close friends can let us down, & it may or may not be a reflection of how important we are to them. When we go through periods of life where it feels like no matter what we do or how hard we try, nothing is going our way, & it’s easy to feel like it will always be that way. I know if I were in your shoes & someone left me this comment, I’d probably be thinking “you have no idea how much I’m hurting, & you have no way of knowing that things will get better for me,” & you might be right.  But the fact that you reached out, the best way you could, on a forum full of strangers; to see the response that you got, I hope that gives you a little bit of hope that there is a place for you here in this world, & your people are out there - you might find them here on Reddit, or by pursuing a hobby out in the world, who knows?!

Idk if anything I’m saying is at all helpful, & idk really even what point I was trying to make, but I saw your post & couldn’t help but comment, because I really felt what you were feeling & I just wanted you to know you’re not alone & even though your birthday was disappointing, & your family let you down, I hope today & the next day will be even better. Please update about the concert - I hope you made some new friends from Reddit & had a great time! Happy birthday! I hope this is your best year yet!❤️",1,,2025-01-18 14:03,t3_1i3oqiz,,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1i3oqiz/todays_my_28_birthday_and_i_am_going_to_end_it/m7swnoa/,Neutral

26974,m7swsqb,comment,,"Many years ago, I heard Steve Martin in an interview.

In it, he asked what is the worst hurt that someone can go through.  He suggested that it was the loss of a child as a parent.

He pointed out that there are perceived hurts, like longing for someone or putting them on a pedestal, only for them not to treat you the way you want to treat them.  Those perceived hurts feel just as painful as the real losses.

This was an interesting insight from a guy best known for comedy.  You would think comedians (and he used to be one, but has been a comedic actor for a long time) would lead happy lives, but that's often not the case.

Comedians do comedy to get affirmation.  They crave audience laughter.  It's either an addiction or it fills a hole in their self esteem or some combination of the both.  They're often driven to comedy not due to being happy, but due to not being happy."," Many years ago, I heard Steve Martin in an interview.

Find a good therapist and work them on becoming emotionally independent. Meaning you no longer need to depend on others for your emotionally wellbeing.

You will be emotionally strong for them when they need, and they will be emotionally strong when you need.

27023,m7t0d69,comment,,"(Tw talks of suicide) I know how you feel to some degree. Because no two people experince the same emotions the same exact way. two years ago I was probably about 17 in high school. Things weren’t going too great. I got to somewhat of a disagreement with my mom and I try to OD on some pills. I was in the hospital for a week in the moment, it at least something that I truly wanted to do but as soon as I took them, I saw my parents reaction when they kicked down my door. I just felt so lost on why I did it I guess not necessarily that want to die more like, I just didn’t wanna feel alone/ feel anything I just wanna kinda not exist. Two years later I found really helpful for me at least just compliment people on the streets if you like a T-shirt, you like somebody’s hair, shoes, whatever etc. to see somebody they may have a smile you don’t know what they go through. It made a difference for me, and it can strike up a conversation sometimes. Please don’t go through with it, I lost a close friend in 9th grade to suicide, and i think about it daily what I could have done better to help, if I should have reached out. I feel as if I am guilty for not being a good enough friend sometimes. I will leave with this remark, on my 18th birthday the first thing I did was get a tattoo to say “the world is a better place with you in it”. I am not saying to go out and get a tattoo (unless you want to ofc) but get something of meaning, a collectable that reminds you of something good, a book you remember opened your eyes to a world of fantasy. Anything that can act as an anchor of some sorts. I know most will not see this reply. But I hope I can reach a few to help. My messages are open to all and any that just need to talk to some. I am always here to listen.

I was in the hospital for a week in the moment, it at least something that I truly wanted to do but as soon as I took them, I saw my parents reaction when they kicked down my door. I just felt so lost on why I did it I guess not necessarily that want to die more like, I just didn’t wanna feel alone/ feel anything I just wanna kinda not exist. Two years later I found really helpful for me at least just compliment people on the streets if you like a T-shirt, you like somebody’s hair, shoes, whatever etc. to see somebody they may have a smile you don’t know what they go through. It made a difference for me, and it can strike up a conversation sometimes. Please don’t go through with it, I lost a close friend in 9th grade to suicide, and i think about it daily what I could have done better to help, if I should have reached out. I feel as if I am guilty for not being a good enough friend sometimes. I will leave with this remark, on my 18th birthday the first thing I did was get a tattoo to say “the world is a better place with you in it”. I am not saying to go out and get a tattoo (unless you want to ofc) but get something of meaning, a collectable that reminds you of something good, a book you remember opened your eyes to a world of fantasy. Anything that can act as an anchor of some sorts. I know most will not see this reply. But I hope I can reach a few to help. My messages are open to all and any that just need to talk to some. I am always here to listen. Have a great day all, and to the op, I really wish nothing but the best because I know these times can be scary.",1,,2025-01-18 14:26,t3_1i3oqiz,,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1i3oqiz/todays_my_28_birthday_and_i_am_going_to_end_it/m7t0d69/,Neutral

27029,m7t0mrc,comment,,"Well happy birthday, but you have to realize people are busy with their own shit. If you are that lonely move back to the town where your family is. But after you goto the coldplay show! 

  I've been where you are several years ago. I'm starting to get up there a little in age now and I have realized that the only person that holds the key to my happiness is me. 

 If your ""friends"" don't have time to celebrate with you then step out of your comfort zone. Go somewhere or do something you've always wanted to buy been too scared or anxious to actually go. You'll probably meet new like indeed people that will actually enjoy your company! 

  Life is not easy, unless you were born with the proverbial silver spoon in your mouth, for most of us it is a struggle. Some struggle in silence, others lash out, but then there are others that laugh at the struggle because they know eventually that struggle will end and things get better until the next struggle. 

  There are people that care about you that love you. If you check out that will devastate more than a few people. I don't know you at all but you can reach out any time to chat. I'm sure there are several others in this thread that wouldn't mind a bit! 

  Hell I'd go to see Coldplay if you were in my town! I've been to a few concerts alone and met some really cool people that turned into friends, and had amazing experiences that I wouldn't have ever had if I went with a group! That could be your first step out of your safe area. GO FOR IT!

Either by this point I should be having stories to pass to younger generation to share my wisdoms, or be trained up enough to be furthering our culture in sciences or arts... neither of which I was doing.

Wild pro tip if you go through this again and want to get dramatic -- if in the USA, look up seasonal work. Places like coolworks have seasonal employment and often come with employer provided housing and meals included. Crappy dorm living conditions but you are thrust into a whole new world, and meet people from all walks of life. Many of these transient folks grind money for 6 months and travel the other 6 months. Not unheard of to leave your apartment back home and just make payments from wherever you're working.  It's possible to put your life on pause or even leave it all behind. There's whole new worlds out here hiding very close nearby. Unfortunately I probably have twice my lifespan to go through again, if not more -- it's not impossible to start from scratch and find happiness through unexpected places or methods.

I am an educator and life coach.  Let me give you some advice.....

You are not alone!  God loves you. We all suffer and struggle every single day.  This world is very hard to live in.  The world is not the same as 15, 20, or 30 years ago.

  Don't give a permanent solution to temporary problems!

You are blessed 🙌.  You have health, 2 hands, 2 feet, intelligence and a big heart! Many people struggle day by day with their health. There are people who suffer more than you.

  People nowadays lack your beautiful spirit.  Most people are envious and cruel.

Those people who treated you badly let them eat cake.  They will get their Karma. 

May your pain be your strength.  Go do volunteer work at a non-profit organization. Not only you will feel good you will make people happy. You might even make friends there. 

Stay in school. Get an education.  Go to college and go to a college advisor. They will guide you on what your strengths are.  Based on those strengths, they will guide you to a career of your choice.  

Or think a little about what you like. Do you like math, computers, teaching, art, music, etc.

As you are working on yourself, go ASAP to a mental health professional, please! They will give you the tools you need to be able to face life. 

We all love you here!  I send you a big Birthday cake! 

🎂 🥳.  🫶

Stay strong!   💪 🤘","

As you can see from the other comments, there are MANY people out there who'd want to be your friend.

We often feel alone when we see that people in our immediate line of sight don't seem to value us, and that makes us feel there is something wrong with us. But the truth is, there are a lot of people on earth. For every person that is too busy to be part of your plans, there is someone who will be 100% on board with it.

It's just that we are sometimes dealt with a bad hand of cards where none that we have are viable, but you should focus on reshuffling until you find the ones you need.. not fold the game entirely."," happy belated birthday op :"") sorry for being late.

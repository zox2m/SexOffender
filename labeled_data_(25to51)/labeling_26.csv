I would recommend reporting him but if you don't want to, the next time he touches your breast, say ""don't touch me"". That should be a warning sign you are not going to tolerate it.

i guess im carrying this heavy feeling of knowing that i encouraged it as a kid, so i feel like its not sa but then again i was so young so. i just feel like it was my fault you know. seriously. like for example as a kid id play games and see how long i could kiss him for and stuff. or i didnt do anything when he would watch me change when i was much older before i got in the shower. when i was younger even, we would play this game im pretty sure i started where i would slide down his body, but when my mum came downstairs he would shove me off all of a sudden and tell me to stop even though it was fine before. like i dont know. i get i was oblivious as a kid but. i encouraged that. so i dont feel like it was sa, not just for the fact that these things are really tame and i dont remember anything really bad happening but because also i encouraged it.

14768,m5d3q8x,comment,,"I’m sorry this happened to you. It’s absolutely not your fault. Your father spent most of your life grooming you to feel like that, to act that way.

He made everything seem normal and okay. Children are so impressionable and easily coerced. That’s why there are laws in place to protect children and teens.  What you did seemed normal back then because that was his goal. At that age you had no concept of what was really being done to you. 

So, it’s unfair to judge your younger self with the adult brain you have now.  The best way forward is to work with a psychologist who specializes in helping sexual abuse and incest victims get themselves to a healthier and happier place.  

Have you told your mother?  Does she know what happened?  Can she help you get therapy? Can she help if you want to go to the police?

Please know what happened doesn’t need to define you or your future. Your dad was a monster and every single thing that happened, whether you initiated it or not, was HIS fault. Direct all your anger at him, not yourself.

# Trigger warning (description of assault): 

It involved unwanted touching and forcing me to touch his penis no matter how many times I said no. He also kept twisting and pulling my nipple and I guess the pain (me screaming) got him off. This all went on for three hours before he got bored.

I now have vaginismus and anxiety attacks whenever I'm being intimate with my partner. I cry afterwards almost every single time. I don't think I have the right to have let it affect me this much.

14775,1hthbrd,post,What do I do. My biological father peeped at me while showering.,"I(22f) am from a developing country. I am a medical student. I am completely financially dependent on my father. It started when I was a teenager. He used to kiss and hug me a lot. Which he didn't do it to my siblings a lot. Then he started groping my br3asts. I froze and I didnt know what to do at that time. After that, I started avoiding to be alone with him. I would be angry if he tried to hug me or kiss me. He would always laugh it off. I also didn't do anything about it. Because 1. I  am incredibly shy and introvert person. I was afraid and scared.2. He would never acknowledge that he sexually touched me. He would pretend he is normally hugging me. 3. Who would I tell? I was so innocent back then. I didn't even know what he is doing. Js that I was really uncomfortable. So I never confronted.4. My mom is a person that takes a lot of tension. She alr has so much going in her life. Also i was scared of her reaction.5. The most complex reason . He is an incredibly loving father. He would buy anything i want.i have a rare autoimmune condition. He pays for all of treatment,appointments.   It was limited to him trying to sexually touch me and then I always would try to never let him touch me. I thought I was fine as long as I never let him touch me and hug me. But 1 month ago, I was sleeping alone at first floor(my family was sleeping at ground floor). I felt someone trying to lift my shirt. It was him.When I started to wake up, he made something up and left.  I was so afraid. I didn't talk to him for a whole day. He came to me and started apologising and bought me anything I wanted. Basically lovebombed me. I thought okay maybe it'll never happen again. I was also so uncomfortable with this idea that my loving father tried this shit. I tried to get it out of my mind. But this weekend. My mom and whole family had to go out for 2 days to attend a wedding. My father and I were to be left alone in the house as I have exams coming up. I was afraid but I thought if I held my ground and wouldn't let him touch me and hug me and have firmer boundaries,nothing would happen. I slept in a separate room ofc. Locked the room. Now this evening,  I had to shower. We have a bathroom and a dressing room attached. And dressing room has a window that opens into a bedroom. The window was closed but if you try,you can peep. After I left the shower,I came to dressing room for 1 sec to get the towel. Call it sixth sense or whatever, I js looked at the window and became uncomfortable so I immediately went to the bathroom with the towel.(you can't see if someone is peeping or not. I js had a feeling) but then   I js knew that he was peeping. The window is next to bed and bed has plastic wrapping.if someone is on the bed, you can hear it crinkling. I heard it and immediately got goosebumps. The bedroom lights were out but I sensed he was there. I was so afraid.i wanted to cry. Js why? I am his biological daughter. Is being a man much more than being a father? Then I stood in the shower dumb for i dont know how much long. I was so afraid. I then wrapped myself with towel and dived to get my clothes in 1 sec and immediately came to shower to dress there. When I came out, he started acting like a loving father again. Preparing food for me. But I was so disgusted. I didn't say anything. Didn't let it show I knew. Pretended everything was fine and came to my room with the pretense of studying. I am gonna lock my room tonight. I am so afraid. But now I need your advice what to do. Here are the things I need to consider. Should I tell my mom? But if I tell my mom what if she tries to marry me off. She alr has this eligible bachelor for me in her mind. I dont wanna marry.  But I js know my mom would suggest exactly that and she would force me. She would take stand for me. I know that. But I don't know. What if I ruin everything. Here's another thing. I wanna go to U.S to practice medicine and as I told you I am not financially independent. My father's gonna finance all of that.  But I also know if I dont do anything about this, then matter could escalate to grape. He is so blinded by his lust. He is even preying on his daughter. I have 2 more sisters. If I remove myself from the picture(which I can't rn), I am also afraid for my sisters.(although he hasn't done anything to them). What should I do. Sorry for trauma dumping.

14795,1htiwu3,post,Coming to terms with my younger self's experiences,"Hey, guys,
This post might sound stupid and I know it will because if someone told me what I'm about to write, I would absolutely tell them that it was assault, but I really don't know how to feel about a lot of my sexual encounters as a young adult. 
The first time I was exposed to sex, I was a 14 year old freshman in highschool dating a 16 or 17 year old boy. We dated for a while and loved each other. We would often sneak out to a spot in the neighborhood to make out and touch. Well one day he told me he wanted to try intercourse. I told him I didn't want to, and he guilted me into trying to anyway. To keep it short and sweet, I was too small, and it wasn't working out. I didn't want that and was scared when it was happening and so relieved when it didn't work. I broke up with him for different reasons some months later and found out some years after that he had been telling friends and family that he broke up with me because I was trying to pressure him into sex. Talk about subconscious guilt. We were dating, so I never considered sexual acts with a partner to even be able to be labeled as non-consentual. I just thought I should have expected it since he was older.

The first time I had actual penitrative intercourse was at 16. I was working at my first job with a number of different people of all backgrounds and ages. Well, I was 16 and had a crush on a 23 year old coworker. He had just moved into town from Houston, just got out of prison, and was a total partier. Being 16, I thought the age difference was hot and complimenting of my maturity. He noticed I had a crush on him and invited me to a party. I was SO excited. At the party was my first time drinking, getting drunk, getting blackout drunk, and having penetrative sex. I remember while at the party the guy I was into left to get food. His friend was talking to me, claiming that this guy had already informed everyone that I was off limits and his that night. I thought it was so cool. Being the youngest at a party, passing the blunt with 20 year olds. This sexual relationship went on for I want to say a year. There was no emotions or relationship allowed, and it was just me being called for a hookup when he wanted it. It got to the point where he would sneak into my bedroom window at night, and we'd do it on the floor to not wake my parents. Sex from him was my 17th birthday present. I always thought of it as like an achievement. I'd talk about this relationship later in my adult years, only to be informed of the extreme power balance and manipulation. Now I know I was being taken advantage of, but I also wanted it, too? I think?

Then there was a time at a different food industry job when I was 17. I wasn't seeing the other guy anymore, and I had a really cute coworker that would flirt with me. Any sort of attention thrown at me I took in strides because I have terrible self-esteem and am shocked when people enjoy my company. This flirting progressed to photos. Then, the photos progressed to intercourse. He never actually told me his age, but I honestly thought he was around the same age because of his super young face. The first time I saw him without his hat on was at his house before we began. He was balding pretty bad up top, and red flags were going off in my head. While it was happening, I remember his skin feeling leathery and how gross it was. I later found out that he was 33. I'm now 30, and he's still the oldest person I have had intercourse with. It was traumatizing. To make it worse, apparently, his ex-wife worked there and was a manager. She called HR on me for sending photos to a co-worker and sexually shamed me publicly. And he shared those photos with our coworkers. I have only associated guilt and shame with the encounter since I was willing to have intercourse too and I sent those photos. But I had no idea of his age or relationship.
These were my first experiences with sexual relations, and I never thought too much about them until recently. I was just thrown around as an idolized fetish doll amongst perverts. It's still hard for me to conceptualize that all of these instances are SA. But maybe it was less consensual than I thought. 
I'd like to know as an outsider reading this, if this is actual SA or if I'm just as much at blame and am just trying to feel better about myself? ","Coming to terms with my younger self's experiences Hey, guys,

14814,1htki3x,post,traumatic or i’m dramatic?,"traumatic? or dramatic 

so about 2 years ago i posted a post on this, i’m going the paste it:

so i 14F had sex with a 22M 3 times during the summer. i met him on tinder and not even 24 hours knowing each other,I lost my virginity to him. when me and him did it the first time i brought a condom and put it on him and he said that it “hurt” and that the sex is going to be bad. i asked him if we’re going to use it and he said i don’t really want so i felt pressured to let him do it without it. when i went down on him it kinda smelled musty where his stomach is. my stomach was hurting very bad so i asked him to take a break, he said he’s almost close to cumming so he kept going without stopping. he was not close at all my stomach ended up hurting the whole day so i took aleve. he didn’t know he took my virginity and he thought i was 18. 


 the next day me and him had sex again and my stomach still hurt but i took aleve again before and after. 

2 weeks later when we had sex while i was on my period- the first day and after my vigina was sore after. mind you all 3 times we had sex in his car. i didn’t really want to do it but he kept begging me on text and i felt obligated to meet up with him. when we did it while i was on my period he nutted kinda close to my vigina and i asked him if it got on it since it got on both inner thighs. he said that i’m on my period and that i’m fine. i told him i can get pregnant on my period. and he continued to say i was fine and brushed it off.when i got back to my friend’s house and i wipped and stuck my fingers down there i saw this googy blood that reminded me of when i’m ovulating. my period continued and everything was fine. i’m not pregnant since i did get my period again last month. 

yesterday i went to the doctors because ever since me and him had sex while i was on my period, i had weird symptoms. i have trich and i told him that i have it. should i tell him that im not 18? i can’t get it out of my head and i really want to but im scared. also he cut me off like a month ago since i asked him if he could wear a condom next time we did it but he latched out on me and got mad. he still texts me now and then and today he texted me so i just told him that he gave me trich. me and him also had unprotected sex all 3 times. i do have antibiotics i have to take for 7 days twice a day. before you ask yes my parents are very angry and highly disappointed with me but i didn’t tell them i had sex with someone older nor did i tell them i actually had vaginal sex and i probably won’t until i get older. 

he doesn’t know where i live but he could find out since he knows the city. me and him actually live in the same city but he’s like 10 mins away from me. he is kind of creepy since he found my instagram without me telling him it. if i don’t answer him he will text me multiple times. even after him “cutting me off” he still texts me now and then as i’ve stated. he’ll text me like once a week. he has harassed me before through calling me multiple times and texting me on snap after i don’t answer on messenges. now he unadded me on snap and i’ve unadded him but he still texts me. he would beg me to have sex with him and meet up with him. he also took a video of us together after we did it the first time. he took a video of me giving him head even though he says he didn’t i know he did since he was on his phone while i was doing it. he also told me he took a video of me walking after he dropped me off at the library we met at.

help me plz give me ideas to tell the man my real age i can’t live thinking i never told him. he is also a preschool teacher so i feel so bad and fucked up.


so i’m 16 now and this happened july of 2022. back in june of 2023 i told him i was 14 when we had sex and that he took my virginity and he still wanted to have sex with me again. no i didn’t have sex with him i haven’t done anything sexual since we last had sex in 2022. i haven’t talked to him since june of 2023 and ive told my parents. they don’t know he was grown but they know about the sexual  assault? part. i told my mom and she honestly just said it was my fault which ig is understandable. 



my question now is  what would this be considered? when me and this guy had sex back in 2022, i told him it hurts and i was saying ow the whole time. i told him i wanted to take a break and he just flipped me over and asked “is this better?” i said no it still really hurt and he just told me “it’s fine i’m close to cumming”. the second time me and this guy had sex he choked me during sex. we never talked about that so i felt violated as a person since 1 i barely knew him and 2 i genuinely thought he was abt to kill me since he was doing it so hard. the third time we had sex he made me say things i wasn’t comfortable with saying and even though i would be quiet when he told me to
say things he would just keep pushing it until i said it. the first time we had sex, when he didn’t stop when i told him to stop is that considered sexual assault or rape? i genuinely just need closure abt this situation since it changed me for the worse and idk if im being dramatic or not. 


i hated myself so much for over a year after this happened to the point where i had an eating disorder and i couldn’t even look at myself in the mirror bc i hated what i saw sm. ever since that happened i struggle with saying no to people to the point where i never can say no. i have a really hard time trusting guys that come into my life who try to pursue me since im scared if we have sex they wont stop if i want them to or they’ll make me do stuff im not comfortable with. i’ve talked to a lot of guys after that happened but i could never commit. i’m talking to a guy rn and he treats me better then any guy has and i genuinely feel that im too much for him. i wanna tell him abt this situation since it genuinely fucked me up for the worse but i’m scared im just being dramatic or he’s gonna look at me completely different. please someone tell me, am i being dramatic or was this genuinely a traumatizing experience?

i’m sorry for any spelling mistakes and and repeated things it’s not allowing me to edit.","traumatic or i’m dramatic? traumatic? or dramatic 

so about 2 years ago i posted a post on this, i’m going the paste it:

so i 14F had sex with a 22M 3 times during the summer. i met him on tinder and not even 24 hours knowing each other,I lost my virginity to him. when me and him did it the first time i brought a condom and put it on him and he said that it “hurt” and that the sex is going to be bad. i asked him if we’re going to use it and he said i don’t really want so i felt pressured to let him do it without it. when i went down on him it kinda smelled musty where his stomach is. my stomach was hurting very bad so i asked him to take a break, he said he’s almost close to cumming so he kept going without stopping. he was not close at all my stomach ended up hurting the whole day so i took aleve. he didn’t know he took my virginity and he thought i was 18. 


 the next day me and him had sex again and my stomach still hurt but i took aleve again before and after.

14829,1htme03,post,I need help,"I’m not sure if this is exactly where I go considering this isn’t bad compared to most 🥲

I just really need to ask a question mainly and get advice or insight because I’ve been confused on this my whole life 18(F) now.


I’ve had dreams of being raped like about four times now. The first two times I was in about 2nd grade, I can’t remember specific details while the act ensued but I do remember the people in it and stuff before it happened. 
1st one was my mothers friend, we were in a gas station I think. My favorite superhero at the time was Superman and my mothers friend for some odd reason was dressed as him..? I have no recollection to details after this besides the fact he raped me. 
2nd one was my school crush at the time, we were in school. The school for some reason was in ruins or burning. I was in the back of a classroom after having tried running and there was a table dropped along more debris so the only way out was a small gap forward. My crush at the time along with what seemed to be an adult was with him and then he proceeded to rape me while the adult watched. I had no idea what was happening at that age, just that I was terrified and saying no. I avoided the poor guy like the plague after because of how scared I was.

I’d like to add in that I figured out at 16 my mothers friend had raped her at some point. 

Growing up I had two more dreams but my mind basically blanks the whole thing. One I remember was a character on social media that I had a hyper fixation on at the time which immediately caused it to stop. The other I remember next to nothing and it was just a blank face, all I can remember was that the act did happen. I’ve labeled myself as asexual throughout most of my life because I hate people touching me, I freak out when my family does usually. I presume the reason why this is, is because my brother used to flip me over when we were young and repeatedly spank me for no reason. I don’t know if this would be considered SA or not but I always felt grossed out and horrible afterwards even if he found this as “playing”, I told him to stop in multiple occasions. My mom stood up for him and said it was just playing. It took me years to go to her and it was because he slapped my ass as a joke in a store and I freaked out. She also told me he had said “he liked butts” at the time, which makes me even more uncomfortable and confused why she stood up for him. 
I don’t remember too much of my childhood but I think the whole brother thing was after the first 2 dreams or around them. ","I need help I’m not sure if this is exactly where I go considering this isn’t bad compared to most 🥲

14831,1htn0u3,post,Trying to figure out ethics of a hookup I was involved in,"This is in a way a follow up to a post I made directly after it happened. 

I (M17) ended up having sex with someone (F27) I had been drinking with at a music festival in September. Long story short I consented the night of thinking I was sober, but over the next day realized how gross I felt and that I definitely would not have done that if I wasn’t drinking. I’ve been really guilty about it because I clearly said yes during the encounter, but Im starting to think I couldn’t consent properly. Eventually i decided to tell my friend about it (I only had one so I was nervous talking about it out of fear of it ruining our friendship) and she told me it was slightly creepy but not sa or grooming because the age of consent here is 16, I didn’t know that (my sex ed teacher always told us it was 18). I can’t remember if I was really sober or not, all I know is I definitely wouldn’t do it now, but I dint know if I, just having regrets or if I genuinely couldn’t consent. So I’m really confused on what to think, if I’m of legal age and I consented it wasn’t rape, so why do I feel so gross and used?

Not really expecting anyone to respond but if you have any insight that would be greatly appreciated, I genuinely don’t know where else to ask, I don’t have any friends and my parents have enough on their plate.

When we were in the elevator, he stood over me and started kissing me. We got to the hotel room and things started getting heated and we were making out. Then, clothes were off and his hands were all over me then his head was between my legs and things were good. Then, like, suddenly, I got overstimulated and started to cry. He stopped and backed off. We talked for a minute and he comforted me for a second. Then, I was like ""can we just make out for a minute?

We talked for a minute and he comforted me for a second. Then, I was like ""can we just make out for a minute? I think I got overstimulated."" and he said ""yeah"" so we started kissing again and within a minute his hand was between my legs touching me. I kind of froze up because I wasn't prepared to go back to doing this. V and I ended up having sex. And I started crying DURING sex. He did stop but within a minute he was trying to start again. So, I jsut, kind of. Fell out of my body? Like, I wasn't there but I was? !<



>!I think I'm just wondering if this is considered SA or if I should just, like, shut up and stop exaggerating? My sisters think it is but it doesn't feel like SAs I've experienced when I was smaller because at least then I said ""no"" and cried for them to stop. I didn't do that this time.!<",2,1.0,2025-01-04 20:30,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1htnle1/i_think_im_overreacting/,Neutral

I was very vulnerable as a child which led me to say yes to everything that was asked of me. My cousin would ask me to go to his parents room and would close the door. Once we were alone he would lift my shirt up and rub my nipples and slide his hands down my pants to rub my thighs, sometimes passing them in the leg holes of my underwear and ask if i liked it.

About a few months ago I was sexually assaulted by a family friend and it was really traumatic to the point I broke up with my partner bc the thought of anything sexual broke me and I have felt sick since. I haven’t told my family as it’s embarrassing as the person who did it is well known to the family and I just felt lost. 

This is where it gets bad though and need desperate support. I have recently started masterbating to the thought of this man r@ping me and I fucking hate it because I don’t want it but I can’t help it. I have had strong fantasies about him since the incident and I don’t know who to reach out to for help

This guy who SA me has a girlfriend however has texted me since saying that he masterbates over me and that he wants to have sex and since breaking up with my partner a part of me wants to go see him and do stuff. However I know I can’t 

A bit of context of what happened a couple months ago is that I went over there because he’s a family friend and I was heart broken about the fact that I was thinking about breaking up with my partner and he said;

“We need to feel comfortable so you can tell me everything” and then he lifted up my shirt and felt my boobs and said “you are becoming a proper lady now”

For context I’m 17 and he’s 25 and he’s known me since I was 14/15 and he said that he had always though I had a great ass 

Carrying on:

I made it very clear I felt comfortable enough without needing to show my body and he got really defensive and annoyed and he said “why don’t you feel comfortable around me?!” So I pulled down my shirt and then he lifted it back up and moved my bra down and started touching and I said again I didn’t feel comfortable 

I moved away and changed the topic and pretended to start crying in the hope he would stop and then he got worse

He told me to pull down my pants and I said no then he pulled down his pants reveal g his penis and I said for him to put it back and he said that we need to both feel comfortable (idk what he means by that anymore-) and he was trying to take my pants down and I said no lots and I wasn’t comfortable so he pulled down my fly and started rubbing my down below while masterbating and he wanted to go further however I lied and said my mum wanted me back home immediately and luckily he let me go 

He did say he would of definitely done more if he had a partner and been texting me almost every day since saying that he wants to fuck me and saying he has the house to his self and sending videos of him cumming when I ask him not to 

However the other week when I actually broke up with my partner I was very vulnerable and stupid and he begged more “naughty photos” and I sent a photo on Snapchat as a one time viewing of a photo of me in my bra (still with jeans on) and he saved it and he admits that he looks at that more then his partners photos 

I need help coping as I’m very vulnerable at the moment due to other factors in life so I’m afraid that my lust towards him will grow and I will end up doing stuff out of stupidity 

I also want to know why I’m having these feelings because I have had not even a slight bit of feelings before hand towards him it was just since that night…

14921,1htvovi,post,Testifying,"I was SA early this month. I posted about it anonymously in a local group. I was contacted by two women, one being his baby mama and the other her best friend.

They got the information out of me by acting supportive and sharing stories of what he’s done to them.

The best friend told me not to go to the police because no one would believe me.

I went to the hospital with complications within 72 hours and stayed there almost 48 hours.

The hospital called the police and then I sat in interrogation for five hours.

I gave all my evidence over to the police. He was arrested.

They got the information out of me by acting supportive and sharing stories of what he’s done to them.

The best friend told me not to go to the police because no one would believe me.

I went to the hospital with complications within 72 hours and stayed there almost 48 hours.

The hospital called the police and then I sat in interrogation for five hours.

I gave all my evidence over to the police. He was arrested.

14937,1htwx1g,post,i dont know what to title this sorry-,"hi!! i'll put this before so no one gets surprised

this is my first time using reddit, so i apologize if anything is weird/wrong.

heres some base context: though born a female, i now use they/them pronouns. despite this, i have ALWAYS been into women, since kindergarten. so basically i was gay my whole life! i also use humor to cope, so some of this may sound really silly and not serious at all. i apologize, im trying not to think about the tears shed with (Lexi). thanks for understanding!!

TW. mentions of SA, SA with minors/REALLY young children, m@sturbat1on, cheating, lesbianism, and awful spelling (no autocorrect+fast typing)

TL;DR: i dont know whether to classify this as sexual assault?? ive always been attention seeking, so being peer pressured into kidsing someone (therefore cheating on current gf) doesnt count as SA, right? it was at a decelopmental period in my life and brought freat trauma so... 😵‍💫 (i just dont want to be an attention seeker and i an asking for assistance so i dont say this to my friends and have them continuously be careful with me!)
contains a little more too!!

okayyy full story:

as a young kid, maybe between 3-5, i did something i called ""my thing"". i would spread my legs, essentially looking like a frog, then touch myself. i always got told off, but it felt good, and nobody explained to me why it was ""wrong"", so i kept doing it. over and over and over. this lasted until i was about 7, when i met this girl (we'll call her Lexi, for her privacy). Lexi and i became great friends, and, as any kid our age would do, i invited her over to my house for a playdate. she happily agreed. nearing the end of our playdate, she confessed she ""had feelings for me"". i explained that i was walready in a relationship, so i didnt really feel the same way.

then, trying to convince me to kiss her for whatever reason, she said this: ""Sometimes, you just need ti leave people behind. Forget about (name, lets call her F), its not cheating if you say it out loud now."" (F wasnt around to hear this at the time!!) as i had anxiety and avoided confrontation, i cautiously agreed, my palms sweaty and my brain turning at 2,000 mph. i was shocked, anxious, and extremely worried. she kissed me on the lips, and i accepted that this was how it would be. 

she left immediately after the kiss. fast forward to the next day, she sent me an odd text. since we had a self defense class together soon, i was curious why she would text so soon. 

LMAO SHE LITERALLY SENT ME MARSHMALLOW SONG CALLED ""FRIENDZKNED"". HELP?? 

anyways i was confused, and we had an argument over it. she didnt like me, and i felt that my whole life was truned over. like she made me leave my gf so i was hers and then immediately broke up??? what??? turns out she was into boys the whole time 😋 i held back tears at that moment, though. panic flared- imagine my parents foind out! i couldnt go to class later but i couldnt cry my way out. instead, i (thankfully) had a very painful foot injury and used that to my advantage, quitting classes in general. 

flash forward a couple years. my extebded family and i are out at dinner, and (somehow sob) the word ""cum"" gets said. as a curious ~10 yr old, i asked my parents. i didnt understand what they said. looking it up, i found some ""corn"" websites. very addictinf to a 10 year old. got sucked in for a very, very long time, trying to get myself to the same point as the girls in the videos, if you know what i mean. it was kind of an addiction- a bad one.

but, nonetheless, i didnt stop it. my parents didnt know i did it anymore, and assumed i had no idea what any reproduction or s3x websites or toys or videos were. so- just me and my s3x addiction.

now im wondering if this was a trauma response?? idk im so confused 😭😭😭 if anyone could help in small detail, it'd be helpful! ty for readjng and have a great day :)

quick edit since i got a dm about this (i ignored i dont want to have the possibility of talking to creeps sorry :/): 

i am still under 15 years old. i have tried to have sex multiple times with my current gf (Iz). we both ""consented"", but this shouldnt be happening. 
i am extremely hupersexual and cant last a day without orgasming. this isnt healthy and i dont know how to stop it. 

Lexi forced herself onto me, i didnt want it. i didnt want to kiss her and it has caused me a lot of issues today, with ""trauma"" meddling my feelings with everything, even though it was such a small thing. 

even if this isnt sexual assault, please, i just want to know how to stop this-or at least minimilize this. i dont like doing it and it makes my depression worse every time i do.

14953,1hty0oc,post,need a second opinion about something?,"First of all, I know this community is for sexual assault, I wouldn’t go as far to say what has happened has been sexual assault. Something has happened today and the post I’m making, I’m not sure where to post it but here seems like a good place. 

My dad has made me feel uncomfortable today. 

For a while now, I’ve had this strange gut feeling about him. I’ve felt like he might be secretly into me and that he has thoughts about me. 

As far as I know, he has never done anything bad to me, ( I know people can block out memories, but i remember so much of my childhood, so I’m 99% sure I’d remember if something bad occurred ). I like my dad, I think if my gut feeling is true, he’d never act on it. He’s a pretty decent person. 

It’s just Whenever he gets drunk, he always says over and over about how beautiful he thinks I am. He never says anything like this when he’s sober. This is what sets my uncomfortable gut feeling off the most, because I’m afraid that because he’s drunk he will start admitting things. One time when he was drunk he was talking to me and my mum and he said something about fantasising about the two of us, he didn’t say what he meant by fantasied though. I get really really nervous aswell because I’m scared he will slip up and admit it infront of my mum too. I think that makes me so nervous is because I don’t want anyone to know about this, hence why I’m on a new account and I’m not going to tell anyone irl. 

Anyway, ahout what happened today…. So he and my mum went out drinking. He came back, not like really drunk, but drunk. For some stupid reason, I decided to go downstairs and see the two of them, despite me having this horrible gut feeling flaring up. He started going on about how good looking I was again, but this time he also started grabbing my wrists. He’s never done this before, not drunk or sober. I didn’t like this at all. He carried on doing it a few more times, then later on I sat down and he started tapping on my leg too, another time he doesn’t do neither drunk or sober. The whole thing just made me feel so uncomfortable and nervous, my mouth went all dry, I felt sick in my tummy and I couldn’t even look him in the eye. 

I’m posting this because I’d like a second opinion or maybe just some advice from someone who has expirienced something similar? Also just need to get this off of my chest, in a way that wouldn’t ruin my dad’s reputation if I really am just making all this up in my head…","need a second opinion about something?

14971,1hu0b41,post,I need help,"Its been going on for years, and i cant stop going back to it. I dont know how to label myself and im sk sick of it. The first time i was exploited was when i was in 4th grade, but it was by a 5th grader so i dont think it counts. He made me touch his chest and grind myself against him under a blanket in our babysitters basement (we werent related) and then made me do it to another boy. My main issue was starting when i was in 5th grade i started being more sexual. I got boobs really early, and at 11 i was sitting at a DD. I have an hourglass body with a bit of tummy, as i always have, and in 6th grade when boys started to really notice my figure, the pandemic hit. And i loved that validation, so like many others during covid, i went to omegle. Now i dont know what to call it. I wrote a poem summarizing the past 5 years so i thought id share it to anyone who wants to read it. last night i went on an omegle alternative in a fight to feel something before i killed myself to validate it. (I am fine, nothing happened and i am completely safe i received help from a friend). But it went the same as it always did. I got ready, and i sat in front of my camera, and i waited, and i kept fucking myself for people. Grown men usually from 24-60. Once they found out i was 10-13 “my prime years of camgirling” they would make it so much worse. Asking me stuff like “you love older men” “youre such a good slut for daddy, bet your father wants to rape you” stuff like that. I cant do anything now, i was doxxed and one of these men live two witht .2 miles of me god knows how many more of them, i cant go to the police or anyone i know because theres no real evidence of it and i feel like i pursued it so it wouldnt be valid, and i dont know if i was groomed or assaulted or what to do and im just so tired. Im so fucking tired. Ill put the poem at the end of the post




Confession

From the time I was ten years old,
I sinned.
I can remember the look in their faces,
The thick accents,
The camera angles,
The very trick I used to avoid moderators.

I would listen to the grunting,
The praise for my youth
And how “all girls should be like you”

To use the term juvenile whore
Would be an understatement
Because i can't remember,
Just how many men there were.
22 into their late 50s
But i remember the feeling

I remember how I felt the first time.
When i didn't know my breasts could be tender,
When i didn't know what “pleasure” felt like
When i showed a man my body,
And i didnt want to.

Then it became habit. 
I would log on every chance i got.
And i would flaunt myself for perverted men
Who craved a youthful girl
Too innocent to know what a cock was
So pure as to ask what sex is.

But i knew.
I knew the sickness i felt every god damn time
I know the guilt i feel now,
And the way it affects me today.
Because it was my fault.
I would lie, and then flaunt
I would sin, and then claw myself to pieces
All for a man i didnt know

Because theres many factors to the aftermath
I wont call it trauma,
Because i never tried to stop it

I wont call it grooming,
Because i pursued it

I wont call it manipulation
Because I deserved it
My skin, deserved it,
All of the cuts.

And to this day i reminisce,
Seeping through nightmares about these devils
Seeking sexual validation 
From anyone i see

I cant look at my body anymore,
I just cant.

I am disgusting, 
I wont take care of myself
So that NOBODY
Will ever look at me like that again
But i know, if any of them asked
I would do it over and over again.

In the aftermath now,
When i watch the blood drip onto my hands
The same ones i used to fuck myself
For another’s  gain.
I think of them.

I think of them when i shower,
And i'm forced to see my body
And i imagine what it looks like through a lens
Maybe it made me look more attractive
Maybe my age made me more attractive.

Now when i experience that “ecstasy”
I perceive it as a gift,
To someone else
When i am bedded It is not for me.
It was never, For me.

I cant look at a man the same way
Im worried everyone will want me the same way
Im worried ill be touched
In every street corner and alley
I wont stand on the buses, 
because what if someone sees my ass from the seat

I fantasize about parking lots,
Late night walks,
Concerts and movies
Where i am groped

And raped
And destroyed

Devouring chunks of my fingers, my wrist,

","I need help Its been going on for years, and i cant stop going back to it. I dont know how to label myself and im sk sick of it. The first time i was exploited was when i was in 4th grade, but it was by a 5th grader so i dont think it counts. He made me touch his chest and grind myself against him under a blanket in our babysitters basement (we werent related) and then made me do it to another boy. My main issue was starting when i was in 5th grade i started being more sexual. I got boobs really early, and at 11 i was sitting at a DD. I have an hourglass body with a bit of tummy, as i always have, and in 6th grade when boys started to really notice my figure, the pandemic hit. And i loved that validation, so like many others during covid, i went to omegle. Now i dont know what to call it. I wrote a poem summarizing the past 5 years so i thought id share it to anyone who wants to read it. last night i went on an omegle alternative in a fight to feel something before i killed myself to validate it. (I am fine, nothing happened and i am completely safe i received help from a friend). But it went the same as it always did. I got ready, and i sat in front of my camera, and i waited, and i kept fucking myself for people. Grown men usually from 24-60. Once they found out i was 10-13 “my prime years of camgirling” they would make it so much worse. Asking me stuff like “you love older men” “youre such a good slut for daddy, bet your father wants to rape you” stuff like that. I cant do anything now, i was doxxed and one of these men live two witht .2 miles of me god knows how many more of them, i cant go to the police or anyone i know because theres no real evidence of it and i feel like i pursued it so it wouldnt be valid, and i dont know if i was groomed or assaulted or what to do and im just so tired. Im so fucking tired. Ill put the poem at the end of the post




Confession

From the time I was ten years old,
I sinned.
I can remember the look in their faces,
The thick accents,
The camera angles,
The very trick I used to avoid moderators.

I would listen to the grunting,
The praise for my youth
And how “all girls should be like you”

To use the term juvenile whore
Would be an understatement
Because i can't remember,
Just how many men there were.
22 into their late 50s
But i remember the feeling

I remember how I felt the first time.
When i didn't know my breasts could be tender,
When i didn't know what “pleasure” felt like
When i showed a man my body,
And i didnt want to.

Then it became habit. 
I would log on every chance i got.
And i would flaunt myself for perverted men
Who craved a youthful girl
Too innocent to know what a cock was
So pure as to ask what sex is.

But i knew.
I knew the sickness i felt every god damn time
I know the guilt i feel now,
And the way it affects me today.
Because it was my fault.
I would lie, and then flaunt
I would sin, and then claw myself to pieces
All for a man i didnt know

Because theres many factors to the aftermath
I wont call it trauma,
Because i never tried to stop it

I wont call it grooming,
Because i pursued it

I wont call it manipulation
Because I deserved it
My skin, deserved it,
All of the cuts.

And to this day i reminisce,
Seeping through nightmares about these devils
Seeking sexual validation 
From anyone i see

I cant look at my body anymore,
I just cant.

I am disgusting, 
I wont take care of myself
So that NOBODY
Will ever look at me like that again
But i know, if any of them asked
I would do it over and over again.

In the aftermath now,
When i watch the blood drip onto my hands
The same ones i used to fuck myself
For another’s  gain.
I think of them.

I think of them when i shower,
And i'm forced to see my body
And i imagine what it looks like through a lens
Maybe it made me look more attractive
Maybe my age made me more attractive.

Now when i experience that “ecstasy”
I perceive it as a gift,
To someone else
When i am bedded It is not for me.
It was never, For me.

I cant look at a man the same way
Im worried everyone will want me the same way
Im worried ill be touched
In every street corner and alley
I wont stand on the buses, 
because what if someone sees my ass from the seat

I fantasize about parking lots,
Late night walks,
Concerts and movies
Where i am groped
And ground
And raped
And destroyed
All because if it happened online its not bad.

Most of all though,
I fantasize of the hurt i can bring my own body.
Devouring chunks of my fingers, my wrist,
Trying to make it disappear.

I, want to disappear.

It’s been almost 10 years since I was assaulted at a party…a friend (one of my only friends I confided in about the assault) took her life a few months ago and I went into a hypomanic episode afterwards. I started hooking up with strangers and it’s escalated to attending sex parties and participating in gang bangs….I don’t do it for any sort of pleasure but it feels like I’m just trying to be in control, like I’m letting my body be used but I’m choosing to do it this time. I always tell every partner they just need to put a condom on and there’s been several guys that don’t put it on and I don’t notice because I’m just kind of dissociated the whole time. After they finish I see that they never put the condom on and I panic internally but then tell them it’s fine as long as they pulled out before finishing because I can’t do anything about it after the fact. I guess I just feel conflicted because I’m choosing to put myself in this room full of strangers who are there just for sex but there’s also consent rules in place…","Putting myself in dangerous situations on purpose TW

but he gave me drugs... the second time we met. first time was for coffee but we didnt actually fuck. anyways... one time, while rly high i told him to slow down and he did for a few seconds. i told him again, and he did the same thing and after that i let him keep going despite how it hurt. i dont recall anything after that except the pain i felt sometime afterwards. 10000000 times worse than cramps bcus i could even roll to the side on my bed similar to japanese futon beds that lay on the floor. i couldnt move for 3 days because of him. bur yknow i... even now idk what to think of it. there were a few times when it hurt but i didnt think my pain mattered due to other traumas. nothing i felt ever mattered and even tho he said it did or acted like it did, it still didnt to me. 

despite this why do i miss him? we havent talked since i was 17 cuz of shit that happened and I had to move 12 hrs away. but yknow he made me feel better both emotionally and... sadly, sexually. he made me feel good. i miss it. if i could i'd meet him again but i cant unless he wants to fly to me which he wont. 

LMAO pretty sure he also tried sex trafficking me bcus he talked to me about fucking other men for money even after finding out i was 17. what in the fucking fuck is wrong with me? im so stupid...

I’m now seeing someone, they are aware of everything and it’s all going great. 



I have found that I ‘need’ sex to feel whole. I feel disconnected with my body, and when I have sex it goes away. When we go a while without having sex, I feel that disconnect grow.

15015,1hu5ws2,post,Two months since I started to make terms with it. It gets better. ,"My assault happened July 28th of last year. My bf at the time and I went on vacation to Philadelphia. The first night we were there, he took the condom off and tried to hide it from me and said he raped me when I was unsure of what to say or do, stuck in shock. Long story short, I stayed, he assaulted me a few more times by having sex with me while I was very much drunk anywhere around 3-5 times. Anyways, he broke up with me two months ago. When he left, I finally started processing the assaults and it was incredibly hard. Sometimes, I find myself missing the good parts of the relationship. I wanted to post because I’ve been having a good few days that makes me pretty hopeful of my recovery. I’m strong and so is everyone on here. I wasn’t dumped, I was freed. I find myself excited to one day say it’s been three months since this person left and so on. I find myself excited at times that he’s gone and I don’t have to pretend anymore. I’m excited to one day fall in love with someone who respects me and my boundaries and treats me kindly. I feel like I was pretty good as a partner to this person and I know he’s missing out, losing me. I’ve noticed a trauma response of mine where I feel like I need to move around constantly to avoid thinking. I’m learning to be okay in sitting in the discomfort, the silence is okay. I feel like I don’t find him attractive physically anymore now that his personality has sort of finally revealed itself to me. He was super cruel and mean after the breakup, even when I went to the mental hospital, and when I cut myself. He had blocked me for saying something mean the day I cut myself. He lacks self awareness. He’s a total asshole. I’m learning to be glad he left. Recently, I decided to forgive him and not go the legal route and for me, it felt liberating. I ended up washing three sweaters that still smelled like him and spraying them with my perfume. It felt symbolic idk. I look back and I don’t really know who my ex was. We were together for 7 months and the assault that happened on our trip happened 4 months in. It’s been almost 5 months since it happened and I’ve found a support group, a therapist, supportive friends. Not a single one of my friends felt bad for me when I got broken up with. They all felt so excited for me bc none of them liked this ex bc of what he did to me. There was some other emotionally abusive things, but it’s all on some of my earlier posts. Anyways, it’s been 2 months since I started to accept that what happened to me was rape and stopped lying to myself that it was okay. I’ve been allowing myself to feel the bad emotions, as painful as they may be. I’ve considered giving up and dying at points, but I’m proud of myself for getting out of that and out of the relationship. I feel proud of my progress and I hope that this serves as a source of good for someone else, that it’s incredibly hard, but it does get better, little by little. Learning to check in with my emotions and understanding why I’m feeling some sort of way has helped me with my mindfulness. I’m grateful for this subreddit for helping me with some of the most vulnerable stuff. I want to believe that I’m a good person that cares deeply for others, even those that have wronged me. I think there will always be a part of me that cares for this ex, even years down the road, and will always wish him the best. I’m sure he doesn’t feel the same for me, but I know that what I felt for him was real. The idea of reaching out to him gives me anxiety too. It’s kind of nice though that it feels stressful, the idea of talking to him. It’s helped me keep my distance. I hit rough patches at times where I do send a message, but I’m learning to give myself grace. Healing is a hard journey and little by little, I’m starting to miss him less. I don’t want to hate myself anymore. I’m tired of hating myself for messaging him at points, but I’m proud that I’m free now. ","Two months since I started to make terms with it. It gets better.

They had a kid who was one year older than me and introduced me to porn. I’m pretty sure he learned this from his dad because I’d catch his dad watching porn. The kid would often make me watch porn with him and would be angry if I didn’t wanna watch so I’d just watch and soon enough I got addicted too. He used to show his privates to people on websites like Omegle, and they would too. And soon enough it occurred to us having sex. I was reluctant to. But he would put me in different positions in different rooms. And eventually so, someone caught us. But they never told my dad. Now I have an addiction to self pleasure and watching explicit videos.

After experiencing trauma, *especially* sexual trauma, it’s super common to feel a disconnect from your body and seek ways to reclaim a sense of control or connection—and for you, that might manifest through sex.

I think therapy, especially with someone who specializes in trauma, could really be helpful. I would like to see you be able to feel whole without having to have sex. Let’s say that something happens to your partner and they are unable to have sex with you for whatever reason - maybe ED, maybe an accident - who knows right?

Spice level: probably more like ""sweet spice""/3.5 or 4 since the focus is more on emotions, but there are some physical descriptions within reason, and hopefully it's clear as to why. Not exploitative or porny.  
I just hope this intimacy scene between the two of them is sensitive enough and that it addresses different things well enough. I've my own opinions as an SA survivor, but I'd also appreciate the thoughts of others, as we're not all a monolith.

Which do you guys, as survivors, prefer? FTB or open door with a focus on emotions (and some lenient physicality)?  
Normally, if I write a romantic subplot in my spec fic, I keep it FTB bc I personally don't view on-page sex as necessary in most stories, but in the case of characters with SA trauma, I feel it is necessary to navigate on-page. They do fondle/grope each other in tender ways, but the exploration is more in tune with working through triggers, emotional hurt, and also...just plain giving themselves and each other the permission to feel pleasure bc they've never been able to/were allowed to before. I thought it important to have a representation of love-based, safe, and positive sex as opposed to the filth they went through before with their abusers. They also give each other many opportunities to back out any time if they want to (bc they are allowed autonomy whereas their abusers didn't allow it and they aren't made to feel bad for saying ""no""), and there are reassurances throughout, along with questions like ""is this okay?""/""does this feel good?""/""do you like this?"" etc.  
Anyway, I'm sure I have a lot of editing to do--even more than I have already--with it. Especially the dialogue as some of it probably appears a tad wooden, which I could use some help with there.

15057,1hub0em,post,Was this SA?,"I am M17, girl is F17, gf is F18. We are in the UK, all above the age of consent.

This all happened around a year ago with a girl I'm still sort of friends with, recently I told my girlfriend (\~1 month) about it and it made her cry and I began to evaluate whether I've been brushing this off.

June 2023 me and this girl (I'll call her Δ) nearly go on a date but she cancels and says she's not ready, really she means she doesn't want to date me but thats okay. I'm a little upset but I get over it and move past it.

September 2023, at a party we both get drunk and she kisses me (I reciprocate) and we go somewhere private where she asks if she can give me a handjob but i decline as we're at a party with all our friends.  
Later this month we attend another party where she tries to take me to the host's bedroom despite me saying I didn't think it was a good idea, so I text the host and ask him to occupy his room. At the end of the night me and some friends go to Δ's house to sleepover. She takes me upstairs and asks to see my dick, I decline, she then asks me to touch her boobs and I do for a bit before going to sleep. I should say we are both somewhat drunk the whole night.

October 2023, this is what my girlfriend is most upset over but I am hesitant to be drastic about it given the history up to this point. We're both at a party and yet again drunk, she takes me to sit on the stairs with her and asks me to touch her boobs. I say no as I'm worried about consent and us being drunk, she asks again and I say no 2-3 more times until finally relenting and agreeing to. She places a hand on my crotch but I'm not erect, I don't tell her to stop but I'm not really enjoying it. I know i was drunk but in hindsight nobody saw her drink very much that night and so it is quite up in the air.

Over the next year nothing really happens, she does however have a record of refusing to talk about important things between us (including the aforementioned) until I am / we are drunk

October 2024 At a party I am incredibly drunk and we are sat talking outside, she takes me to sit on the stairs (same ones as October 2023) but then my other friend sees and comes sits with us. Nothing happens.

December 2024 Since me and my gf started dating I put a bit of distance between me and Δ. She was confused why I was ignoring her (that is fair) and texted me, I tried to explain myself but the convo went nowhere. I offered to talk about it in person as I am bad at texting conversations, she ignores the message and so we stop talking. I am fine with this.

New Years Eve 24/25, I am yet again very very drunk (it is a party at my house though, my gf is there). At one point in the night she takes me outside and starts having at a go at me for not talking to her, I am farrrr too drunk to talk about this so i start singing karma police by radiohead and then clumsily stumble indoors. My gf says she thinks its weird she tried to get me alone to shout at me when very drunk.

January 2025 I tell my gf about all this and she cries telling me she is uncomfortable with her being around (understandable) but she is upset and crying because she is worried for me and my safety (i am not worried for my safety but i see her pov)

Unsure if this is SA or harassment or just plain weird. Any questions please let me know.","Was this SA? I am M17, girl is F17, gf is F18. We are in the UK, all above the age of consent.

This all happened around a year ago with a girl I'm still sort of friends with, recently I told my girlfriend (\~1 month) about it and it made her cry and I began to evaluate whether I've been brushing this off.

June 2023 me and this girl (I'll call her Δ) nearly go on a date but she cancels and says she's not ready, really she means she doesn't want to date me but thats okay. I'm a little upset but I get over it and move past it.

September 2023, at a party we both get drunk and she kisses me (I reciprocate) and we go somewhere private where she asks if she can give me a handjob but i decline as we're at a party with all our friends.

A few months ago I was SA'd by a colleague. We'd gone out drinking in a large group and when I left to go home he followed me out and redirected me to walking to his house. I wasn't sober and while I dont remember the walk to his house I remember saying multiple times that I wanted to go home to my house, alone. 

I only remember bits and pieces after getting to his house. I'm not sure if he used a condom, I did get STI tested, all negative thankfully. I know that we had sex but I never wanted to be there. I never wanted to have sex with him. Im not trying to fill in the blanks. Right now I'm fine with the memory gaps. 

I'm mad at myself. I'm mad for letting my guard down and inviting a new person to come hang out with my friends. I'm mad for allowing him to walk me to his house. I'm mad for how broken I feel everyday. I'm mad at how it's effected my relationship with my partner (who has been incredibly supportive and patient in the aftermath) and I'm mad that I'm not the person I was before. 

I like hanging out with people and socializing. I dont go out anymore and when I do go out I dont go with anyone. I feel that  it's too risky and that everyone is a potential predator. I don't want to feel this way anymore. I miss me. I'm going tonstart therapy. Just have to wait a few more months. 

I'm not sure what I wanted making this post. I just needed to say something.

15070,1hublqv,post,my brother sa’d me,"i dont know how to have a relationship with my brother 


trigger warning: Sexual assault, anxiety, depression, physical assault 

my brother (19m) has Down Syndrome. I (20F) don’t know how to deal with the pain he has caused me. 

Context: Ken is my adopted brother. I have a bio brother, John (M18)

When Ken was 16 he started going through puberty. He has down syndrome so no one knew how to explain this to him. Ken doesn’t know the difference between girlfriend and sister. i used to be very close with Ken. i was often given the task of watching him and i was often alone with him. when Ken started going through puberty, he would touch me inappropriately. i didn’t know what to do. i just froze. i didn’t yell at him, i didn’t move, i didn’t stop him from doing this. i told my parents, but they didn’t know what to do. they basically said 
that he wasn’t to be in a room alone with me. 

after some time of nothing of significance happening with Ken, my other brother, John, caught him looking through the keyhole in my door (super old wooden door with keyhole) after i had gotten out of the shower. when John caught him, he punched him. i have always felt that my family is too hard on Ken. he’s my little guy. so when this specific event happened, i felt like it was my fault. sometimes i can feel myself convincing myself that i made it all up. 

when i moved back home after uni, Ken was still there (duh), but John had left for uni. without John there, i felt like there was no buffer. Ken had been spying on me in my room (i opened the door and found him there) my parents continued to leave Ken home alone with me until he said something about us sharing a bed. 

i feel like all of this is my fault because i should’ve pushed him or said something to him in the moment. i feel like im living a double life and i don’t know how to have a relationship with him. he’s still my little guy. i practically raised him. eldest daughter syndrome has me in its clutches.

I have a younger brother with Down syndrome who I also helped a LOT with growing up. I’m so close with him. I can’t imagine him doing something like that. It would absolutely break my heart.

I will say that with my brother, there is a weird disconnect because he’s the same age as your brother (19) and he clearly has sexual thoughts, but my mother still treats him like he’s a little kid. Both my middle brother and I (I’m the oldest) have expressed to our parents that we feel they infantilize my youngest brother a little too much.

That said, what you’ve described here is absolutely assault. I 100% get feeling conflicted about it and I don’t think it’s Ken’s fault, per se. I would say if anyone’s to blame, it’s your parents for not properly explaining things to him. My brother did go through a brief period of time where he didn’t understand he couldn’t marry his female relatives. It was quickly explained to him that we are his sister/cousin/etc. and you don’t marry family. He got it and it hasn’t been a problem since.

15096,1hueme4,post,"Just got raped again after a while, I don't know what to do","So yesterday I went to a friend's house for his birthday party (I thought he was a friend and someone I could trust, but now I see that that wasn't the case).
Anyways, for most of the night things were pretty pretty normal: drinking, smoking, dancing, etc. As it went on, I drank more than I should've, so I got drunk -not drunk enough to black out or anything, I remember everything that happened-. 
After most people had left (it was just me, him, a few of his friends and some other people I didn't know), the birthday boy approached me and started talking about how I ""didn't give him a present, but could make it up to him"", and how  ""my slutty little waist was the best present he'd ever get"". Long story short, he wouldn't take no for an answer and took me to his bedroom by force. There, he undressed me, had sex with me and touched me for around 3 hours, he also forced me to give him head and beat me up with a belt whenever I tried to defend myself or didn't do what he told me to (My back, legs and butt are bruised like crazy). Throughout this time, I screamed for help, begging him to stop and trying to fight him off, but it was all in vain, it was all drowned out by the loud music still being played on the stereos. By the time he finished, I felt like shit (both physically and mentally) and left in a hurry, I didn't get my heels, necklace or bracelets back, I was afraid he would try and do something else to me, or rape me again.
Anyways, this is unfortunately not the first time I get raped in my life (my stepdad did it three times around 5 years ago), but having it happen now really messed everything up, I feel like the world is crashing down on me. 
First off, I feel like being raped again just undid all the work that I've been doing for the past half-a-decade to heal from that traumatic experience, and just reopened the wound, but even deeper and bigger than before: I feel vulnerable, powerless and shitty again, my emotions are running wild. I was doing well and this fucking shit happens, what did I even do to deserve this?
Second, I can't shake this feeling of self loathing. Both my stepdad and this guy are assholes, but maybe I'm doing something wrong? It isn't normal to get raped 4 times in 18 years of life. Am I a problem? Am I weak? What the fuck is going on?  
Rant over, I just don't know what to do or what to feel anymore, I don't know how I can ever trust others ever again, or how I can love myself after being treated like a fucking sex toy again","Just got raped again after a while, I don't know what to do So yesterday I went to a friend's house for his birthday party (I thought he was a friend and someone I could trust, but now I see that that wasn't the case).

15127,1huhp69,post,it keeps coming back to me,"So when I was 17 yo m I was deeply insecure and struggling with a lot of mental health problems was having the worst of my eating disorder that I've ever had was severely under weight and just struggling with life. I still have all of these issues but it's something i've just learned is apart of me. I was very lonely and I would crave attention from men online expose myself to them easily when they wanted etc it didn't feel right or good but i wanted attention and was getting it like that even if i didn't want that kind of attention. Well one day i met this guy on grindr he called himself ""tyler"" and he seemed cool and nice and stuff so i talked to him and kept talking to him eventually one day when i was at the mall with my friend he showed up there and forced my hand to meet him which i kinda liked only because i struggle to try and meet someone it's just really hard for me to do so this kinda forced me into it and therefore allowed me to than go hang with him and stuff later on and it broke the ice. So we would hang out and he would come pick me up from my house basically always at night and we would go in his car drive around and stuff sometimes we would stop for him to eat only i never wanted to eat i didn't eat really ever back then still struggle with it very much to this day. He would always touch me like when he was driving touch my thigh or inner thigh and i didn't really want him to he would tell me to wear short shorts and stuff and i did and i didn't really like or want him to touch me idk but i didn't say anything. Even before meeting he made a comment online about my hair that he didn't like it thought it looked bad and i changed it and cut it... why? i'm not sure. i was deeply insecure and still to this day what other people think rules who i am and how i feel about myself and i think my experience with him has ruined a lot of the work i try to do to better myself because i just have his voice in my head and his hands touching me over and over makes me feel so disgusting. So he would tell me what to wear like ideas of what he sorta liked and so i would i would wear those things and he would pick me up and again touch me and i would just let it happen. He started also grabbing my throat like and pushing at me like that and like i would awkwardly giggle not liking it kinda being scared of that but i didn't ever tell him not to do it. Also he was 22 or 23 i forget which he said he was over 6 feet and giant like extremely muscular big guy easily overpowering to me and so when he was doing these things it was startling me but for whatever reason i liked the attention he gave me and so i would continue to go out with him and let him pick me up and go with him. We never really left his car besides a couple times to go in a store. I remeber the first time i really became more uncomfortable was when we pulled into a parking lot around midnight it was empty and he told me to get in the back seat and i remeber being hesitant and clearly hesistant asking why and he insisted it was more comfortable and stuff and so i climbed back there. He than came back there to and told me to hold him and he made me wrap my arms around him and he layed on top of me i remeber how heavy he was on me i could barely breath right and just holding him and him telling me to rub his hair and him telling me how my body was uncomfortable for him because i was so ""bony"" once again making me feel like shit about my body and i said nothing beside a little giggle about it but felt very uncomfortable and sad. I was uncomfortable and not wanting this and i remeber it felt like forever before i went home. Another time i remeber that made me feel the most unsafe and afraid of him and I stopped talking to him after this and blocked him was when we parked in a parking lot fo a hiking trail it was very late at night no cars around nobody around literally woods all around empty and pitch black and im also afraid of the dark btw. He once again told me to climb in the back and i did. He came back there and i was wearing short shorts like he woudl tell me and he started touching me again telling me how soft i was and stuff and me just giggling about it again. He than took my wrists in both his hands and told me to try to pull away cause he thought it ""funny"" how ""little and weak"" i was compared to him. And i was able to pull them away not at all in any way. And this made me afraid of him i didn't like how he was doing this and i was uncomfortable with it and scared of that. Being alone with him like this was scary. He than pushed my head at his crotch as a ""joke"" whilst touching my stomach and etc. Grabbing my butt and etc. Touching me with his big hands i can still feel them exactly like it happened just now. It just makes me feel so gross so embarrased to have continuously gone out with him when i felt so uncomfortable and unsafe with him. Why would i continue to go with him why would i continue to accept his invitations. Why would i continue to go with him in that car that i was afraid of him in why why why... it just feels so humiliating and embarrasing. After he brought me home that night i remember blocking him and ghosting him. He made me feel so bad about myself telling me things about myself that i was bad looking or ugly or felt gross or needed to eat less or etc. He made me feel worse when i already hated everything about myself while also making me feel loved by giving me attention. He would be so kind to me and make me feel so heard and seen and than he started being mean to me and I felt so so gross. I still to this day have not been able to be intimidate with anyone have not been able to date anyone or be with anyone. I'm uncomfortable and afraid of vulnerability or any form of intimacy and i've been trying to cope with the fact that he had so much effect on me and trying to get over it. I just feel so stupid because it could have been so much worse and so many people deal with such horrific things and i just don't feel like what happened was that bad and i always feel so embarrased for even caring or letting it have such a massive effect on me and my life and how i feel. It's just so hard for me to even function in these scenarios and it's terrifying. I know i'm afraid of intimacy and vulnerability cause i believe i'm disgusting and think everyone else will find me just as disgusting and will harm me or be mean to me. I know that his making me trust him and than being so nasty to me is what has made me so untrusting of others. I'm afraid of being naked with someone and being touched when all i can feel is him and it just is scary i feel like if i do it the other person will just hate what they see it just feels so scary to do it idk how people do it. I wish i wasnt so stupid back then and i wish i hadn't been so fucking attention seeking and wanting to spend time with someone and continuing to put myself in that situation.","it keeps coming back to me So when I was 17 yo m I was deeply insecure and struggling with a lot of mental health problems was having the worst of my eating disorder that I've ever had was severely under weight and just struggling with life.

My ex sexually abused me all throughout our relationship, which was three years. I developed severe vaginismus during that time and I think she’s the reason I find it almost impossible to find sex pleasurable. It’s been all consuming lately and it’s so frustrating. I didn’t even realize till this year that she sexually abused me and she had me convinced I was coercing HER. 

I have a wonderful partner and I want to just enjoy having sex but I all I can worry about is how I don’t feel good. Sometimes it does but those are such rare occasions and more often than not the experience is okay, and even if I do enjoy it it’s not because it was overwhelmingly pleasurable. I don’t know. It’s a lot and it’s all consuming lately, and sometimes I wish I never came to the realization that she was abusing me. It felt easier back then. Just wanted to put this into the abyss.

15151,1hukeru,post,Is there a future for my relationship after intimate partner assault?,"My partner assaulted me while I was unconscious after a night of drinking. Before this we were madly in love. He was going to support us while I did my masters. He woke up extra early to make me lunch and breakfast before work. We shared the same love languages, the same humor, the same interests. We played DnD on Wednesday's and shared friends and made art together. He makes me the most beautiful gifts. We pretend it's my birthday every month and he will make me a treat with a candle on it. Before bed we draw shapes on each others back before and whisper stories to one another. We throw fun diner parties and go dancing together. We graduated college together last year and actively chose to pursue our future together. He got me a promise ring. We recently moved in together. I have always been told how lucky I am, how good a man he is. 

When I woke up to it happening I saw him sober up. He was muttering ""I thought you were awake."" I left the room and when I came back he wanted to talk - I told him I needed space and that we would talk in the morning. This happened a week ago and he has done about everything I would hope he would. He named it assault from the beginning, told his close friends about what he did, told his family. He hasn't shyed away from this to protect his reputation. He is coming to terms with his twisted relationship to sex and consent and has found a therapist to work through these issues. He is seeking couples therapists for us. He is temporarily staying with his parents and doing a 1 and a half hour commute to work so I can have my space. I can see how much he hates himself and how much he is hurting,

He keeps affirming that he didn't know I was asleep, maybe thats whats keeping me with him. He was drunk and in and out of sleep and doesn't know how it started. I still know I would never do that to someone despite how drunk or out of it I was, and that he still deserves consequences. He does have some memories of it too. I mean, how do you not know my limp unconscious body is not awake? Per our conversations we agreed he chose not to know, took any slight motion or sound on my part as proof I was awake.

I want things to be normal, I can't pay rent on my own and we just moved into this place. But at the times he has been home to grab stuff or check in it's just so different. There are times I cant even look at him now. I don't feel comfortable sharing the same bed as him. I hate hearing him talk casually to the housemates it makes me hate him so much. I can't imagine us sharing friends, going dancing, or drawing invisible shapes on each others back to go to sleep. I can't imagine going on dates or being in love or waking up together. It's so jarring from feeling that he was my forever person.

So - is there healing in this? What does healing look like? Is there a possibility for a future with this person? Can we move on and arrive at a similar or even better place?

He did told it to his close friends, told his family (That takes real fortitude) seeking counseling.

So, it comes down to what happened. Were you both having sex when you passed out? How much time had passed and is there a chance he might not have known? Do you feel you could forgive him if it wasn't malicious? Have there any any other warning signs?

15168,1hulifu,post,My childhood molester is probably going to be released from prison. !SENSITIVE CONTENT ABOUT MINORS!,"When I was 8 my moms then boyfriend started molesting me, I have no idea when it started and when it ended, but I know I was 9 when it ended and I was 10 when all the court stuff was done. He was sentenced to 8 years to life in prison, and the judge said if he ever reoffended he’d be put in jail for life. He was charged with 2 counts of child molestation in the first degree, with an aggravating factor, and 2 counts of communicating with a minor for an immoral purpose. He tried to argue that I over exaggerated on multiple other occasions and that I was blowing his actions out of proportion. I wish I was lying, I hate the memories, and the dirty feeling I get when I think of them, I hate that the little girl in me comes out now that he might be released, he ruined my life, he was the spark that started a forest fire. 

At first me and my brothers would spend a night at his house, but soon it turned in to just me occasionally, then just me pretty much every weekend. He took me with him  and bought a back massager. When I laid on the couch watching TV, he would come and lay down with me and use it on me. It happened many, many times, maybe a couple every visit. And I visited a lot. He would bring me to an orgasm, embarrassingly, I didn’t know what they were, or that what he was doing was wrong. His desk was on the right side of the couch I would lay on. One day he showed me a website showing under wear with beads down the center. He asked me which ones I liked and later that week, when they arrived he had me try them on. I hated how he would stare at me. I felt gross, and I became more shy, sitting in my room more.

Sometimes I would take a bath with him, he called it “tubby time”, most of the time I was actually taking a bath, because his mom was so old and “bigger” there was a seat in the back of the tub he would sit in. I remember one time seeing his “member”poke out of his shorts as he watched me bathe. On another occasion he had bought chocolate syrup and cool whip. He had me sit in his lap and rub them both into his chest. Then he put a blindfold on me and wanted me to guess which food he was putting in my mouth. I remember licking the cool whip, and realizing his “finger” felt a lot like a tongue, I could feel the bumps, and a scar across it he had from something. I don’t remember anything after that though

Another time when we were laying on the couch he had laid eye level with my chest, and kissed my nipple, then told me to do the same, he gave a reason for it but I don’t remember what he said, I remember just staring at him, then he got up returning to his desk.

I’m not sure how old I was but he had introduced me to porn, I was 8 addicted to watching porn. My addiction went all the way until I was 13, it was destroying my life, my relationship with my wonderful girlfriend, and the way I saw sex. I associated all of that with him. 

I remember when my mom finally found out. She was making quesadillas in the kitchen, and asked me if I wanted to go to his house for the weekend. Like 2 weeks before this I was talking to my friend about our “dads”, I tried to talk to them about what he was doing thinking they’d relate but they didn’t, which is when I realized what he was doing was wrong. So I stopped going to his house, afraid and embarrassed, my mom knew something was wrong when I refused again for the 2nd week in a row so she took me to her room and asked me in private. I don’t remember what I told her, but by the end she was crying and asking how she could let this happen, how she didn’t know, and apologizing over and over again. 

At the time my grandma worked for a police station so my mom went out and told her, cops soon arrived, and went to his house to gather evidence. A couple weeks later I was made to do a DNA swab and have a vaginal inspection to see if he had ever penetrated me, which he didn’t, but they wanted to be sure. My DNA was found on the back massager, but weirdly the underwear he had bought me disappeared. I don’t know if he somehow knew the police were coming, but I know they were real, I know the haunting memory and the embarrassment was real, how would an 8 year old even know about underwear like that, what reason would I have to make it up? 

This all happened 7 years ago, I’ve grown as a person, I look different, I act different, I go by a different name, and I see him differently now. I used to be scared of him, now I’m just pissed, how could he do that to me? I remember being so happy finally having a father figure, I’m just glad I never called him dad.

Now he might be released from prison a year early, I thought I would be moved out by now, a grown up, with a place I could call home, where he didn’t know where I lived, but now I’m a couple months away from 17. I’m so confused, I was finally starting to forget him and love on, the memories were fading, along with his stupid, ugly, toothless, drug addict, face. I have no idea what to do, I received the letter on January 3rd of this year, letting me know there was a hearing sometime in April. Where the court would decide if he was okay enough in the head to be released. I can choose to attend, or write a letter, or send a video talking about how his release would damage me. I was granted a lifetime restraining order against him and his entire family. Not once have they tried contacting me, or starting anything. He also never caused trouble in jail, although he was beat up numerous times, and even hospitalized before the official court date. 

I just don’t know what to do, I wanna go to the hearing, but I’m not sure if I wanna face him. Sometimes I feel strong, like seeing him would bring closure, and he would regret and feel guilty just by the sight of me, but sometimes I feel weak, like he’d stare down at me, hungry for revenge, or even with pure anger, I’m scared I’ll be the same little girl he knew 7 years ago. If I did decide to not to go I will definitely write a letter, but I want it to be read out to the court, the first letter I wrote was 3 pages long, talking about how I was to strong and good hearted for him, how different our families are, and how he affected me, but when it was time for it to be read out, it was decided not to, instead the judge went in the back, read it himself, then came back and gave a quick summary about my pain. I wanted him to remember my words, my pain, but that was taken from me, now I have another chance, and I’m gonna take it. I’m feeling the strong right now, I want him to see what I’ve grown into and fear the sight of me. I want him to be so embarrassed he can’t lift his head, I want to see the same tears and cries I had pour from him. I hope the memories of his beatings are fresh, just like mine are now. I hope he can feel my anger in the room, feel my hateful stare, as I watch him fight for his freedom, something he should’ve never been offered, just like me. I want to see the judge make the decision, then I want to feel free, done, never to think about any of it again. I’m sorry this is so long but this is 9 years of anger and hate written out in my own words, words he hasn’t heard yet.

a couple of years ago i started regaining some memories of my childhood, some that ended up impacting me a lot more than i could've ever expected. 
what i remembered from when i was younger (ages ~3-6) was always a blur, like, if someone asked me about something from when i was a kid, i wouldn't be able to recall it, my friends found me weird for that. although, i did have a lot of friends, and was kind of popular, but i never felt like i was really understood. it was confusing. i felt both a lot younger, yet more mature than the other kids around me.
i would also often go hide, far away from everyone else and just masturbate. i hate thinking about it now, knowing i did that at my age.
as the years passed by, i lost my disgusting habit of touching myself, but i also completely forgot i was doing it in the first place.
when i was around 10-12 i started slowly remembering everything. i'll put it simply; my sibling had raped me. and as i remembered and remembered and remembered i felt like i was going insane. i realized how disgusting and dirty and gross i was for having that happen to me. and together with my memories, i regained my revolting habit. i hated it. i hated myself for being so disgusting and i hated what i did because of my hate. it quickly grew into an addiction. it all made me even more disgusting than i was in the first place. 
but this wasn't the only affect it had on me. it also made me absolutely terrified of my sibling, i was so scared, i was scared it'd happen again. i would stay inside my room so i wouldn't have to see them. whenever i had to go outside i thought everyone looked at me with disgust and hate and knew how evil i was. i thought they were going to sa me again.

I just don’t know because he would always tell me he would kill anyone who ever did that to me again because of how many times it’s happened in the past. I just can’t comprehend if it was SA or not. It’s been 6 months since and I still can’t understand..",0,2.0,2025-01-06 0:36,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hum5yr/i_dont_know_if_what_he_did_was_sa_or_not_and_its/,Neutral

You know, you could go the other direction if you’re not getting support from your family. Call him out for being a disgusting perv… you catch him when you’re trying to sleep, yell at him to quit playing with his dick, loudly. Make others uncomfortable. When is around and he tries to talk to you, say something like “what do you want perv?” or “I’m sorry, I didn’t hear you wanker”. Make sure your others hear it. 

I’m suspecting your mom is just hoping you will be quiet to keep the peace. What I am proposing is plan “Fuck the Peace”. The risk with this lies with your brother if he has violence tendencies. If he does, your best choice is to find some place else to live. I’m sorry, but what he is doing is rude, inappropriate, inconsiderate, disgusting, and disrespectful (to you). Unfortunately however, it is not assault. Harassment, maybe, but that is usually a civil issue, not criminal. 

Hang in there. Or, find a way to bail from that toxic situation… your choice. Leaving things as they are seems to be causing you serious issues though."," There is no reason you should have to interact with him any more than absolutely necessarily. Can you sleep elsewhere? On the couch maybe?

15193,1humtcw,post,how do i tell my family my cousin SA me?,"TW: SA

i’d really love advice on my situation. it’s a lot so please bear with me. idk where to start so i’m just gonna start. 

i was SA by my older cousin growing up. he’s 4-5 years older than me. i guess you’d consider it COCSA because he was under 18 but that’s no different than regular SA. the trauma & effects are still the same. he was also a teenager and he knew better. i’ve repressed a lot & sometimes memories i don’t even recall flashback into my mind. i don’t really remember when it first started. i know it was throughout my middle school years, which made him in HS. looking back on it, i feel a lot of things. i wish i would’ve told somebody, anybody. then it wouldn’t have happened to me so many times & if he did do it to someone else hypothetically, i could’ve prevented it by speaking up. i was a child & when i do remember, i just remember freezing & letting it happen. i know my feelings are/were valid. i know it’s not my fault but sometimes i still feel that way. anyway, i’m going to get to the advice part. 

i’m in my 20s, married, & expecting my first baby in less than a month. i’m truly happy, blessed, & in a good place. my husband knows about my SA & who did it. because i’ve kept this secret for so long, i still see my cousin at family events. i’ve just dealt with it all these years. my family loves him just as much as they love any other member & even as a child, i just never had the heart to tell my loved ones what he did to me for years. the good in me didn’t want to hurt his character or future. i wish it wasn’t like that.. 

i’ve decided that since i’m bringing a baby into this world & into my family, i will no longer be attending family events that my cousin is at. my husband knows this & agrees/supports my decision. i can’t have a predator around my baby girl. i wasn’t protected, but i’ll do everything in my power to protect her. 

with that being said, how do i go about telling my family that i’ll no longer be attending family events/holidays IF my cousin is present? at first i was just going to straight up tell them i’m done coming if he’s there & not give them an explanation. but they’ll want to know why. and i think it’s time for me to talk about it.. i feel the little girl in me still needs justice.. but as i previously stated, i don’t have the heart to tell them! i don’t even know where i’d begin. i also live out of state & only travel for the holidays. i can’t talk about it over the phone. i’ll cry so much that i can’t talk & it’ll feel too awkward & i still wouldn’t even know what to say or where to begin! i can’t just be like “___ SA’d me.” & that be that? i mean i could but.. i just need an outside perspective 😣 how do i go about this? my family also deserves an explanation? 

i’ve tried to imagine different scenarios where i told them in my head. at first i wanted to make a group text message to my mom, grandma, & aunt & tell them EVERYTHING. but over a text..? but i also just can’t do it otp.. then i thought about texting my mom about it first.. then all i can think about is their reactions.. my mom could feel like she’s failed as a parent & couldn’t protect me. my aunt could be devastated it happened under her roof. it’s a LOT. am i worried they won’t believe me? honestly, i haven’t thought about that too much. not really. i will say i don’t want to hear anyone say why i’m mentioning it now but i don’t think any family member would do that. do i expect them to just immediately cut him out of their lives? nah. do i expect them to uninvite him to every family event just so that i can come? no. will i still be mad if they continue contact with him? no. maybe other people would answer yes but no for me. i don’t know what their reactions would be but i was going to tell them that with christmas for example, we can all get together & still exchange gifts & see each other. it just won’t be in christmas day. we’ll plan another date where he’s not there. 

 i don’t know what to do. i need guidance. also, i’m looking into going to therapy & getting the help/healing i need. i just don’t know when because insurance is an issue but that’s a different story.

Has anyone here who has experienced rape/SA ever felt concerned about their fertility after what happened? 
I didn’t ever get pregnant from my rapes, even though it happened many times and it was unprotected. They didn’t ejaculate inside me everytime and I have got the ”morning after” pill atleast 4 times in hospital. I never got STD. I have had a few UTI and BV in my life, but those have been treated. 
I’m happy I didn’t get pregnant at that age, because I was under 18 but I still feel bad. My periods are normal I think and I think I can feel when I’m ovulating when I don’t take birth control. I have been examined and tested by gynecologists many times because of those crimes. They never said that something is wrong or broken in my vagina or in my reproductive organs. They didn’t say I should be worried that I didn’t get pregnant. But I’m so afraid that I’m not fertile, that I have got panic attacks from thinking about this and I have been considering even suicide when I feel at my lowest.

15202,1hunhm6,post,My mom says I have not been sexually assaulted except for the third time,"So I have had sexual actions done to me three different times by three different people but my mom says the first two werent sexual assault and so I figured I would ask people in similar situations because Im really not sure.

Warning: both times involve me as a minor under 14 and both are described with some detail

So when I was about 8 years old, my mom was dating this really bad guy (my parents are divorced with split custody) and he drank and smoked all the time around us. He had a long criminal record. My mom left us alone with him a lot. One time, he had his sirt off. I had never seen a man with his shirt off before and asked him about it. He said men could take their shirts off. I asked if I could and he said yes and got me to take my shirt off in front of him. I stood there half naked with him for over half an hour. I dont really remember anything after taking my shirt off, the memory is hazy.

I can see why that first one wouldnt count as Sexual Assault, though I have been told it may count as grooming as he convinced me he was a great guy. A year or so after that he started acting like the a-hole he is. I began to hatehim and when i was maybe 10 or 11, I finally never saw him again.

Alright when I was maybe 9 or 10, my younger brother (2.5 years younger than me) started touching my butt. Grabbing it, slapping it, stuff like that. I would scream at him every time and he would go crying to mom that I yelled at him. Mom would then yell at me saying what he did wasnt a big deal. But it got worse. He started forcing his way into the bathroom any time I was showering or undressed. I always told him no and started locking the door. If I didnt open it, he would throw a tantrum in front of the door. My mom would then come and force me to open it because he probably just has to use the bathroom and she doesnt want to deal with him acting like this. There are two bathrooma in our house, only one has a shower. He always had to be in the one I was showering in. Mom almost always made me let him in. This went on for years as I was too scared to say anything to my dad. I was worried he would yell at me like mom did. When i was about 12 the bathroom stuff ended but he would still touch my butt. When I was 13, I finally told my theralist. She strongly advised me to tell my dad. The signs of sexual abuse had been becomming more clear and my dad had been begging me to tell him what was going on. I always said I didnt know.

I did tell him and he said he knew someone was doing something but wasnt expecting it to be my brother. He talked to him. Turns out my brother didnt know the extent of what he was doing. I always guessed he saw it on a youtube video and didnt realized how bad what he was doing was, especially since mom said it wasnt a big deal and made me let him. He only touched me one time after that, and we were with my dad. I screamed at him and dad put a stop to it.

I brought up what happened with moms exboyfriend when I was older because I was also terrified of men with shirts off. She didnt believe me. She said even if that happened, its not sexual assault because I asked if I could and willingly did it. Eventually I brought up what happened with my brother and she told me that also wasnt sexual assault and she didnt remember making me let him. 

I have a lot of flashbacks from what my brother did and it took me a very long time to trust that people wouldnt touch me. I still get scared when I am touched unexpectedly. Everyone im close with understands and is careful about it. My brother feels bad supposedly but also says he never sexually abused me and that its in the past and I should just let it go. Im starting to feel like im overreacting and I dont know what to do about it. So does this count? Im so confused

So we greet and talk while the person and my mom are verbally fighting no surprise while trying to fix the tire issue. couple weeks later my mom tells me they’re going to the beach with their dad but that new kid i met will also be there. i swallow my pride or wtv preventing me from seeing red when in his presence and decided after not wanting to, to go so i can force myself to socialize even if it was with someone i might not like (no socializing for about 12+ months and two mental health admissions during) i’m at the bitxh me and kid are talking turns out he smokes too kool something in common we end up smoking and somewhere between me feeling artificially better cause of the weed i muster up the ability to block out anything having to do with my SA including identifying the person infront of me (the person who did sa me) with the sa if that makes sense so i was able to kinda think of him as a separate person all together in a way which allowed me to get over the Barrier that was making things very awkward with my mom & siblings they would make plans and not invite me cause of what happened which is still very confusing for me. but i wanted to i don’t know get over it in some way because it had a grip on me still does that makes me very suicidal and i was very tired of being and feeling so alone. after that beach trip me and S hang out we end up wanting to look for a place to smoke he suggests going to persons house since “he goes there all the time to smoke” (have never seen him in there ever again) after that i see person being grateful to S kinda saying in a way “thanks for bringing back my son to me” i didn’t think much of it at the time. then i catch myself going there my myself to have a place where i can do substances without feeling so antisocial idk change of scenery always helps me and this is the fastest way to do it. person would slowly try to get me to be comfortable to speak again, unfortunately it works idk why maybe i allowed it to work cause of some weird complex feelings, but it also works cause we don’t speak about anything in the past only present topics and we kinda speak as two people in a bar i like to think of it. until today, where we end up calling my step brother (his son) after the call i ask him “i wonder why you kept my step siblings (brother & sister same dad different moms) from me when i was younger i feel like if i had older siblings i would turn out better” so he says let’s call him and ask (he is drunk and coked up i forgot to mention the person has had alcoholism and coke addiction since before my mom met him and no my mother has never touch any substance but wine on religious holidays) i also cracked open a soju and have a couple of hits from a cart in me while smoking a cig at the time of calling my step brother. step brother picks up person asks the question “why did i never include you and step sister in his(my) life “ brother misunderstands the timing of when he wasn’t included and thinks he is talking about me reporting the SA. step brother basically ends up telling me that i fucked it up by reporting “the old man” and that’s why him and my step sister didn’t speak to him or my family ever again. until i assume i allowed it to seem like a lie by acting like i’m okay with the person who SAed me that’s when i realized in that moment everyone thinks i’m fucking lying and i allowed it to be viewed that way. i don’t know what to do lol my younger sister probably thinks i was lying, my step siblings for sure do my behavior doesn’t act like someone who has been SAed, my mom was the person who i fed even allowed this to happen by still accepting his financial support, my other sister is non-verb neuro-devergent.

15238,1husnub,post,Trying To Expose My SA And People Are Getting Angry ,"I was SAED a while back for many years but I started recalling more details about what happened. I have injuries from what happened in my hip/femur and the female parts. I blocked out how I got them but now I recalled that it was from the SA being aggressive and afterwards my hip/femur popped durinng the time it was happening. I was SAED from child to late teens (my last memory was around 17). But I remember that I was around 17 I was getting SAED I remember that my hips had pain when it was happening but it popped I believe the next day I notice a huge pop. I would also feel poking, sharp/burning pains, and having pain urinating more around 16 to 17 years old. I also have tender tissue that sticks out of the opening of down there. I didn't recall the reason for my hip/femur being in pain until now. I remember 17 (around August of 2023) I started processing only small glimpses of my SA and the grooming from adults and their children. About a few weeks ago I had more memory recall of what happened and how my hip/femur popped like that. I was told by someone on Reddit to go to the hospital and try to file a police report. I went to the hospital December 30 2024 and they didn't have all the answers but told me to go to an orthopedist, OBGYN, counseling, and more. On December 31 2024 I went to the orthopedist and the doctor suspects a labral tear from the SA and told me to get an MRI. I set up a Gofundme because my family and I are in debt and can't afford the $5,000 deductible for this year to afford diagnosing and treatments. I was getting some comments online getting really angry at me telling me that I need Jesus, I need a psychologist, that none of what I'm saying makes sense, etc. I am keeping screenshots of these conversations for evidence because it seems very guilty that people are angry/dismissing that I'm serious about this despite explaining everything and showing a picture of me at the ER.

15243,1huszea,post,Was this SA,"So I’ve been in a relationship with a girl who has bpd. We had alot of ups and downs but one of them took place when we were having sex. I’ve never went raw and came inside a woman before, so the sex was great for both of us. Nearing the end I was getting close to climaxing and I heard once my girlfriend say, “I need to go pee.” I said, I’m almost there hold on, and then 30 secs later I finished. After the fact she went to the bathroom and came back and she was looking sad, so I asked what was wrong, and she said I had just SA’d her. Since I didn’t know and she was saying u did that I was devastated because I thought we were just having sex and what u did was normal. After she said that she understands that I wasn’t aware and she forgives me and for me not to do it again. Let me preface that in my position I only heard her say that once, my girlfriend said many months after that she said she said that multiple times, in which I didn’t remember because I clearly remember her saying it once, but because of her bpd and chances of splitting and constant fights cause because it was one of our memories was right, I started doubting my own memory and just went with what she said.

The thing is that we moved on from it and had great times as a couple. It’s only after I broke up with her she found the need to tell a couple of my friends that I SA’d her during the relationship causing me to lose one really close friend. The other two said they understood that it wasn’t on purpose and stayed friends with me. After the fact she said that to my friends I wanted to ask her about an experience that she did to me. After her bringing it back up, it made me think about a time before I did that to her. When I realized she did that to me first. I asked my ex girlfriend now“Can you answer honestly? I’m not trying to say this just because you are saying this to my friends but, that time when you steadied me and was trying to put my dick raw inside and I was saying no and pulled away, and you kept trying to persuade me to go raw, and I gave in and did it for 1 minute, was that SA?” Mind you this was before the first event I mentioned. She said “No it isn’t, that’s just something couples do, I’m sorry if I made you uncomfortable though. 

I beat myself up alot over this, and some friends are telling me that my girlfriend SA’d me and I didn’t. They told me She was coercing me and tried forcing me in her which is SA.  But I still think I did because I didn’t listen the first time.

15266,1huuayi,post,Coerced and then drugged and raped,"A week ago Saturday what was supposed to be just a night out with my bestfriend, turned into the worst thing i have endured in my life so far. 

We met up with our friend at a local bar, he was here visiting as he lives a ways away. We meet one of his aquaintences, and he automatically was super overly flirty and would not stop complimenting me. I wasnt really entertaining it much. He pushed all of us to go hangout at his house, so we were all planning to meet there. He ended up riding in the car with me, due to events that lead up to that. He made me pull over to the side of the road because he saw his “plug”, left the car for 2 mins then came back (this matters later). Car ride really wasnt a big deal, i kept asking making sure my friend my friend was also going to his house because i had told him im not going there without her. A second later she calls me, tells me they are all at a bar, and he tries to convince me not to go, hes very pushy, but i say were going. 

We get to the bar, nothing to out of normal, i did notice how he knew every person in that bar but stated he hated the bar when i was driving prior. I had a few beers there, he did keep trying to grope me but i would try and move away. Mostly hung out with my 2 friends, he did keep trying to get me to leave early. We do all end up leaving, hes claimjng our friend who doesnt live here is coming as well. my friend is riding with his friend that basically also lives with him (this is why earlier she didnt ride with me initially to his place, he claimed his friend wasnt able to drive), the guy ends up driving me. I do have an open beer in the car. Car ride i barely remember. We arrive to his place, friend is there too, this is when the night completely turns into a blur. 

What i remember is us getting there, all sitting in the living room just hanging out as normal. Once again i do have a beer open. He flaunts a bunch of stuff to us, sometime during the night i end up sitting next to him. Dont remember much of this. I got up to use the restroom twice, thats when we somehow changed spots on the couch so he was closed to my drink then i was, he probably used this time to drug my beer if he didnt already at the bar or in the car. He pulls out a bag of “coke” he takes a bump, gives my friend a bump, and his friend a bump. I dont do shit like that so i refused. 10 minutes later my friend is sicker than hell. Within another 10 minutes im nearly incapacitated on the couch also feeling sicker than hell. I had a total of 8 drinks from 830pm-230am. 

I dont remember much of the rest of the night except for key points. Somehow i walked to his bedroom, undressed myself. He put me in doggy style, instantly put something in my ass, and then also made me hold a vibrator to myself. I was very oddly compliant, like nothing really mattered basically, i had no sense of reality. I could feel my body getting heavier, i remember losing grip of the vibrator and subconsciously (even though i was barely there) thinking, me losing grip doesnt make sense? And then it drops. And then somehow i end up on my back. All i remember from being on my back is him sucking my toes. Then i somehow ended up further on the bed, as i was down towards the end originally. I remember him coming up next to me, and then just like that, completely unconscious for atleast 3 hours. 

I came to it at around 6am, when i did i remember waking up and instantly feeling him inside me. I dont know if he was going so rough that it woke me up, or if i just was aware of the penetration. I remember looking down, i could see him but the entire room beyond him looked like as if i was in a fishbowl. My legs were propped up over him, he was horizontal while i was on my back. He pulled out the second he realized i was awake. This is when i checked my phone and saw it was 6am. I couldnt physically keep awake, so i passed back out until a few hours later. I felt so crazy like shit in the morning, never have felt that before, and my friend was asking where i was. 
In the morning he was very pushy about getting us out. My friends pants were unbuttoned when she woke up in the morning, but she had a bodysuit on that was hard to get off. She believes she wasnt assaulted. 

I remember getting in my car, instantly telling my friend he fucked me in my sleep. We both still were not in a conscious reality state. I barely remember the drive home, just a few parts. 

I have bruises all over my body, my ass was sore and still is sore. I have bruised ribs. Toxicology came back with nothing of significance, I reported 3 days after it happened because i didnt know if it was worth it. Im waiting to hear from a detective, hopefully sooner than later. I am honestly a wreck, trying to cope, and somehow figure out how im going to continue with having relationships with men. The first few days after i couldnt get out of bed. Some days are worse than others.

I wonder if i was recorded, tag teamed, i have literal bite marks, im like what did this man do to me? 
If anybody has experience with how long it took regarding the court system, id like some advice. He has a pretty lengthy criminal record.

15276,1huv3dw,post,Not sure if this was s/a or not,"Sorry if this is worded or formatted weird, this is my first time posting on Reddit! And sorry if it's insanely long I feel like if I don't give all the details I'm just gonna be told it wasn't sa or something.

For a little bit of background info, I'm a trans man and this person (I'll call them k) is nonbinary. Also this was my first relationship so idk if that changes anything?

Anyway so me and K became partners a little more than two years ago, throughout the whole relationship they were not a good partner, they were mean to people, didn't respect boundaries of other couples and probably ours either, they told our friends at the time that the reason their relationship was going downhill was because one of them was setting boundaries, and they were very attention seeking and would constantly vent to me in detail about how their family was abusive and would constantly send me pictures of their bloody noses or them crying.

About a month (give or take) Into our relationship we were cuddling in my bed and they were spooning me and had their arm around my waist. I honestly think they thought I was asleep when they did this because I was facing the opposite way and was really tired and actually trying to sleep. But they started putting their hand underneath my shirt, which I didn't mind at first but then they started moving their hand up towards my chest. I wasn't really sure how I felt about it at the time so I kinda of let it happen but they did start grabbing my chest and I don't really remember what happened after that but I know they didn't do any more than that.
I do remember my fight flight or fawn reaction kicking in during it but I also kinda lifted my arm so they could do it even though I was pretty uncomfortable? 

After that happened I met a guy (S) who I really got along with and was super nice and started hanging out with him and avoiding K, I eventually broke up with k and started dating S, which I know was mean to do that to them but they were a VERY toxic person even without this stuff, but while I was dating S I realized i couldn't fall asleep while I was cuddling him AT ALL and would have to lay on the opposite side of the bed to be able to fall asleep and I also could not fall asleep in the same room as other people and would usually just pull all nighters if I slept at a friend's house or just avoided sleeping at friends houses completely if I could and I also would get uncomfortable when S (consensually) touched my chest.

After I broke up with S, K started trying to become friends with me again and when they did they would constantly grab my hips and waist and hold my hand or arm or lean on me and even kissed me on the neck, which I let it all happen even though it made me uncomfortable because I didn't even connect the dots about why I was uncomfortable, but I definitely know that also started to fuck me up because I got immensely uncomfortable when anyone would touch me and even yelled at someone for touching me when he barely did.

I honestly only connected the dots of how that might be why I was so uncomfortable just this last year and it's been stuck in my head since and has made me very very dysphoric and insecure.

I also recently was talking to one of my friends (who has been friends with K since they were little) about K and she told me that she might've been sexually assaulted by K as well and she told me what happened and I definitely believe she was sa'd

Also just a side note I'm doing a lot better and have met some great people who have helped me get more used to being touched or sleeping in the same room as people even though they don't know what happened but I still do get kinda triggered sometimes even though it wasn't really that big of a deal and I'm probably just overreacting 😭 I mostly just wanted to post this because I'm terrified that if I tell my therapist about it ill feel invalidated and I'd rather be told it wasn't sa by strangers online then someone I have to talk to every week ","Not sure if this was s/a or not Sorry if this is worded or formatted weird, this is my first time posting on Reddit! And sorry if it's insanely long I feel like if I don't give all the details I'm just gonna be told it wasn't sa or something.

For a little bit of background info, I'm a trans man and this person (I'll call them k) is nonbinary. Also this was my first relationship so idk if that changes anything?

Anyway so me and K became partners a little more than two years ago, throughout the whole relationship they were not a good partner, they were mean to people, didn't respect boundaries of other couples and probably ours either, they told our friends at the time that the reason their relationship was going downhill was because one of them was setting boundaries, and they were very attention seeking and would constantly vent to me in detail about how their family was abusive and would constantly send me pictures of their bloody noses or them crying.

About a month (give or take) Into our relationship we were cuddling in my bed and they were spooning me and had their arm around my waist. I honestly think they thought I was asleep when they did this because I was facing the opposite way and was really tired and actually trying to sleep. But they started putting their hand underneath my shirt, which I didn't mind at first but then they started moving their hand up towards my chest. I wasn't really sure how I felt about it at the time so I kinda of let it happen but they did start grabbing my chest and I don't really remember what happened after that but I know they didn't do any more than that.

He said he was sorry and didn’t mean it in that way. Me being that young, I naively forgave him and said we can still be friends. Then a week or two later he tried to get me to come to his house alone. I was furious and at this point I sent him a rant about how disgusting he is to even try and get with a girl who’s not even 18 yet. I finally felt ready to go to my mother about this. We never had a tight relationship and she wasn’t very good to me but I thought this would be a time where she would stand up for me. She told me I was being stupid and over dramatic. She said it was a lie when I said to him it’s pedophilic for him to try and get with me because in our state it’s perfectly legal for him to pursue me at this age being that the consent age is 16 or 17 (I forget) she told me I should date him when I turn 18 because he makes good money amd he s a perfectly good man and said how nice of a figure I have and that I should have felt complimented that he took a liking to me so much. She made me apologize to him for getting upset at him. I had it all on record because I was weary about the conversation when coming to her. I was so disgusted, that I deleted it. I wanted to forget the details of what she said to me. 
I felt I had no one and if my own mother encourages it, then maybe I am being dramatic like her and the man both said. So I ""dated him"" when I turned 18. He assaulted and coerced me for five months. I am now 22 now and no one in my family believes me that it was her who pushed me to be with him. I want that voice recording back so I can prove to myself and my family that she helped coerce me into having relations with him. It was on a voice recording app. I know that once something is on a device it can never be fully erased (or something to that degree)
Is there a way 5 years later to retrieve that deleted recording? I don’t know where to start because I am not tech savvy.. I really need help.

15283,1huvkv2,post,My husband (40m) has been touching my daughter (11f),"Update: he left this morning. He isn’t coming back here. I’m calling my mom and having her come be with us so I can have my advocate in my corner while I stand strong for my daughter. 

Update 2:
School is closed due to weather. I can’t go up to the police station and I can’t call for them to come here because I don’t want a police presence here with my kids home. My mom is on her way, it’s a 4 hour drive. As soon as she gets here, I will tell her what’s going on then go to the station to file a report. 

just found out my husband has been touching my daughter (his step daughter) 

Before knowing any of this:
My husband recently has been coming to me complaining that my daughter is so rude to him and when he tries to hug her she pulls away. 
I’ve had a few conversations with her about it in the past when it was brought up, but nothing ever changed with her.

Finding out:
Saturday afternoon, we were standing in the kitchen after just coming home. We greeted all of our kids (total of 5, 4 boys and her). She pulled away when he put her arm her and I said “hey, why are being like that?!” Later I went into her room and we talked because I wanted to know what was up. With tear filled eyes and not knowing how to say it, she eventually told me. 

My response:
I was shocked! I kept my cool and let her know i appreciate her telling me. I gently asked for more details like how long has it been happening, where at, etc. I told her I’d handle it and that was brave for talking to me. I asked her if she minded if I hid my phone in her room at night when it was time to tuck her in. She agreed.

That evening:
It was a busy and stressful Saturday. Game night got a little heated between our kids, so tensions were high. He went to tuck her in after me and nothing happened, phew. She said “normally when he’s in a bad mood he won’t do it”

The next evening, Sunday:
I hid my phone again. He went to tuck in her after again. After, I went into her room to get my phone. I looked at her and she shook her head yes to let me know it happened. I went into the laundry room to watch the footage. 

What I captured:
You can’t see it, but his hand was up her shirt as they talked. You can’t hear him say “they are getting big”. 

At this point, I’m in shock and angry. I wanted so bad for it to be a misunderstanding. The 36 hours between her telling me and me actually seeing the evidence I was in denial but yet numb. 

My response to him:
I went back to my room, stone cold face and body language. After about 30 min, I asked “ how long have you been inappropriately touching NAME?!” he tried to lie and I cut him off and said “I have a video, don’t lie to me!”
He broke down crying. I said not but 10 words, and shed 0 tears, in this conversation that lasted 3 hours. He cried, was remorseful, apologetic, scared of what happens next. 

Now: 
It’s the next morning, he’s packing a bag and isn’t going to come home the rest of the week as I try to figure out what to do next. 

Logistics:
We have 5 kids. Two are mine and 3 are his. We have his 3 with us this week. My daughter is home until 1/17/25 then she goes to her dads (who is 4 hours away) for the weekend. 
I also have no family nearby, and I moved where I am away from them, to be with him because we were long distance before getting married. I moved into his house. It’s 5am, I can’t sleep. I haven’t told anyone and I don’t know what to do. 

I’m struggling:
My husband is (from what I thought) an amazing man. Such a good husband, loving, literally everything I dreamed of and more than i thought I ever deserved. Great dad to his 3 boys. 
I never in a million years thought I’d be in place questioning our marriage or leaving him. 

My question to the group:
What do I do?! I don’t want to ruin his life or lose him. I know I need to protect my daughter and I refuse to lose her over his actions. 

Has anyone ever stayed in a situation like this? 
Part of me what’s to call the cops, file a report and let the cards fall. 
The other part wants to stay and let things slowly heal.

he is touching a child. 

this is your daughter and you, as a parent, need to protect her. if she shared this information with you, please do something. please put her first even if that means that you lose him. 

your daughter is 11 years old and NO child should ever be sexualized. they should never be touched that way. they should never be worried about someone coming in their room in the middle of the night. in any way. it is not okay, it is not acceptable, and it is vile. what you should do as a mom (and as a person in general) shouldn’t be a question. 

i’ve been in a similar situation with a family member before and i didn’t tell anyone. i would never blame anyone for not knowing. but if i told my mom, and she stayed “hoping things will slowly heal,” i would hate her. it was one thing when you didn’t know, but now it is another because you do. i’m not trying to say that to be mean, but there should not be a doubt in your mind. 

i understand that you wanted it to be a misunderstanding, and i know you’re going back and forth in your mind.

but please leave him. move away. live with a friend. go back to your parents until you can become stable on your own. quite literally anything else than allowing them to be in the same house.",65,,2025-01-06 10:11,t3_1huvkv2,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1huvkv2/my_husband_40m_has_been_touching_my_daughter_11f/m5od5mg/,Neutral

The first man approached me when I was middle school age. He acted like he was guiding me and helping me. He made me expose myself to him and he spat on my self-esteem when I said I was scared. He bragged about his technique and stamina to a child (he looked like he was in his 30's). He would compliment me so much while I fell mute and paralyzed 

It happened with a different person at 18 and I feel like this shattered me as a girl. It was late at night, I was lost and looking for a place to charge my phone, and he followed me in his car. He was closer to my age and he had a girlfriend and a child (I saw his iPhone wallpaper when he whipped out his phone to record me without my consent)... I can't get over the fact that somewhere out there, there will always be footage of me taken advantage of. I don't know if he shared it or uploaded it, and I never will. While I struggled and while he grew closer to finishing, he complained that my teeth scratched him down there (I had no experience) and that I have to get better at it. I didn't even know him. And he had a child. I felt so disgusted and my whole world felt warped by this person I spent less than an hour with. It felt like some kind of sick joke

Both of them just used me and completely ditched me after finishing. I don't even know if the names they gave me are real. I don't know who they were. And they didn't know me. They'll never know me. Sometimes I wonder, ""Do they regret what they did?"" ... but I don't even want to know the answer 

How do you stop hating the truth when there's nothing good about it? How do you stop feeling so torn by people who dehumanized you and treated you like quick food? I've only tried burying it. I keep acting like it never happened or pretend like it's not my shameful, disgusting reality; I still don't know how to fully process it.

15316,1hux0fp,post,Doctor’s Visit,"This happened to me when I was around 5. I had to get a physical because I was just starting school. I still can’t get it out of my head and I am almost 21 now. I’m afab but not a woman. 

I don’t remember much of the visit because for years I blocked it out of my memory. I only remember the waiting room, parts of the exam, and my mom telling me how the doctor said that I was “so cooperative”. 

My parents weren’t in the room at all during the appointment which I later found out is not normal after I switched doctors. I was stripped completely naked, no gown or anything. I was forced to stay that way the entire exam. I remember him checking my ears, eyes, nose, and throat. I remember him taking my blood pressure and listening to my heart. I remember how cold it was. He started touching my chest and nipples. He tweezed them and then asked me to lay down. He then touched my genitals. He spread my lips, then started stretching them. Then he put his finger near the entrance but never went fully inside. That’s all I remember from the exam.

When I got home my mom was congratulating me because the doctor was complimenting me. Saying I was cooperative and talkative. I don’t even remember talking that much. I felt so disgusting when she said that and I didn’t know why. No one knows how I feel about that appointment and what really happened, not like they’d believe me. He was a doctor doing is job. I don’t know why I feel this way or if I can ever see a doctor ever again. 

I really don’t know what to do anymore. Part of me thinks I’m trans because of what happened. I’ve spent my entire life denying I was a victim, and denying I’m trans. I still am. No one would believe I was assaulted and no one would accept me for being trans. I’m living a lie and it’s eating me alive.

It’s incredibly traumatic.

You need to report this immediately to protect your children.

Please go to the nearest police station or call your child advocacy center asap and report.

You are the only safe adult in the family. It is your duty to report the abuse.

Also… worth noting-
Failure to report sexual abuse of a child is a crime and a serious charge, and a conviction can affect you for the rest of your life.
(Depending on the state you live in)

What you can do right away 
You can :
implement immediate prevention strategies. Google Body Safety for Young Children for ideas and strategies.

Keep kids highly supervised
Set up body safety rules.

Do not let your husband anywhere near your kids.

Your husband is probably addicted to pornography. And he is probably looking at CSaM. CSAM is also illegal. Child sexual abuse material. ( formerly referred to as child pornography)

This doesn’t happen overnight…
There may be other victims.

If there are any other x girlfriends with kids or X wives with kids- they may have been victims too.

Please report to protect yourself and your kids.
And get counseling and for your family.

You may have caught this early enough because your daughter told you.

After that she insisted we try it and I always said no it's bad, but she would make me do oral sex on her and she would do it to me to, and I vaguely remember she tied me to a desk with plastic handcuffs I always thought it was wrong and never wanted to do it.

15339,1huzjcc,post,"Not qualified for PEP, should I be reassured?","Hi, 
I was assaulted on Saturday night, don't really want to go into details but I don't remember a lot of it, it was unprotected and I woke up quite sore and feeling a bit battered.

I was really worried about STD's so I went to a SARC today to get looked at. I have this reoccurring loop about getting HIV, I have quite bad health anxiety anyway and obviously that's a nightmare scenario, I bought this up and they said that it wouldn't make sense for me to go on PEP because of the assaulter was known to me and not from a demographic where HIV is very common. 

I'm still a little scared, I don't know if I should be reassured that they're not worried about it. I was given a hepitis B vaccine and I'm getting a proper screening in a few weeks. I just have this horrible thought that it would be just my luck to get it. I feel a bit cursed. 

Edit: Hi, thank you for the comments. I've done a little more research and this is what it says on the Terrance Higgins trust website: 

""Who gets PEP
Text
The people who are likely to be prescribed PEP are those who have had receptive or insertive anal sex or receptive vaginal/frontal sex (or shared injecting equipment) with someone who is HIV positive and has a detectable or unknown viral load.

It's also recommended if you've had receptive anal sex with someone with an unknown HIV status who is from an area with high rates of HIV, such as sub-Saharan Africa.

If you've had insertive anal sex, insertive or receptive vaginal/frontal sex (or shared injecting equipment) with someone with an unknown HIV status from a high-risk area for HIV it may be considered.

It'll also be considered if you've had insertive vaginal/frontal sex with someone who is HIV positive with an unknown or detectable viral load.""

So I don't think that it's necessarily the fault of the support workers that I saw, they were really great I think the policy about it is a bit outdated. 

I do just guess I'll be a little anxious for a little while. The chances of me having it are quite low- but I have been known to have terrible luck so I'm still quite worried. I'm also sorry if this has been not very nice to read if you're living with HIV, I know it's not the death sentence it once was and I don't judge anyone who is HIV+, but the thought of something traumatic like this changing my life forever and having to explain that for the rest of my life is really draughting.

Imagine if you would have believed him, imagine if your daughter would not be as brave she was and told you. 

He would still keep touching her, blaming your daughter for her (understandable) behaviour, turning you against your daughter. 

He is only sorry for getting caught. Trust this. Would he have stopped on his own? It sure doesn't seem like it. How the hell is he so comfortable being sexual around his wife's daughter? His own stepdaughter? He have had many opportunities to stop, but he wanted more and more. 

Imagine you having sexual thoughts about his boys. Imagine fantasizing about them. Stripping them naked with your eyes. That's fucked up and he did that to your daughter! He didn't have any regards for your daughters safety, why should you think of his comfort? Home should be a safe place.

I was years engaged to a rapist/predator and I couldn't accept it  in years because I just couldn't accept being to dumb. Even years after the only thing I regret in life is that I didn't report every little thing I knew. I will forever feel quilty of everything he has ever done.

15373,1hv1tnr,post,Is this SA???,"
I was 7/8/9 at the time and my cousin was around 12/1314. (I dont remember the age i was at this time)

I was very vulnerable as a child which led me to say yes to everything that was asked of me. My cousin would ask me to go to his parents room and would close the door. Once we were alone he would lift my shirt up and rub my nipples and slide his hands down my pants to rub my thighs, sometimes passing them in the leg holes of my underwear and ask if i liked it. 

What makes me doubt if it was is the fact that I said yes. I don’t remember wanting it but as I said i would say yes to everything at the time and i felt very uncomfortable abt it and felt the need to say yes or else he would force me into it like my cousins tend to do when playing board games ect.

I need answers asap, i feel dirty

I don’t remember wanting it but as I said i would say yes to everything at the time and i felt very uncomfortable abt it and felt the need to say yes or else he would force me into it like my cousins tend to do when playing board games ect.

I need answers asap, i feel dirty

15380,1hv25lc,post,i was raped by my friends brother,"this is gonna be so long i just wanna get it all off my chest and be done.

when i was 13 and probably younger i grew up quite quick i was very sexual i used to masturbate loads probably since i was like 10 or something. my mum always told me to go for an older guy (my dad was 8 years older than her) and i always found older guys on tv and in real life hot and i was told how much more mature they were and protective. it just seemed like the most sense to date an older guy. so from primary school i said no to every guy my age who asked me out i think i actually probs told them i like older guys or something stupid lol. but then when i was 12 and started secondary school immediately the first thought i had was i want a boyfriend now. so i downloaded instagram (i feel like i probably already had it but i remeber switching it up). i started posting more ""sexy"" pics (gag as sexy as a 12 year old can be i feel ill saying this lol). i showed my boobs my bum but only through clothes. if anyone asked i always said it was aesthetic. because it was the whole craze of tumblr photos so i just learnt to copy what all the older girls in my school were posting. when that was done i immediately went through and followed all of the older guys who i think were in year 10 at the time. i feel like i maybe liked their photos and then they'd message me and we'd chat and then they'd find out how old i was and they'd stop talking to me. i just want to say i dont know how i feel about me during this time. i know now that i was underage and i actually did not want it. i thought i wanted it but i regret all of them. however i was very persistent i'd try so hard to make someone like me because i just wanted to be loved and so i chased so many older guys.

  
anyways some would stop messaging. until we got to my first ""boyf"" C(15) he stopped for a week and then came back and said he couldn't stop thinking about me. we had to be a secret. long story short we were on and off until i was maybe 15 or 16. i was ALWAYS a secret which made it easier for him to cheat or literally ignore me for 2 weeks at a time at which point i'd spiral and think of all the things i couldve done wrong -- was i too annoying or clingy or did i say something to piss him off. i used to message him loads during those periods until i learnt he'd just break up with me soon after so i'd leave him be silently freaking out until he'd come back and act like nothing happened but then would end it a week later. he'd call me insecure, psycho, boring, mentally ill, too young all of the time and i'd promise i'd change. he'd always come back. i can't even remember what changed but i think at one point we had sex and i didn't feel anything for him anymore at 16 maybe he must've been 18 then and so i never messaged him again. 

C and my dad leaving and my parents terrible relationship full of arguments was what caused me to be depressed and have anxiety since age 13.

anyways during some of the times C and i weren't together id constantly find guys into bdsm on facebook or instagram and constantly send nudes from when i was 13 to maybe 16 i hope i can't even remember. i just remember joking to my friends if they were ever leaked it would be okay because it was underage and they'd be done for it. 

when i was 13-14 i was chatting to L i think he was either 18-19 or 19-20 but he was my ""daddy"" he'd sneak into my house when my parents weren't home and we'd fuck or sometimes he'd sneak me into his like shed house thing at the bottom of his mums garden. he always tasted like bubblegum mint and now i hate the flavour. i stopped talking to him because he messaged my even younger sister if she wanted him to be her daddy too. that was a breaking point. i was so confused and disgusted because my sister was a child! we weren't the same i was grown up and sexual and she was so young (ironically only 11 months younger). i blocked him. he kept messaging me for years until i called him a pedo and he stopped.

when i was 14 i met up with someone who was 21 he was M again i wanted to date and be in love he asked to meet at this park after school immediately he took me to the woods and pulled out his thing and put my hand on it i was so shocked i thought he wanted to date me so i said no thanks i wasn't in a mood so he faked a phone call and left. i was so insanely shaken. that scared me more than the other too.

i didn't have sex again until i was 16 in a relationship with my best friend. i really liked him and got jealous whenever another girl liked him so i thought that meant i wanted him. long story short i didnt i wasn't sexually attracted to him but obviously he expected to have sex. he never pressured me was never horrible. but it was obvious so i did. i have no reccolection of it. i couldn't even tell you what happened. i think he kissed me pushed me on the bed and then boop no memory. i didn't want it at all so i coudln't even tell you what i must've been like. its so embarassing to think of. but he didn't know so it wasn't on him. i never touched him again and we were dating for a year. he was sweet. but i was fully traumatised after that i never had sex again until i was 19. i always thought it was ironic that legally i was raped twice not that i ever count that yet the one time i felt raped it wasn't lol.

i got with a couple guys you know how it is they say they want to date you and they care about you and you find out they don't theyre seeing other people or they're narcissistic. just a bad track record really.

  
but as you can see i've never had a good relationship with men. even my dad who was narcissitic with anger issues and severe paranoia fucked me up a bit even though i love him its complicated lol. but from all of this i was like okay well i know that guys can make me feel good sexually (that was at the point of maybe when i was 20-21) like i like sex in fact i love it i know what i want im confident. the only thing i can't trust is guys with my heart. they will lie and hurt you just to use your body. so i was like cool lets just find someone who loves me.

  
skip forward. im 22 now this year in the summer i went out with people who i thought were my friends the twins S and I and we ended up meeting their brother out. he was so flirty and kind bought everyone drinks. his friend was a dick so L the brother was super protective of us girls. he was two years older than me. he seemed amazing. i got his insta we messaged went on loads of dates. he always told me he's not like the other guys he cares about me and really likes me and doesn't want me for sex. btw i never told him anything lol. i just said men aren't always the nicest to me and that was it. anyways first few times we have sex he lasts 5 secs and doesn't ever even try and turn me on or touch me. as someone who is submissive into bdsm and has had some amazing sex this was horrible. so obviously i said maybe you should try do more stuff. because i was giving him loads of great blowjobs. anyways long story short i go out with his whole family for bottomless brunch and pool. he tells me that night that S's friend's friend accused him of sexual assault once. i was like what??? you??? the guy who waited until i was ready to open up and have sex? i was like omg that's horrible im so sorry. i felt iffy tho. 

that night im very drunk by the end of it because we go out after and he takes me back to mine. we get into bed and he tries to iniate sex which obvs means shoving it in because he doesn't know foreplay. he's had sex with 13 girls ironically. so i said no i don't like having sex without condoms. (he already knows this) i ask if he brought some he said no. so i was like okay then no sex. but then as guys alwayssss do he kisses me more tries to put it in i kinda let him a bit because it feels nice im drunk and ill just tell him no in a bit. (btw i can't have sex without condoms because i get bv so easily and then it lasts months because im super sensitive and it comes back loads so this is a big thing for me the fact i let it carry on was a very drunk move). anyways he stops because he cant stay hard because he's drunk so i was like thank fuck lets go to sleep. i felt a bit weird tho and idk what made me say this maybe as a barrier to protect me like if he saw how difficult opening up to someone and sex can be for me then idk what. but as we were lying down in the dark i cuddled into him in a ball and told him i have a bad relationship with sex because when i was 13 i had sex with a 16 and 19 year old and ive regretted it ever since. idk what he said maybe like aww or something stupid but i went to sleep.

  
the next morning he wakes up we kiss and again he gets on top and tries to put it in and i say stop i dont want sex without a condom. he said well you did it last night and i said i was drunk this isn't something i do i get infections. he kinda stopped then was kissing again this time he manages to shove it in and i was like fucksake okay and said L stop. he didn't. so i was like wtf in my head and said seriously stop and put my hand on his chest about to shove him off. but he stopped after one more pump.

i was like wtf he really really almost didn't listen to my second no in fact he didnt listen to my first no. i was a bit shaken but i didn't wanna cause a scene. its confusing to get into but we were only dating for like 3 months not that long i didnt love him i wasnt even attracted to him. but i wanted to be so bad because he kept telling me i'm trying to chuck something normal and healthy away because of past trauma so i was like that makes sense so i kept trying to like him. i ended it with him once and he convinced me to carry on dating he even said he loved me which was crazy we'd only been on like 5 dates at the time. but anyways i didn't wanna make a deal and seem like im trying to end it again.

  
he lied down next to me and said he really wants sex so i said me too but we dont have condoms. fun fact i did. idk why or how but something inside of me was saying don't show him condoms. i think because i wanted him to show me he can foreplay without sex etc. anyways i said to him we don't need to have sex we can do other stuff and i smiled up at him. so he said other stuff like what? so i said confused but flirty you know other stuff. it was awkward i felt weird about what just happened and as a sub its sometimes difficult to ask especially when doms just ""do"" you know? plus we werent 12 we both know what other stuff means when ive told him foreplay is important before. 

  
anyways he gives me this smirk. which genuinely haunts me. he flipped me over on the bed lifted my bum up and shoved himself in. i was so shocked i thought it was a joke like because he smiled before like he was planning something fun something id enjoy so i thought oh this is a joke and he'll eat me out instead or something. but he didn't he kept doing it and i just kept waiting i was so confused. i just told him i never have sex without condoms and that i don't want sex without condoms and i want to do other stuff. i was just frozen and confused and then he came and i came out of it and was like wtf did you just come in me??? this is another thing i hate the way guys always want sex without condoms because it feels better for him and will just pull out i hate it which is why im against it. i was so scared he'd come inside me but he promsied hed pulled oout but i couldnt see because he was behind me. so i kept reaching back and i was just so fucking shocked. i think i took the tissue off him and cleaned myself up.

  
he fell back assleep probs till like 2 pm at which point id showered cried my eyes out for an hour and messaged my sister asking what had just happened because i felt so violated but he was so normal. eventually i woke him up and i said can you shower he did and then i took the condoms out the drawer and laid with them in the bed. idk why i wanted to patch up what just happened i wanted good sex to make it so he wouldnt leave again with me feeling weird or like i dont like him. i didnt wanna seem off with him so i thought this was best. i wanted control back maybe? idk i've never psychoanalysed it but it deffo has made coming to terms with what happened extremely hard.

  
is it rape if i ask for sex after? is it rape if i don't fight back? is it rape if i don't say no in the moment?

  
i don't fucking know.

  
we fucked it didnt help. i told him in person i didnt want it when we were cuddling and he opened one eye said hes sorry and then closed it.

  
there's so much that has happened after. i ended it with him. he's turned up at my house drops gifts and letters off even when i tell him to leave me alone. his sisters told me im making this serious. i am struggling so fucking much mentally i feel like my brain is splitting in too. i feel so ridiculous for being so traumatised when it wasn't violent and i reacted weird after. 

i have flashbacks constantly, more frequent panic attacks (i hadn't had one since i was in sixthform) more deppressive episodes i cant come out of i have nightmares every night even if i take sleeping tabelts they just keep me trapped in them without waking up. im gonna fail my degree.

if anyone actually read all this i might talk about the rest but i feel so drained i have a headache so bye thanks for reading if you did.","i was raped by my friends brother this is gonna be so long i just wanna get it all off my chest and be done.

He said a lot of things that were very self-pitying but he’s honestly just sort of like that in general. And I thought he would change but 2 years later and he SAed me again.

I blocked him and removed him from a discord server without telling anyone in the server except one person. One of my friends realized a few days later and messaged him asking why he “left.” I don’t know exactly what he said but my friend told me he said he touched me inappropriately in a sexual manner. He literally just told her? I hadn’t told her anything either so this is his wording. Most would downplay it or lie or make an excuse, not say something like this knowing that she would cut him out of her life (which she has). 

The above quote in the title is something my other friend told me when I told him what he had said. I learned to never expect an apology or admission (especially to other people) from people who hurt me like this because I knew it would never come, I expected all the excuses and downplaying and refusal to admit any fault so they could protect themselves/their reputation. I even expected the blame to be turned on me. I never really expected this.

it’s a hard conversation to approach, but sometimes, you just have to jump right into it. if the two of you are spending time together just say hey, can i talk to you about something serious? or send her that in a text if you would like to have the conversation over text, potentially to have a supportive friend with you if you’re scared about her response. remember that you don’t have to go into any more detail than you are comfortable sharing. you can simply say that you were recently raped/assaulted if that’s all you feel comfortable sharing. say what support you need from her. i recommend opening up about how you’ve felt guilty in these last few days, because that is the part that affects the relationship the most directly.

i wish you the best of luck. it’s not your fault, even if you had the “physical advantage.” i used to beat myself up about not fighting back, but i have come to understand that the guilt lies only with the perpetrator. i went to an emergency therapy session that made a HUGE difference in my feelings of guilt and self-blame, so if you have any counseling available, i highly recommend it."," first, i am so sorry. that is such a horrible thing to go through. it is NOT your fault, you are not filthy, and you are so deserving of love. second, i do recommend you talk to your gf. you love her and want to continue this relationship, and i don’t think you’d be able to (or want to) hide this from her. if she blames you, then SHE doesn’t deserve YOU.

Many of us had that happen with our bodies. It's an extremely painful experience, and it deserves the amount of privacy that makes you most comfortable for working through the aftermath. It's no one's business but your own."," It's up to you, but it's not your fault, and you are under no obligation to tell him.

As far as to why you feel you didn’t do more, my therapist told me it is a way for our bodies to protect us when it perceives danger. So our bodies knowing our environment and our weaknesses choose Fight, Flight, Freeze, or Fawn. Crying and not fighting is a part of Freezing. And acting normal around a predator is another stress response that’s a part of the fawn response. 

Your body did what it had to do to protect yourself throughout and it still is. You did nothing wrong. 

All the best to you."," I’m really sorry, OP. For what it’s worth, you did nothing wrong. Nothing to deserve it.

Especially because I only remember them being against me I don't remember how they got there, I just remember I definitely didn't explicitly content.

I understand where you're coming from, and I'm genuinely sorry for your own personal situation, but I doubt it's a flashback. I have 0 history of sexual assault other than whatever this is, 0 visual memory, 0 memory of an age or what they looked or sounded like or anything.

16800,m7bqp8m,comment,,"I used to think so. I was in a sexually abusive relationship for years. Every time he did it, he would tell me some bs like “your beauty possesses me to do it”, “you’re so beautiful, how could I not?” or “I love you so much, I just can’t keep my hands off you”. 

I used to cry afterwards in the first few months and he would guilt me about it because I’m making him feel like he’s a monster for loving me as much as he does. I believed him. He was so convincing, he made me feel like I was ungrateful and like I was overreacting. I was 16 when we started dating and till this day, it’s the only relationship I’ve ever been in.

16803,1i267d0,post,I think my friend SA’d me,"Before you read, if you think you saw this post before you probably did. This is a repost to gain more attention. 

So for context, I was 14 at the time and he was 17 (We’re gonna call him Brayden). We were hanging out as friends with my sister and his best friend (who we’re gonna call Jacob). (I know I shouldn’t be but) we already had sex the day before, and I had 100% agreed, but the next day my sister and I had smoked before we went to see them, and I was completely gone. I didn’t know where I was, where we were going, or just couldn’t comprehend the conversation at hand. I made it known that I was high, but even if I didn’t I feel like it would’ve been obvious because I could barely walk or talk correctly.  

After our meet up, the boys had told us that they had a place in mind (and we trusted them) near Jacob’s house which happened to be near my house, so we agreed. When we got on the bus, I was sure that I was gonna be okay by the end of the bus ride, but I was still fucked up. When we got to the spot it seemed unfamiliar so I checked my location, and it was near my house but not the direction I was thinking about. 

We all sat down in this broken down spot of the place we were at, and we were talking before my sister and Jacob disappeared, and it was just Brayden and I. Brayden pulled me onto his lap (and he was holding me because I couldn’t sit up by myself), and started talking about how horny and hard he was, so I said “No, I’m too high. I don’t want to do this right now,”. After I told him that, he took my hand, and placed it on his penis (over his clothes), before he started grinding into my hand so I said “I don’t know, I’m super high,”. He started to kiss me, and unbuckle his pants before putting my hand into his pants, and grinding again while laughing. I started asking where my sister was, because I was uncomfortable and wanted her to come save me from the awkward situation, and he said “No, Jacob knows what’s going on. We only came here, so I could fuck,”, so at that point I look up at him and say “Wait, what? For real?”, and he nods. 

After that, he pulls my skirt up and starts touching me. I push him off, but it was weak so I’m not sure if he knew I was trying to push him off or not. He stood up, and pulled his penis fully out, and told me to suck it. I ended up doing it, because nobody was around to get me out of that situation, and we ended up having sex. 

At first, I didn’t think much of it until I told my sister what happened, and she was just apologizing that that happened to me. I also told my other sister about it, and she said “Oh my gosh, you were raped. I’m so sorry that happened to you. I want to kill him,”. Both of these conversations either happened today or yesterday, and this incident happened back in October. 

PS: He was sober the whole time, and also smokes. He knows what too much does to you. ALSO this was not a “2man”. We knew Brayden for months before this, and my sister had a boyfriend.","I think my friend SA’d me Before you read, if you think you saw this post before you probably did.

16826,1i28mks,post,i keep seeking attention from unsafe men in hopes of triggering memories of my assault ,"i was doing so well with healthy coping mechanisms, but now i feel like i’m doing a 180. i was making art and writing and listening to music. i was so proud of myself. but then i had a flashback that caused a seizure and everything just changed. i started putting myself into unsafe situations with men online (again). i know that they want to hurt me, but i feel like it’s what i deserve. like it’s what i’m good for. i make them happy. i have to let them hurt me to make them happy. i aim to please i guess lol
i think i know why i do this but i don’t want to do it anymore. or at least i know it’s not helping me. i used to think being consumed by men made me valid. attention is nice. i think i’m just stuck in a pattern of things i don’t believe in and that i don’t think anyone else deserves. by the time i was 12, i was groomed to think that my body was all i was worth and that it’d be a compliment to be hurt. i don’t really believe that at all, but sometimes i still feel like a child thinking that if a man hurts or degrades or humiliates me that means that they love me. 
i know that these men are getting off on my pain and it does repulse me, but i can’t shake the feeling that it’s what i’m worth or what makes me useful.

16830,1i299bi,post,"Got sexually assaulted at 14, proper fucked me up","Got sexually assaulted at 14 thought I'd share (the worst 3 days of my life)

When I was 14 I got sexually assaulted by a girl I met on holiday. She started off nice and was all flirty which obviously made a teenage boy feel good. She was 16 or so but far more mature than me. 

The first incident happened when she beckoned me into the ocean and flirted a bit before putting a hand down my trunks. 
Apparently she didn't like what she found there (I was 14 idk what she expected) and proceeded to insult me and squeeze 'me'. From there she scratched and slapped 'me' as well as mocking me physically the whole way through. She finished it off saying that if I told anyone she'd claim I raped her instead

Once it was finally over I went to find my family, seek refuge if you will, and had dinner. I told nobody. The next day, I thought it was behind and we went down to the beach again. I realised that I'd forgotten to put suncream on my back and shoulders so I went to the toilet to do. This woman somehow managed to Houdini her way in. This meant I was locked in a closed room with her.

What ensued was even worse. She kicked, punched, scratched, slapped, scratched and kneed me. I didn't scream - I thought she'd claim I hurt her and I'd be the villain. So is at there and took it. Then the verbal abuse started again. Fat, small dick, worthless, ugly, and a lot more than that. I'm worthless, I'll never find love, I don't deserve love, if I get a partner she'll just cheat on me and finally that I should just kill myself.

Once all that had finished and she'd left I turned to put my suncream on before thinking a frankly stupid plan. I didn't put suncream on, 40°C in Cyprus in the middle of summer for a whole day. I got second degree sunburns. This did work as an excuse to not go out, the initial plan, but it was also brutal corporal pain constantly. Again, I told no one of the ordeal.

The final issue is the third day of the story - which I spent sat in a hotel room alone just thinking, and she'd given me a lot to think about. I looked at myself in the mirror and felt sick, I thought about myself and felt disgusted but the main thing that kept coming back was that I'm worthless. And I should kill myself. And so I found the balcony and stood there, teetering, and contemplating everything until finally a made a decision.

I obviously stepped down and went inside, not out of self love or logical self preservation no, but spite. I didn't want to give her the satisfaction of knowing she'd given me those issues so I stayed.

Since then I've thinned down, look better and other things but I've still got issues from it - wild self worth issues and a crippling fear of being cheated on.

I did tell some people, some friends and my girlfriend. Only one person 'betrayes' me, telling someone else and changing the story so it sounded good for me. Kinda hate the guy ngl.

He maliciously prepared the bathroom (unlocked the windows) so he could then open the windows to sneak his phone through and record me. I only noticed when I got out and was drying myself. He had the flash on and as soon as I saw, I ran to the window and slammed it shut. He did it on our mother’s birthday. I can no longer view her birthday as a good day, or something to celebrate, it’s just a reminder of what happened. 

I can no longer form any sort of relationship with a man, whether that be a friendship or whatever. I simply cannot trust them. 
There was instances when we were really young, (for example at the time I was basically newborn and he was 5/6) he would look into my nappy and touch me. My mum caught him in the act. I was only told a few years ago. 

After my brother had recorded me naked, I freaked out (as anyone would). I immediately told my parents, and they originally blamed the neighbours son, but as soon as he was ruled out, they asked my brother and he admitted to it straight away. No legal action was taken, and as a 13 year old I didn’t even know how to approach the situation, let alone make a report. It ruined me. My parents got angry at me for not forgiving him, blamed me, and scrutinised me. I am still forced to live with him, I am still forced into silence for reputation sake.

One night we were discussing our trauma and pasts with each other. This is where i told him about a time when i was 13 when someone forced me online to send pics “or …” and was threatening me in a bunch of different ways. I told my boyfriend that the words “you must … or …” were used multiple times. 

Later on that night, i was in and out of a dissociative state (sometimes I don’t remember when I am dissociated and my bf knows this) and at one point my boyfriend started saying those exact words i was telling him about earlier to try and get me to touch him (sexually) and make him finish. He was saying “you must not stop until you finish … or …” over and over again. When he said those words i was shocked to my core and wondering what was going on. then I thought to myself that he must’ve been thinking that I was dissociated and out of it (so wouldn’t remember what he was trying to do) and was trying to trick me into taking me back to that place in my mind from my childhood in hopes that it triggers me enough to force me into touching him. He even went as far as saying “I’m (then said the name of the guy from instagram that forced me with I was younger that I had told him about earlier) and you must not stop until you finish”. It wasn’t working because obviously I wasn’t actually dissociated so I kept stopping every few seconds and I was conscious the entire time however I was too stunned at what he was trying to do to me that I just went with it, expecting him to stop and realise what he was doing, but he didn’t. This went on the entire night. He tried it in different tones, triggering me, all sorts of ways. Every time he seen that I wasn’t actually out of it, he pulled his shorts back up, thinking I had no idea what was going on. I was disgusted at what I was seeing but I didn’t want to say anything because I wanted to see what his intentions were with him continuously trying to force me to touch him and how far we was taking this. This went on for a good while through the night. Eventually, he tried it in an even more aggressive tone, same words, same sentence. This time however, I was on my knees and his hands were on my head and his dick was in my face and he kept saying it to me over and over again. I don’t know if it went in my mouth or not, but all I know is that I was just so shocked at what he was trying to do to me the entire night. Especially because he was using my childhood trauma to take advantage for his own pleasure.

I phoned him 2 weeks later and he admitted it and said he doesn’t know why he done it and that it was the worst thing he has ever done in his life. He classed it as assault.

16853,1i2d2m4,post,Feelings of hopelessness after SA,"This is just a bit of a rant and asking for advice. I (19F) have been sexually assaulted 7 times (different individuals) throughout my childhood up until I turned 18 and it has left me with a lot of trauma.

My first time feeling fully safe around men was when I was 18 and moved to university. I started to display a lot of hypersexuality, dissociating, trust issues and low self esteem (particularly driven by a desire for male validation).
Upon realising this I did a lot of internal work for 2 years, journalling, reading self help books and undergoing CBT therapy. Yet, I still have a subconscious desire for male validation, alongside low self esteem and anxiety surrounding abandonment and love and it’s making me feel very guilty and like a bad person in general. I have lost so many friends due to my trust issues and desire for validation and I feel so lonely. During first year of university, I was used by a guy in my friendship group for sex and it triggered those hypersexual feelings and made me spiral. I entertained flirting with a couple of other (single) guys in the group and the entire group turned against me and kicked me out of the housing plans for the following year without telling me, leaving me with worsened trust issues too.

I had always felt hopeful about my future and my ability to heal but, recently, particularly with the feelings of loneliness, I feel so hopeless and overwhelmed by my trauma. I feel hopeless that, despite all this work and effort, I am still struggling with these issues and internal critical thoughts. I’m scared that I will never be a properly functioning person, and I just feel broken. 

I don’t know where to go from here and the overwhelm has been making me battle suicidal thoughts - “I’m never getting out of this”, “What’s the point in living”, etc. Even though I have no intention to act on them, I am crippled by fear that this will be my reality forever.","Feelings of hopelessness after SA This is just a bit of a rant and asking for advice.

16869,1i2eoeo,post,Thinking about an assault from 5 years ago via a man I trusted,"The first time I met him, I was visibly flinching and nervous and he seemed like he was making a conscious effort to make sure I felt comfortable around him. He looked like he felt bad if he caused me discomfort in the slightest 

Fast forward to the last time we hooked up, we were having anal and it was hurting me. The moment I said ""ow"" he lit up with a GIANT GRIN and continued to thrust. Then he stopped and in the most fake concerned voice said "" awwww did that hurt????""

I also didn't feel comfortable having PIV sex with him since he didn't have a condom. But he would randomly slip it in without my consent and say ""it's YOUR choice. It's what YOU want"" When I told him to stop, he pulled out but THEN would nag me to let him back in. 

There was a previous incident where we had anal and I bled. I didn't realize until I got home. However, I'm 90 percent sure, he saw me bleed and said nothing. There were moments during that encounter when we would do other things, and when I would tell him it felt good, he would randomly get angry, stop what he was doing, and only do things that pleasure him. But when I made it clear I wanted to go home, he would suddenly start trying to pleasure me to get on my good side. It was the strangest thing. I'm glad I stopped seeing him.

I was so taken aback by how he came off as caring and then ..... suddenly became the opposite. 

Why do men enjoy seeing women in pain?","Thinking about an assault from 5 years ago via a man I trusted The first time I met him, I was visibly flinching and nervous and he seemed like he was making a conscious effort to make sure I felt comfortable around him.

16883,1i2g921,post,Was this SA? ,"I'm here to ask if this situation was sexual abuse, or sexual assault, or neither. 

About a year ago, I got into a relationship with another woman my age and the relationship was unstable. We'd fight constantly and I'd usually be the one to dismiss how I felt to diffuse the arguments. She was hyper-sexual and had anger issues. I don't hold it against anyone who experiences hypersexuality or anger issues, but the way she handled them with me wasn't the best. As someone who has PTSD, one of my triggers is being yelled at, and she would be quick to anger, lashing out when things didn't go her way. I constantly tried pleasing her on multiple occasions throughout the relationship to avoid confrontation. However, these actions would also happen during intimate actions. For some much needed context, this was a long distance relationship, so nothing intimate happened physically. Before getting into my relationship with my ex, the thought of sex was indifferent to me and I didn't experience many sexual urges, I was asexual beforehand and didn't mind the idea of sex. However, from as soon as a month into our relationship, my ex would make sexual advances which I would enjoy, but when it came to actual intimate actions, I started to become uncomfortable. Since we were long distance, we would call on the phone and please ourselves together, talking and getting eachother off, things like that. Furthermore, usually I was the one to help my ex, by encouraging her on the phone. I enjoyed it at first until it became a daily thing. Once my ex realized I didn't mind having sex, she wanted it all the time. Combined with being afraid on how I'd perform and not wanting to disappoint her, both out of the fear of being yelled at or given the silent treatment, I complied. Some sexual experiences I did enjoy, however most of them I was too mentally drained to enjoy since we were fighting every day (this isn't an exaggeration). It seemed to me the only way to make her happy and avoid stressful situations was in the bedroom. I would also like to add that whenever I expressed I was too tired to perform, she would become upset with me and get frustrated.

Now, out of the relationship I realize I struggle a lot more with sexual topics, and it often makes me uncomfortable to think of having sex with an intimate partner. I don't know if I may be overplaying how I feel, or if I genuinely am experiencing feelings of it.

Any comments or thoughts would be appreciated, I'm willing to answer any questions regarding the situation. However, my mind is very blurry from the beginning to end of the relationship. I will try my best, but I can't say I remember a lot of it. ","Was this SA?  I'm here to ask if this situation was sexual abuse, or sexual assault, or neither. 

About a year ago, I got into a relationship with another woman my age and the relationship was unstable. We'd fight constantly and I'd usually be the one to dismiss how I felt to diffuse the arguments. She was hyper-sexual and had anger issues. I don't hold it against anyone who experiences hypersexuality or anger issues, but the way she handled them with me wasn't the best. As someone who has PTSD, one of my triggers is being yelled at, and she would be quick to anger, lashing out when things didn't go her way. I constantly tried pleasing her on multiple occasions throughout the relationship to avoid confrontation. However, these actions would also happen during intimate actions. For some much needed context, this was a long distance relationship, so nothing intimate happened physically. Before getting into my relationship with my ex, the thought of sex was indifferent to me and I didn't experience many sexual urges, I was asexual beforehand and didn't mind the idea of sex. However, from as soon as a month into our relationship, my ex would make sexual advances which I would enjoy, but when it came to actual intimate actions, I started to become uncomfortable. Since we were long distance, we would call on the phone and please ourselves together, talking and getting eachother off, things like that.

i want to be careful with what i say, because i don't want to make you feel any sort of way if you've made peace with your situation. but by definition of british law, being coerced into sex is considered rape.

obviously, rape is penetration without consent. but there are several exceptions to 'without consent'. essentially meaning, if they did give consent, but one of the following factors are also true, the consent was not true:

their age, maturity and understanding; 

whether s/he knew or understood the position they were in and what they were being asked to do;

the history of the relationship between the complainant and suspect;

position of power over the complainant; and, especially for younger and/or vulnerable victims;

any earlier provision by the suspect of any gifts, alcohol or drugs;

insincere compliments and/or kindness shown by the suspect;

any other evidence of exploitation or grooming so that s/he may not understand the full significance of what they are doing.

16909,1i2ijcu,post,Was this sa??? Pls someone answer im really stressed ,This has been bothering me for a year please someone help. Around March 2024 I was getting with a guy who showed a lot of interest like always telling me I’m the most beautiful girl he’s seen and how much he likes everything about me. Before the first time we hooked up I told him I don’t have sex with guys I’m not dating and my previous experiences with sex were painful. After I told him that kept asking the first time we hooked up and I said no but he didn’t do anything. The second time we hooked up I again told him before that I don’t have sex with guys I’m not dating and mentioned again how it was really painful for me. While we were hooking up he kept asking to have sex and I kept saying no. Eventually he just kind of stuck it in and I moved and he said “that felt good didn’t it?” And I said “no it hurt”. After that he  did it again and we ended up having sex. But I’m really confused for a few reasons; I was naked on top of him and other stuff was happening. I get worried that maybe I was the one to acc put it in and I’m just playing victim. After we started he told me we could stop if i wanted (even tho he pressured me into it even if it wasn’t fully assault). We were drinking and I’m just confused it really upsets me not knowing more than anything. Idk this has just been bothering me forever and I feel guilty classifying it as assault bc it didn’t like severely traumatize me and it wasn’t violent ,Was this sa???

You said no to a particular sex act twice and he continued to push your boundaries out of sexual frustration by the sounds of it.

You stop the activity for a bit and restate your boundary. He is following your lead and consent at this point.

You then continue ""hooking up"" (I don't hook up without vaginal so that term is also confusing to me, mouth, and hands i guess. But then how are you ontop of him later in missionary)

Coercion and acceptance of an act without clear mutual consent Is SA technically.


But then I re read it again and the situation is so in the moment you don't know if you slid onto him or not and he asks you after that happens if you would like to stop.


You don't want to stop or don't communicate with the partner that you do want to stop. You've both been drinking. 


You then continue to have sex after multiple hook ups and multiple sexual interactions. 


I can see how this guy has no clue how you're feeling about the issue and has no clue you're even thinking about the concept of SA personally.



..


Technically the point where he puts it in for a moment to test your boundaries is SA at the start of the evening because of lack of mutual consent. 

But then the rest of the instance all has your actions demonstrating to him you are understanding of the boundary cross and still wishing to engage in sexual activities. 

The instance even has him reaffirming consent with you later to check what's happening is OK.



To Me this is Schroedingers sex. It both has SA and no SA based on who's looking in the box.


This feels like the guy is testing boundaries but also not a rapist and is trying to follow your consent guidelines to me.

16955,1i2l9ms,post,I was SA’D by a close friend. ,"Daniel, a close friend of mine, was someone I deeply trusted. During college, we worked together often, hung out regularly, and even shared personal traumas, including my past experiences with sexual assault. That trust is why his actions hurt me so deeply.

One night, during a group drinking session, Daniel— who doesn't drink or smoke—joined us as usual. Afterward, we went to a senior's room to rest. I went to bed first because I was feeling dizzy. The next morning, I woke up groggy and still hungover to find Daniel lying next to me. Half-asleep, I felt him kiss me, and in my disoriented state, I briefly kissed him back before fully realizing what was happening. Shocked, I got up and sat in a chair, frozen. The room was silent, and I realized we were alone. He soon acted like he had just woken up and left.

In the days after, I felt betrayed, heartbroken, and confused. I avoided him at all costs, and seeing him made me tremble with anxiety. I couldn't focus on my work and often broke down in tears. I told a trusted senior, who encouraged me to confront him. Eventually, with support from others, I did. When I asked him why he kissed me, he admitted that he thought I wouldn't mind and saw me as ""easy."" His words left me shattered.

After the incident, most people distanced themselves from him. But recently, l've noticed him reconnecting with classmates. I found out he's been telling people the incident was consensual because I kissed him back. This hurts me deeply.

I keep wondering: How could he do this to me, knowing | was drunk and vulnerable? How could he assume l'd be okay with it? And how can others still be friends with someone who would take advantage of their own friend like that? It breaks my heart to see him welcomed back.","I was SA’D by a close friend.

What's the point of being in a relationship with someone you love if you can't casually see if someone wants some naughty fun ...


When the other person isn't specifically in the mood, it's pretty normal for the horny one to try and tease their partner and turn them on to see if they can get them in the mood.


You use safe words in relationships. 

Green = Go. Red = Hard stop. Yellow = Ease up but let's keep playing.


It's also pretty normal to have situations where during the night a partner tests to see if their sleepy or sleeping partner is up for fun.

16969,1i2m2mk,post,What do I do now? ,"I've had bad experiences with men in the past. I've had relationships where I was psychologically abused, with people who had tendency to violence. But I have never felt as desperate and afraid as I felt that night.

I was at a colleague's husband's birthday dinner. I loved my colleague very much and knew her husband too, they were like a big sister and brother to me. They had this friend whom they very much trusted and told me he'd give me a ride home. Throughout the dinner we flirted, he was about 10 years older than me and he was nicer than anyone I've ever met. He was kind, funny, such a gentleman. 

At the end of the night he told me he'd give me a ride home just as planned. I said goodbye to my colleague and her husband and they told him that they trusted him with me. He said of course and we took a cab. He kissed me on the way and asked me if he could come over. I said yes, thinking that it was time I've been with a man who was kind and got his shit together, who had a career and could take care of himself. We got home and started having sex, during he tried to have anal but I stopped him. This happened more than 6 or 7 times, he tried without asking me and as the number of attempts and his use of force increased I started to get scared. He was forcing his way and my voice started trembling, I called his name with as much confidence as I could gather and said I didn't want to continue, with a lot of talking I finally managed to get out of bed and that's when he started to get angry. 

My first instinct as always in these situations was to calm him down, I told him it wasn't his fault, I was the problem. I was so afraid he would do something to me because he was getting louder and angrier by the minute. But this didnt work either, he kept telling me I was apparently r*ped before, this could be the only explanation for my actions. He kept wanting to talk to which I said I didn't want to anymore and that I wanted him to go and leave me alone. He stayed. He stayed for so long, I can't even remember how long. He accused me of using drugs, he said that's why I'm acting this way. He said he wasn't one of the men who paid me and that's why I'm acting this way. That I wasn't used to not getting money in exchange for sex. He said that I was a crazy person and he didn't give two shits about me but was worried I would do something to myself after he's gone and he would have to deal with it. He told me my colleague and her husband wouldn't believe me, that they were his friends and I was clearly a crazy drug addict. At this point my eyes started to water and I told him that if he kept staying I would call the cops. He said that I was the one who invited him, that he would prove everything and nobody would believe me. He was yelling so loudly during all this and was raising his hand in an attempt to hit me at different times, he never did but I think he was trying to scare me into the thought that he could do that if he wanted to. 

He dialed 911 on his phone and showed it to me, told me let's see who they would rather believe, me or him. I begged him to go, that I didn't want to go through this anymore and I would call him a cab if he left, would even pay for it. He stopped dialing and yelled some more, I covered my ears because I couldn't deal with it anymore. He got dressed and lit up a cigarette and asked me without any hint of shame if he could smoke his cig, with a mocking tone in his voice. I stayed silent, and as he was saying more horrible things to me something flipped in my head. I told him to take his cigarette outside, take all his belongings and get out of my house immediately. He said that he didn't know the area and told me to get a cab, but I was freaking out so I think he got a little scared. He then gathered his things, told me to get out of the couch because he didn't trust me and that I could have stolen something. I just wanted him gone at that point, I was so scared and desperate. He put on his shoes, I held my cat in my arms in an attempt to protect it from him, opened the door, told him he was a sick son of a bitch and slammed the door behind him. Locked the door as much as I could and just had a complete breakdown.

I deactivated my instagram account, blocked him everywhere and the day after I noticed he was texting my colleague telling her he was sick and had to go to the hospital that night. I figured he was trying to find out if I had said anything to anyone. Yesterday I think he wanted to meet them outside, which I also think is an attempt to see if anybody knows anything.

I can't forget the things he said, his threats, accusations he made about me, the smell of cigarettes on him, his perfume, it all comes back to me at random times and I don't know if I can ever feel normal again. I haven't told anyone except my best friend. I can't talk to my colleague because I'm so afraid they wouldn't believe me or blame me. I'm acting as nothing happened at work, but at the same time I'm scared he'll tell them with intent to gain control on the story and they will believe him because I'm acting normal. I'm also trying to convince myself he won't because then he would be the one driving attention to it. 

Now, I don't know what to do. I blame myself for everything. I want to forget everything that happened, I want to go back to my normal life. I'm tired of looking over my shoulder to see if he's back for some revenge or something. I don't know if I'm irrational. I just don't know what to do. ","What do I do now?

16975,m7foj07,comment,,"Being kissed without consent counts as sexual assault. You told me to Google the definition of sexual assault and here’s what I found. 

“The overall definition of sexual or indecent assault is an act of physical, psychological and emotional violation in the form of a sexual act, inflicted on someone without their consent. It can involve forcing or manipulating someone to witness or participate in any sexual acts. Not all cases of sexual assault involve violence, cause physical injury or leave visible marks. Sexual assault can cause severe distress, emotional harm and injuries which can’t be seen – all of which can take a long time to recover from. This is why we use the term ‘assault’, and treat reports just as seriously as those of violent, physical attacks.” (Metropolitan Police UK)

It's inappropriate for the guy to kiss you without your consent , especially with the variables of alcohol...

It is gross that he tries to kiss you whilst you were hungover / still drunk in the morning.

The things he says about you being into it later make him a complete and utter deuche bag.

The crossing of boundaries and mutual consent occurred,  correct.

17014,1i2smpc,post,what happened?? ,"For reference, me and my boyfriend are both traumatized. We both have our own past with abusive relationships. And were both autistic and he tends to have a problem reading body emotions.. If that matters.. 

Weve been dating over 2 years

Summary i guess 

He wanted to top, and im not very used to it despite being a switch. Its very unusual for him to top so i never really expected it from him, which we both understood and agreed on.

I told him he could, and i said ""be easy with me, okay? Go slowly"" and he said he would

He started very fast, with thrown in dirty talk aswell. I stopped him and moved his hand slower, as if like showing him. I told him to be slow again

He went slow for maybe 3 seconds and then sped up again. I closed my legs and he opened them again for me forcefully. I guess in any other context itd be hot but i was VISIBLY uncomfortable. He wouldnt stop so i thought maybe hed notice and slow down. 
I told him to be slow AGAIN

He didnt, he kept going really fast, i tried tapping him but i couldnt, i couldnt close my legs because he was literally inside me. 

I think i pulled him close and told him to be slow again, and it was really nice. I was being more expressive and clearly more into it. But it lasted maybe 5 seconds

He pulled back and went really fast again, and i gave up

I went limp and figured if i let it happen i would start to like it more. I went kind of quiet and he didnt seem to notice

It rly bothers me he didnt even notice i was uncomfortable 

i came? I think? And it hit like a TRUCK and i started shaking and crying and it sent me into a whole panic attack. 

He held me and asked if i was okay and eventually, when i could breathe again, i said yes. 

I didnt want to worry him, or make him think he did a bad job, so i said i was okay. I told him ""it was fine,, just to fast,,"" and he said ""okay,,"" 

Like 6 months later i cant stop thinking about it, i keep dreaming of it and getting scared of the thought. I have 2 friends tell me it sounds like borderline SA

I bring it up to him, and he panics and asks if im going to break up with him, i tell him ""no ofc not"" and he seems to calm down. And then that was it. He said ""sorry"" and that was pretty much it.. 

Later i find in his notes app that he vented in, he says something like ""you told me you were okay its not my fault""

And i dont understand.. I really dont know what this is. 

I said slow, i closed my legs, i had a fuckin panic attack, and i stopped him multiple times during it.

When I was in grad school I started “dating” another person in my program. We met very early on, within our very first week. 

I had moved 1100 miles to go to grad school there, so I didn’t know anyone in or around the area. (This was intentional, because I had a pretty traumatic childhood and wanted to put some physical distance between it and em.) 

Sometimes it’s hard for me to build lasting friendships because I’m autistic. But I’ve always been able to at least make causal, Level 1 friendships (i.e. people who would invite me to group hangouts or who I could talk to about everyday things, but who I probably wouldn’t confide deeper stuff in), and this is often good enough for me. 

Anyway, X and I met on a dating app before either of us realized we were in the same program. (I met the other students in our cohort at a TA orientation but X didn’t get a teaching assistantship in our major department and instead TAed for another department. Also, we weren’t in the same seminars, so I hadn’t seen them around.) This is important because it meant no one knew we even knew each other, which X liked. They told me they liked to keep relationships under wraps for the first few weeks because that’s what made them comfortable. They had only been in one relationship before and kind of felt embarrassment around dating. 

I didn’t have a problem with that, plus I wanted them to be comfortable. However, when they told me that, we hadn’t had the dating talk. We’d only gone on one hike together (and spent the evening afterwards together, not in a sexual way) and this secret conversation came a week later. At the time, though, I didn’t even think to point out we’d only been on one date (though neither of us had called it a date). When I later tried to bring this up, just for clarification to understand what we were doing and what we both wanted, they would change the subject, to the point of them being upset. Then I would feel bad for making them upset and apologized for bringing it up. They always seemed happier after this, when I was comforting them. 

I didn’t have much of a romantic interest in them at them time . I swiped right on them for 2 reasons: I’m trans and used to have a personal policy where I always swiped right on other trans people in camaraderie and because, even if me and the person I swiped right on didn’t hit it off, I’m always down for more trans friends (I grew up in a very small town in the Deep South, so I hadn’t had many trans friends before). 

So I really wanted to be just friends with X. I didn’t feel like we were compatible romantically but we did get along and would be seeing each other around campus, so I really wanted to tell them how I felt and express what I needed, only they would never let me. They would always guilt me into pushing my wants/needs aside in favor of their. At first I didn’t think they were doing this intentionally. In fact I convinced myself I was just overthinking things. 

I’m always hard on myself for being autistic and assume that I’m always misunderstanding something where neurotypical people are concerned. 

In an effort to help communication be clearer on both sides I told X that I’m autistic and the tried to explain what that means to me and for me, as well as what I felt it might mean for our conversations, but they were always so quick to cut me off and say they knew what autism was. I tried to explain that it’s different for different people but they just kept dismissing that and essentially saying that *I* was the one who wasn’t understanding the spectrum. (Without prompting, X said they were neurotypical but that they read a lot and was very interested in “disability studies”.) 

So again I apologized for the confusion and, once again, abandoned the friend conversation. 

This went on for some time. Every time I tried to talk to them about my needs and wants they would either dismiss what I said, guilt me into pursuing a relationship with them, manipulating me, and, sometimes, just getting up and walking away whenever I started talking. 

I didn’t feel like I knew anyone around me well enough to go to with this, plus I kept taking all of the blame, so I just told myself I needed to be different. That I just needed to be more fair to them. (Much of what I know and understand now was gleaned only from retrospect.)

Within a month I had pretty much given up on just being friends and accepted that we were in a relationship, which meant I definitely couldn’t talk to anyone what I was going through now, as I took their secret rule very literally (they told me I couldn’t tell anyone anything that might suspect we were dating). And this last well beyond the first few weeks. What’s more, it wasn’t just that people couldn’t know we were dating, it was like X didn’t even want people to know we knew each other. Whenever our cohort had group outings, which naturally included carpooling, X and I were never allowed to carpool together. We literally lived 1.2 miles from each other. Everyone else lived at least 8 miles from us. But X would always either require us to drive separate cars or they would have one of the others come to pick them up. 

If we went somewhere together I was never allowed to make any kind of post about it, despite it being normal for friends to go places together (X would go places with someone else in the cohort and both would post loads about it). And, often, what they and the other person posted seemed far more cutesy than what I had proposed posting. 

Additionally, I always had to make plans with them at least a week in advance, and there was always the chance they’d cancel at the last minute or stand me up. However anyone else could text them with little more than a ten minute warning and they were down for anything. Often they would decline one of my hangout ideas but then, sometimes the next day, they would go and do that thing with someone else AND post a lot about it. 

I don’t consider myself a possessive person or a jealous person, but eventually this began to hurt. It never bothered me that they had friends who they spent time with, and I never wanted them to treat me better or as more of a priority than their friends, it’s just that I felt like they were treating me like something far less than a friend even as they maintained they wanted to date me. Whenever I tried to express how I felt, they would just brush it off or gaslight me into believing it wasn’t a big deal or that they weren’t really treating me any differently. And I believed them. I believed I was just being too sensitive. 

X would also withhold affection and distribute it when they wanted something from me. Any kind of affection. 

All of them kept happening and eventually got even worse, but I could never tell anyone about it (or felt I could never tell anyone about what I was feeling) because of X’s secret rule, which they didn’t lift until 1 year and 2 months into the relationship, by which time it didn’t even really matter to me because I had suffered so much from what I didn’t realize was abusive behavior. And after we had moved in together. 

At some point I had begun to feel trapped. I didn’t realize this at the time, though. At least not consciously. 

I became incredibly depressed, withdrew even further from everyone, and felt utterly and completely alone. 

To make matters worse, X had actually been communicating with other people about me and our relationship all alone, meaning it wasn’t actually a secret but they had done this to have and maintain control over me. Whenever people in our cohort planned more group outings, they began to only invite me through X. So, rather than texting me or coming up to me, they would go through X to invite me. 

Which is also what they did to inquire after my wellbeing. 

Evidentially they noticed me withdrawing and were concerned. However, rather than ever checking in on me directly, they would always ask X if I was okay. Some of them I shared an office with and saw them 5 days a week. I had conversations with them. Not once did they think to ask me directly if I was okay. I think of things could have gone differently if they had. 

At some point in the 1 year and 7 months that I “dated” X, I had become an alcoholic. Before I was a social drinker. I’d drink at parties or I’d have one beer at a pub when me and friends were hanging out. However X started getting me drunk more often because I guess I’m more fun when I’m drunk. They’d encourage me to drink loads of vodka. I felt bad when I was disappointing X, so I would drink the vodka. It didn’t take me long to long for the euphoria I felt when drunk. It felt like I was finally escaping somehow, so I sought that feeling often. 

However, X would have sex with me when I was totally inebriated. Sometimes it was full sex, other times they would just have me go down on them. In general I’ve always gotten the ick when people have sex with someone who had been drinking, but I definitely believe that if I’d been drinking so much someone wouldn’t let me drive a car (or they wouldn’t get in a car with me) then they shouldn’t be having sex with me. 

It got to the point once when I had to explicitly ask them not to have to have sex with me in any way when I was drunk or even buzzed. I think I said if I had more than 3 shots of anything, or more than 2 glasses of wine/beer, the answer was no. They agreed but, of course, they didn’t stop. 

It kept happening. I think one of the scariest things about all of this is that I’ll never know for certain how many times it happened, not what all happened. I could hazily remember some of it, and hazily register some of it while it was happening (including saying no) but, with time, I find I keep having nightmares where I remember more. Only I don’t want to remember more. 

Eventually I finally told two of the other people in my cohort about what was going on. They were also TAs, which means they were mandatory reporters. But they chose not to report because of their friendship with X. What’s more, they went to X to plan a course of action for me because they were allegedly still concerned for my mental health. 

Even if they didn’t believe me, they were still mandatory reporters who should have reported what I told them and then professionals could have worked it out. And, even if they didn’t do that, it seems so insensitive and absurd to me for them to go to the person who I said SAed me to make a mental health plan for me. I felt so dismissed and discouraged. I felt crazy, like I was just making it up or overreacting. It discouraged me from telling anyone else and so, naturally, things got worse. At some point members of my cohort did report their concerns for my mental health but chose to leave out mention of SA, despite the fact that, looking back on everything now, I was almost a textbook case of the fallout from being SAed. 

Eventually things got so bad, I felt so trapped and so helpless that I attempted suicide. I spent an extended stay in a psychiatric hospital, during which my ex somehow became the victim. When I got out the cohort cluster (about 5 people, plus X, which was the cluster I had believed I was closest with) were mad at me for putting X through the distress of having a suicidal partner. They literally called me selfish. And they were mad at me for not going to them for help, despite the fact that A) they never once inquired about me to me and B) I had sought help from them after over a year of abuse and they dismissed me. 

Looking back on all of this now I can’t believe I allowed any of it to happen. I can’t believe that, even as I knew in my gut I needed to not date X early on, I still allowed myself to get caught up in the web. 

Again, a lot of things didn’t become clear to me until after I moved away from X and the other 5 cohort members. I spent a lot of time thinking I was actually to blame for everything, to the point where I apologized profusely and sincerely to my rapist, as well as to the people who enabled them. 

I even switched fields because I couldn’t even consider a career in what I was in grad school for without being triggered. That’s maybe not as bad as it sounds, because I had been senselessly following a dream I first developed when I was in second grade. I had never stopped to consider if it was what I wanted to do when I got older, I just stayed on the path. I think I actually needed to find a new path anyway, so maybe that’s the one silver lining from all of this. If there is to be one. 

Anyway, next month (February) will mark the two year anniversary of my hospitalization. The last time I saw any of them was in June 2023. And I thought I was doing well. I mean I did find a career path that I enjoy much more than the one I was traveling on, and I’ve learned a lot about myself, my sense of self worth, and things like that, but I thought I had gone through the worst of the trauma. I mean I know healing is not linear, and I knew there would occasionally be bad days, but I think therapy has been causing memories to resurface as pretty debilitating nightmares. They happen almost every night and haunt me through the day if I don’t work hard to distract my brain. I know this is ultimately helping me but, right now, it’s just hard to go through because I thought I’d gotten away, now it just feels like X has trapped me all over again.

I don’t mean to end on a negative note, and I believe the nightmares will go away at some point (or at least not be so prevalent), but I thought maybe sharing my story might help me. I’ve never told it to anyone outside the 5 cohort members and my mental help professionals. Even just typing all of this has lifted a weight off my chest. 

(Thank you so much to anyone who read it. I’m sorry it’s so lengthy. I probably could have condensed it more but I’m prone to rambling.)

Edit: A year after I left the university I reported X and the two mandatory reporters to the Title IX director and campus police. Naturally nothing happened. X was never held accountable. The others continued to coddle them. Some of them are teachers now. I’m not in contact with any of them anymore, and I don’t want to be.

I'm not asking about legally, but from an ethical moral perspective. I had the realization that it could be considered rape earlier this week, but ever since then I have felt so guilty thinking about it using the label of ""rape"" because what if it wasn't actually that, and was just a bad sexual experience?

17031,1i2tza0,post,How Can I Get Justice Against My Assaulter,"I (20F) was taken advantage of by my ex boyfriend (23M) when we were together. Multiple times in our relationship he has pressured me into having sex with him. I always thought it was okay during our relationship because that’s what I was supposed to do. Be the compliant girlfriend and let him have his fun. I always thought as long as he was happy I would be happy. 

One particular time I spent the night at his house. I was asleep and he had work that morning. He had woken me up wanting sex and I did not because I was half asleep. I kept pushing him away and saying no. I was kicking him and the entire time he was laughing (probably thinking it was a game) and pulling my pants and underwear down. This went on for maybe five minutes until I just gave in. I cried and turned my head while it happened and when he finished I just wiped myself off and then curled up into a ball while he went to the bathroom and got ready for work. I fell back asleep and when I woke up I cried again. I drove home crying and took the longest shower afterwards. I felt guilty, I felt used, I was scared. 

I did confront him about it months later when we were arguing and he accused me of lying and trying to put a serious accusation on his name. He claimed I was trying to ruin his life because I was upset. He ignored me for hours while I blew up his phone apologizing and explaining to what had happened. When he replied he said he had no clue about what I was talking about and didn’t remember what happened. He said he was sorry for making me feel that way. I then told him it wasn’t the first time and he’s pressured me into sex before. He said it was a miscommunication and he didn’t know because I wasn’t vocal or loud enough. I felt stupid and I blamed myself. 

I told my friends about it and they felt sorry for me and believed me. I had screenshots of him saying all this but they were on my Samsung. I recently switched to iPhone and now I can’t find the screenshots. 

I’m angry. I’m so angry he’s getting away with it. This happened in 2024. I can’t remember exactly when it happened or the date. I want to file a report but he’s a white male and I’m a black female. If you know how the world works you’d understand why I’m hesitant to go forward. I don’t even have an evidence because I blocked him and deleted our chats on Instagram, Snapchat and when I recovered our messages I couldn’t find anything.

I don’t know what to do. I want him to get consequences. I feel like it’s not fair that I have to live with this rage and sadness while he’s continues life with no repercussions. I got so angry I made an alt account on Instagram and almost sent a message saying how he was a bad person for assaulting a female and how he was even a creep for picking up a 18 year old girl for sex from a high school. I basically laid out his dirty work and I almost sent it but I didn’t. I realized I wouldn’t have accomplished anything, I was just being childish. 

I’m with a new partner (23M) and I’ve told him about this and he’s just as angry as I am. He’s been comforting me when I breakdown about it and keeps me distracted with shows, games and other stuff. I love him so much for that. 

I’m looking for advice on what to do.

I am a survivor of domestic and sexual violence. It happened mostly as a child but it happened for years. The aftermath of everything still affects me till this day. I have PTSD, anxiety and depression. I have panic attacks, flashbacks and nightmares. I am barely eating and sleeping. I rarely leave my house unless I'm going to to campus( I'm a student) or to get grocery shopping.

 I have an irrational fear of any form of physical intimacy with a man and the thought of being physically intimate in any way makes me want to scream, cry and throw up and it gives me panic attacks and it gives me heart palpitations. I also have really bad trust issues and I don't trust anyone to treat me well and I believe everyone around me has bad intentions. 

 I have not told a lot of people what I have been through and I never really got help for it. I have been suffering on my own  for years. I unfortunately do not have a support system (family and friends) so I have been literally going through this all alone for years in my bedroom with no one to talk to. I have nowhere else to turn too and I really really need help. 

I am on the waiting list for EMDR therapy but it'll take a year for me to start seeing someone.","I really really need help and advice please and trigger warning ‼️‼️ This might be a long one so bare with me...

17038,1i2urn4,post,Conflicted Feelings About My Relationship After Past Trauma,"I’m feeling really conflicted about my relationship and could use some advice. I really like this guy I’ve been dating. We’ve been friends for a year and a half, and he confessed his feelings for me a few months ago. He’s kind, caring, gentle—genuinely one of the kindest people I’ve ever met. But sometimes, I feel uncomfortable or even repulsed, and I’m not sure why.

For context, I was assaulted a year ago, and it’s left me feeling uneasy in certain situations. I haven’t been in a relationship since, and this is the first time I’ve tried to open myself up again. Recently, while we were making out, he put his hand up my shirt. I tried to pull away because I needed to leave, but he asked for “just two more minutes.” He wasn’t forceful, and I know he was trying to make me feel good, but it made me feel this weird, passive sensation. I had the thought, “Well, maybe I should just let him,” but it didn’t come from a place of desire—more like obligation.

After I went home, I called him the next morning to talk. I told him I need him to stop immediately when I say no, and he was incredibly apologetic. He said he understands, promised to ask in the future, and even said he’d understand if I didn’t feel safe with him anymore. I believe he genuinely feels bad, and now I feel bad too because we’ve done stuff like this in the past. But sometimes, there’s a moment where my feelings suddenly switch, and I just want him off of me.

I’m realizing that things like this wouldn’t have bothered me in the past, but now they make me feel uneasy—probably because of what I’ve been through. Sometimes I feel close to him and want to be physical, but other times I feel disconnected and unsure. I find myself constantly questioning if I like what’s happening and struggling to stay in the moment. It’s even making me wonder if I have genuine feelings for him, or if what happened to me a year ago has affected me more than I thought.

Has anyone else experienced this? How do you work through these conflicting feelings and figure out what’s okay for you? Any advice on processing this would mean a lot.

","I hate that I started to like it.  Sometimes I wish I was a kid again and my uncle can walk in my room and make me feel like a grown up. 

It’s weird sick too! But I’ve never had sex like the way I did with him.

17058,1i2x50n,post,“I wish I was younger so I could marry you.” ,"Hello. This will be a long story. I feel like my life has paused after an SA incident.

I have been having some trouble recovering from a situation between a close coworker and I. I (23F at the time) had worked part time at a baseball stadium for about 7 years when one season, I lost a bet and had to take a coworker (60M) to dinner. It had always been a light-hearted atmosphere, so I didn’t feel threatened, just a little uncomfortable. It turned out to be fun time though, and we ended up going out on a few more outings where we’d get drunk and watch sports and just chill. New Year’s Day, I was taken advantage of. We went bar hopping - I got blackout drunk, and can only remember him trying to coerce me into the deed. I was completely shocked. Now that I look back on it, I should’ve known it would happen. I tried being lighthearted about the incident at work (because it was such a fun atmosphere, I didn’t want to ruin it for others). It definitely screwed with me though. I still went out with him after the assault happened..I think to prove that he didn’t hurt me. Yeah, ik I was stupid. And he trapped me in his apartment two times again, refusing to give me my car keys, and begging me to sleep with him. I told him plenty of times that I didn’t want to sleep with him.

Eventually, I started lashing out at him at work. We never talked about the incidents, but I could tell I got under his skin. Instead of eating out with him alone, we would invite a good portion of people after work to join. I started bragging about this new crush I had. How this new guy was the “love of my life”. I said it over and over so he would feel shame. All I could think of as I said that was a moment with him (my coworker) - him sitting me down, begging me to let him hug me, and saying “I wish I was younger so I could marry you.” I couldn’t understand what would make a grown man say that. 

I got with my now boyfriend after the season ended. The “love of my life” guy. And I told him everything that happened. About all the mental breakdowns I had, the panic attack, the incidents. He said I should let my boss know, so I recollected everything that happened, wrote it all down, and told her. 

I don’t know what snapped after that but all of a sudden my confidence fell completely. I managed to hold it all throughout the season until I told my boss. I felt so vulnerable and attacked. I was more reactive, more emotional, I didn’t know how to control myself anymore. Anything rational thrown out the window.

I think out of pity, my boss offered me an internship. I was excited about it because I loved where I worked. But it quickly went south after she started micromanaging. We had argument after argument (which would consist of her telling me how terrible of a worker I was). I tried to work the best I could but I was so overcome with grief. About how stupid I was, how unstable I was, I was recked. I had worked there for 7 years and never had an issue with her until this internship. I regretted ever telling her about the incidents with my coworker. I regretted ever trusting her. Ultimately, I just wanted to disappear and die. I ended up quitting after the season.

Lately, my boyfriend has been complaining about my anger. I know I need to work on it but, I’ve never been an angry person before. I’m wondering if it all stems from what happened on new years all those years ago. I’m absolutely gutted to think about how much I’ve failed in this life. I want to be happy again.

17064,1i2y6l9,post,I found out my partner raped someone,"I recently started seeing this guy. He was funny, he was smart (he was famous, also why I’m on a throw away account). He started randomly one day getting really upset at me when I would get upset at him. He wasn’t cheating but he would bring around these friends that liked him all the time and would actively flirt with them infront of me. I would get upset and then he would make me apologize because “he didnt cheat, nothing he did was wrong, it’s his personality, I shouldn’t stop him from having friends and if I had an issue I should have communicated better” etc.

I fell for it a few times and slowly realized this was a manipulation tactic and he had every sign and childhood trauma for NPD. I decided because we were new, I could be his friend, support him, help him. It’s a charity case but it feels good because I’ve been helping his brother too. I want to teach him how to get help (I know I don’t have to do this, but I WANT to. And if it ever becomes too much I’ve told him I will leave)

The issue is, he told me about a false rape allegation a few years that put his career in jeopardy. But it turns out that allegation was more than likely true. As someone who was sexually assaulted myself, I don’t know how to feel. The weirdest part is I don’t even view him differently. He trusts me and I genuinely think I might be the first person in his life that can actually get through to him (his brother said the same) and I know with the way that rape happened it was probably due to his narcissism and him thinking “everyone wants to have sex with me” but it was actually coercion- not to AT ALL minimize the situation. He just has serious problems and for them to not happen again he needs help.

I know you all will say to leave him but I’m in a band with his brother, I do really love him and want to help him, and I feel I can do that without risking my own mental health. But is this morally wrong? I want to teach him to take accountability for that because he is incapable at the moment. I feel like helping him be better could be the best service I can do having experienced rape myself. 

Edit: I had a good friend commit suicide a few years ago and since then I have vowed to help people if I can. So I’m not taking this on because I’m falling for his tricks or a masochist. I just want to make a difference in people’s lives and I have the room in my heart for it. ","I found out my partner raped someone I recently started seeing this guy.

I’m grieving her. I named her. It’s so stupid. I’m actually grieving her. I miss her

And I can’t even explain this pain. Because I didn’t take a test. It was all in my head. I want to scream at him for this pain. But how do I explain it? How do I tell my friends what I’m going through? 

The next day I told my friend I think I miscarried but wasn’t sure. They didn’t know what to say. That’s okay. I know it’s hard. But I was sitting on this bench and they left me. They didn’t even say anything. Just asked why I’d told them and I said because I wanted support and they were silent then left. I’d never felt so alone. We don’t talk anymore. I want to. I reached out. I tried to talk about it. I think they find rape triggering. That’s okay. I don’t know. I want to be friends

17164,1i33tqw,post,How to cope ,"I was recently sexually assaulted by someone last year in September and I’m having a really hard time mentally coping with what happened. It was the first time I was intimate with someone, and I’ve always been very abstinent and told him that I didn’t want to have sex/kiss etc. because I was waiting for the right person. He then kept pressuring me to do sexual favors for him and even though I kept telling him I didn’t want to, he just kept touching me until I gave in and just did what he wanted. Luckily we didn’t have penetrative sex, although he did try to put his penis in me without a condom. He kicked me out afterwards and made me pay for the taxi, and I am feeling so hopeless, used, and absolutely disgusting and dirty. It’s been months and I still cry myself to sleep and feel very unsafe in front of men, and I honestly just don’t know what to do.

17179,1i352r9,post,is it all my fault?,"don’t know what to do with my life anymore, so I’m just writing this down because I feel like I’m losing my mind.
About a month ago, I started seeing someone. We clicked really quickly, and I thought, “Maybe this person is the one,” so I gave it a chance. We spent time together for three days straight, and by the third day, they told me they loved me. That felt weird because we barely knew each other. It seemed like I was being lovebombed they constantly complimented me, but mostly about my body.
I felt things were moving too fast because I need relationships to develop slowly. I told them we should slow down, and they agreed, saying we’d go at my pace. Before we even met, I lied and told them I was asexual because I was scared they might only be interested in me for sex. Later, I admitted I lied because I didn’t want to keep it from them. I explained that I’m saving myself either for marriage or a long-term relationship.
They asked if I wanted to set boundaries, and I said yes, fewer sleepovers (we had already had three) and more time getting to know each other on dates. I made it clear I wasn’t ready for anything more intimate than making out.
A few days later, I hung out with them again at their house with some of their friends. They told their friends they weren’t feeling well so we could be alone, which I understood. We made out, but they started touching me in ways I wasn’t comfortable with. I told them, “Please don’t put your hand there its uncomdy"" and they apologized and moved their hand. But their expression changed they looked salty or annoyed.
When we slept over, they kept touching me in ways I didn’t like, saying sorry each time. Even though I felt uncomfortable, I told them it was fine because I’m a people-pleaser.
Later, I saw a bottle of alcohol and asked to drink. They agreed, even though I told them I have low tolerance and wasn’t experienced with drinking. I had half a glass of 40% vodka, and after that, we started making out again. At some point, I asked them to do the “knee thing” but nothing else. Everything was on top of clothes at this point.
Then they started humping me and touching me down there (over my clothes). I didn’t know what to do, so I let it happen. Suddenly, I realized I was half-naked, and I don’t remember how that happened. There are gaps in my memory, but I remember them touching me under my pants and fingering me. I don’t know if I initiated it or if they did.
They moved on to touching and licking my chest. Then they asked, “Can you come for me?” and I started touching myself because, by that point, my brain wasn’t working properly. They asked, “Should I lick you?” I paused before saying yes. Then they said, “I don’t want to do something you’ll regret tomorrow.” I don’t remember my response, but I closed my eyes, feeling dizzy and drunk, and then they went down on me. I was staring at the ceiling, feeling confused and gross.
I said, “I feel like I smell bad,” hoping they would stop, but they didn’t. But then they started fingering me again and dragged my hand down to their penis.
The next morning, they woke me up by fingering me while I was still half-asleep. It took a while for me to become fully conscious. Later, they apologized, saying, “I’m so sorry we went further than you wanted. I didn’t realize you were that drunk.” But then, five minutes later, they mentioned how drunk I was, saying I almost knocked over their TV when I went to the bathroom. They also said, “You were moaning, you were so hot,” which made me feel disgusting.
I brushed it off and told them it was okay because I didn’t want to lose them.
I told my friend about everything, and she said I was sexually assaulted. I can’t accept that because I feel like it was my fault I said yes, didn’t I? Even though I was halfway passed out, I feel like I let it happen.
At the same time, I feel heartbroken. I miss them so much, even though what happened haunts me. I have nightmares of them touching me. I can’t cope anymore. I told them we needed to end things, saying, “We went too far yesterday; I don’t think we should see each other anymore.” They replied, “I understand, I’m sorry,” and then they blocked me everywhere.
Now I can’t stop thinking about them. Why did they say sorry? Does that mean they know they were in the wrong? What if I hadn’t ended things? Would it have been fine?
But if I was okay with it, why do I feel so disgusted with my body now? What if worse things had happened? I can’t stop grieving the connection we had before that night. If they truly loved me, why did they let me leave so easily? This isnt even all of it bc i still struggle to process it and remember all the details. But please help me.

I'm unsure if this would event count as a sexual assault due to how short it was and it just doesn't seem as serious as it could have been. Was I wrong? Should I have expected this?",0,2.0,2025-01-17 1:43,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1i35bj1/is_it_really_assault/,Neutral

17189,1i363hm,post,bad childhood memories of my mom's late best friend resurfacing ,"
When I was a child (age 6-9), we would go to my mom's late best friend's house. Every weekend from the time i was born until we moved when i was 9-10. 

 in their garage, they had ice popsicles in a deep freeze - those soft plastic packaging ones that you cut and suck out of. I used to grab one, and more often than not, she'd make me sit a cross from her  suck on it; then I'd put my tongue, which had the piece of popsicle, into her mouth, as if we were French kissing. She'd take the piece into her mouth, put her tongue into my mouth, and place the piece back into my mouth. We'd do this back and forth until it was fully melted. Then, I'd take another piece and do it again until the popsicle was finished. I remember hating it, and it would make me incredibly uncomfortable. But it wasn't bad because she told me she just wanted to share my popsicle as she didn't want a whole one all to herself, and sharing was more fun.

 Then I wrote her a letter saying I didn't want to come back anymore, not mentioning why and she cried; I felt bad and hugged her, and then she did it again and again and again until we moved. I remember sometimes sleeping in the same bed as her, but I don't think anything bad happened. She just insisted we spoon whenever we shared a bed. 

 Ever since then, I've had a distaste for ice popsicles, but I couldn't ever remember why. I'm 21 now, and I hadn't thought about it in over 10 years until the other day when it popped into my mind while having a conversation with my girlfriend. It's all I've been thinking about ever since, and I've been having panic attacks constantly. 


 She passed when I was 15-16, but by then, my mom and her weren't in communication, but I still remember crying. My heart was shattered like I lost a family member. I'm questioning whether this constitutes sexual assault, as she never touched me or raped me. I'm struggling to understand my feelings and reactions. Im confused. I loved her and cared for her deeply. I admired and looked up to her so much I have had so much love for her for so long. I loved going to her house; I always had loads of fun and never wanted to leave. She was so cool and great, and her daughters, who were 14-17 at the time, were like big sisters to me, and she was like another mom. I adored her, I loved her more than anything, and losing her was tough. I thought she was the coolest woman and she was so funny. I was always so excited to go to her house. and now everything is confusing and upsetting, but maybe it wasn't sexual assault just a miscommunication. Perhaps I'm being dramatic, and what she was doing, she didn't mean it as sexual assault. I was a child she wouldn't have meant it in a pedophilic way. There's no way she would've. She loved me and cared about me. I was like another daughter to her, and she wouldn't have hurt me not on purpose. 

Did these incidents affect me deeply in my life in ways I didn't even realize? Is this why now I absolutely hate kissing? ","bad childhood memories of my mom's late best friend resurfacing

When I was about 8-9. I mostly slept with my grandparents... when I slept my grandfather often put his hands inside my underwear and shirt, my mother had taught me about SA and bad touches but at the time I never felt uncomfortable. Looking back I realise that maybe that was inappropriate. Last summer I was sleeping(semi-conscious)  my grandfather was rubbing the area underneath my thigh.. I quickly flinched and moved my legs away. I honestly don't know if he had any inappropriate intentions cause most of the time when I accidentally showed cleavage or ran around the house semi-naked(as I toddler/kid) he often told me to cover up..... I know for sure that he loves me and wants the absolute best for me but lately, these thoughts have been circulating in my mind and I so badly want to vent them out. 

Another reason I am probably afraid to go there is cause he has high expectations for me... I've recently changed schools and my percentage has dropped from 95-96% to 87%-88% and have been avoiding talking to him as the main topic of our conversations is usually my academics. 

He is a great man and the crazy thing is that even he has been SAed by his boss(during his 20s) and a librarian(during his teenage years) so the idea of a victim being assaulted sounds crazy to me. I know I should talk about this with my parents but my mom loves him and I don't want to ruin their relationship.

 Moreover, I do love my grandfather and in fact, am ready to forgive him if he had any predatory intentions. I don't know, it just feels weird talking to him now and I suppose I just need support or advice to cope with these weird feelings.","I need to vent out.....

17261,1i3a7g3,post,My me too moment ,"So I have carried this burden for sooo many years, and with my 20 year high school reunion approaching at a HS in WA this year, I just need to vent. 

I don’t even want to go. I dropped out my sophomore year because of what happened, and I just have so much anxiety about being around the people who made me want to end it all at the young age of 15. The reason I’m reliving this is because a handful of my old classmates have been sending me FB invites to the reunion planning group. 

Anyway…this is how it went. 

A close friend of mine asked me if I wanted to go with her to a house party with her. Guy 1’s parents were out of town for the weekend and he wanted to throw a rager. I had never been to a party like that before, but of course after seeing them in the movies and all, I thought it would be so much fun. I mean, they were juniors and seniors, so I felt like it would be a cool way to make friends and get out of my shell. 

My friend and I get to the party, looks pretty typical. People are drinking, hanging out having a good time. I’ve never gotten drunk before, but of course I want to have a beer or two because I don’t want to seem lame. I’m not sure exactly at what point it happened, but not too long after I got there I was completely wasted. I honestly can’t remember if I drank too much or not…I feel like I’ve blocked a lot of memories out and for some reason, I don’t recall. 

I remember asking Guy 1 where the bathroom was because I was feeling sick to my stomach. He said to come with him so he could show me and proceeds to lead me upstairs. I go to the bathroom, I’m wobbling, can barely stand up, and just want to lie down. I come out of the bathroom and he’s still there. He asked me if I wanted to lay down…I thought he was just being nice so I said yes. Next thing I know, he’s pulling my clothes off of me. I was so out of it…I couldn’t even resist it, nor could I comprehend what was actually happening. He had his way with me, got up and got dressed, and went back to join the party. 

Next thing I know, guy number 2 comes in. At this time, I’m laying there stark naked. Guy 2 comes over and just starts having his way with me. I start vomiting all over the floor shortly after, and as I’m projectile vomiting, a junior female walks in on it and looks shocked, and shuts the door and leaves. I’m pretty sure there was another guy in there with guy 2, but I don’t recall who it could have been or if he was planning on being a part of things. 

Guy 1 was the student body president and guy 2 played for the football team. All were very loved and popular, and I was an outsider to them. Even the girl who walked in on it was a popular girl. 

I woke up at that house the next morning, got dressed and started walking home. I was freaking out inside, and so stopped by the clinic and was able to get some plan B. I didn’t say anything about it to my mom, or anyone. 

Monday morning when I walked into school was one of the most awkward and embarrassing moments of my life. All of the people who were at the party were staring at me. It was like a scene from a movie. They hated me, were disgusted by me, and made sure that I knew it. I didn’t know what to do. I wanted to scream. The guys who did it acted like they didn’t even know me. It was the weirdest, most uncomfortable situation I’d ever experienced. I was devastated. I had my virginity stolen from me and I couldn’t even talk to anyone about it. I just wanted to die.  

As the weeks went on, people left me alone. Literally. They acted like I didn’t exist. I was crumbling. After that my life went down a crazy spiral. I couldn’t bear to be at school anymore, so I quit. I got a job at a local restaurant and I worked there and went to night school the rest of the time. 

Flash forward to 2025 and I’m getting these requests to join the HS reunion group. I go to the group and start looking at all of the people putting it together profiles, and one of the girls is married to guy 1! Wtf! I’m definitely not going now, I can’t imagine having to relive that shxt again. 

I guess I just don’t even know. I’ve told a couple of people about it over the years, but nobody that was actually there that night. The trauma caused by that school and the people who participated in it is insane. And then to see my rapist living a happy life with a wife and kids sickens me. 

I just feel like at this point, there is no redemption for me. I wish people knew the real story. I also can’t believe that girl walked in and saw what was happening (me projectile vomiting while guy 2 was still r-png me and she just left. Didn’t try to help or ask if I was okay. Just thinking about it makes me sooo mad. Thanks for making it this far though. I would not wish this on anyone, except maybe guy 1 and guy 2…by a big burly inmate type.

17263,m7l8cvk,comment,,">Rightio. This isn't offensive to the people who are trying to talk about actual SA at all...

>Go google the definition of sexual assault and point out in the story where this friend sexually assaulted you.

Are policing this forum based based on one culture's view of an assault over another? While many cultures seem to think kissing without permission is acceptable, this person has made a reasonable argument that their culture considers kissing more of a sexual nature than others.

In fact, several posts I have seen talk about the violations of kissing. Does someone have a right to go up to a kiss less virgin and just kiss them?

I understand where you don't see this fits the definition of SA by many, but this place is considered a place of support and healing as well as my forum that I more frequent r/rape. Some may argue that my rape (oral rape by coercion) is not as valid as others.

This person has suffered trauma in a way that their culture considers sexual and maybe they might have the right idea on it consider unwanted kissing. As I said, I have been reading a lot of SA and rapes that often start with a violation of a person asking not to be kissed and it pushed on them. I never thought of it myself this way until this OP mentioned it and I am started to see their point of view.

I think with their argument, and backing up with what they said, this forum is apt for them even if most may disagree. We need to stop weighing one person's experience by another.

Now that they explained their reasoning, I am not offended by this post.

I am not saying you did this with malice but I think we need to stop and think a little more before we just push people out if they give a good justification.

This is just my opinion, I am not saying mine is more valid that yours, this is my point of view."," >Rightio. This isn't offensive to the people who are trying to talk about actual SA at all...

In the culture I grew up in, even innocent gestures like putting an arm around someone’s shoulder or hugging are discouraged. Handshakes are considered the most polite and acceptable form of physical contact, while anything more personal depends entirely on the nature of the relationship. That’s why any personal gestures or actions that might cross boundaries require clear mutual understanding to ensure both parties are comfortable.

17272,m7ldhtc,comment,,"Well, kissing inside a relationship in our cultures are not the same as in ways as other aspects, but I do think we need to not just in your culture, consider unwanted kissing when there is no relationship more seriously than we do.  It is a violation of intimacy set aside in your culture for romantic partners.

I have gone through many posts on the rape forums and not thinking back on it, forced kissing before it has been established in a mutual relationship has been the start of a chain of events that have culminated in an assault.

I think you gave a good argument at least from your culture that this is sexual assault and I will label it as such which is why I think it is appropriate here.

Apparently he decided to give me a jab because I didn't say ""sexual assault"" in your case.

So I say it does qualify as a sexual assault."," Well, kissing inside a relationship in our cultures are not the same as in ways as other aspects, but I do think we need to not just in your culture, consider unwanted kissing when there is no relationship more seriously than we do.

17306,1i3c3ji,post,No one believes me,"I was sexually assaulted by a mutual friend 3 times last year. 

This friend was someone I had known for years and trusted with my whole life. 

Each time, I said no, but froze out of shock and fear because I couldn’t believe he was the type of person to do something like this. He kept going, and he’d say “this is just cuddling” and I wouldn’t reply. He made me touch his d1ck, and grabbed me until I bled. 

I took photos as proof. 

I opened up to my friends and showed the photos. Initially, they were supportive. 

After the word got out, the mutual friend told everyone that he thought it was consensual. I blame myself for freezing. I didn’t push him away, I didn’t do enough. This mutual friend is extremely well liked, good reputation and no history of crossing boundaries. Which means my friends came back to me and said they either: don’t believe me, or they don’t know who to believe. 

My partner at the time said it wasn’t all (the mutual friends) fault because I “enabled” it to happen. He made me apologise for not doing enough. Then he broke up with me and considers it cheating. 

I have distanced myself from my friends. I haven’t reached out to my ex. I don’t know who else to reach out to. I blame myself completely.

My partner at the time said it wasn’t all (the mutual friends) fault because I “enabled” it to happen. He made me apologise for not doing enough. Then he broke up with me and considers it cheating. 

I have distanced myself from my friends. I haven’t reached out to my ex. I don’t know who else to reach out to. I blame myself completely.

How do I continue to live my life with the thought that no one believes me, and that I have no one for support?",5,4.0,2025-01-17 8:44,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1i3c3ji/no_one_believes_me/,Neutral

I'm 16, afab but trans. It also might go into more detail than some are comfortable with, please put yourself first, and I hope you have a good day.

I can't sleep due to trauma flooding my head, so I'm seeing if talking about it will help.

When I was 7 I thought I had made a friend, we'd play a little at school, but mainly outside or at his house, one day he told me he wanted to show me something and it ended up being porn, apparently him and his brother found it, he asked me if we could recreate it. I said I didn't want to, but he kept pushing, locking the door to the room we were in and saying please over and over. 

Eventually I said yes, just wanting it to be over, but that was only the beginning. I'd always go back, and he'd always ask me, at first I'd say no, but I learnt that saying no meant nothing, so I'd just agree to get it over with quicker, and it continued like that until I was 10.

It wasn't always at his house either, I remember once when playing in the woods with one of his friends he asked me to go against the tree and to put my arms around him so he could show his friend, his friend didn't even want to watch, so I don't think that was the real reason

It did stop for a bit, but only by his hands. During this time my mum had a miscarriage and I had to move in with my cousin for a few months, about half a year. They were part of the same friend group, and I guess that he showed them all what his brother showed him? As my cousin did the exact same thing. It continued after I left, but it was less frequent, until I was about 8 or 9?

They way they did it made me think I had a choice, and for 5 years I believed I did.

In this friend group 2 more had their way with me, one only had it once, in some dense forest by his house, I can still feel the twigs digging into my back after he told me to lay down. He managed to convince me to use my mouth also. Now I can't handle the texture of raw salmon, I would have been 8-9.

The last was also my ""boyfriend"" or the closest you can get to that so young. He would beg to touch me and grope me in school, sometimes even on the playground when all I wanted to do was play. He'd also make me touch him. I still feel disgusted remembering him say stuff like ""do you like it?"" It stopped for a couple years, but he asked for the final time in year 6 after his ex gf left the school, making me wonder if he did it to her too.
All 4 of them would tell me not to tell anyone, they knew it was wrong. 

That was all the physical stuff.

At 12 I dated a 17-19 year old, I didn't know her age, I for whatever reason assumed she was 13-14 at most, as most of her friends were, but she knew mine, It was in my bio and I told her, she also faked her cancer and cheated on me with a 13-14 year old

12-14 I was groomed by at least 4 older men during hypersexual episodes, they would convince me it was normal, that it was okay, and that I wanted to do what they were telling me. Honestly I was so detached at this point I don't really remember more than that

And lastly at 15 I was loveboomed and manipulated by a girl after I denied sending nudes, and once I finally did, she stopped replying

We’d kiss on occasion at a party but it was nothing serious and never went farther than that as I’m waiting till marriage and don’t like doing sexual things. However my gf and two guy friends left, and it was just me and the guy I had a talking stage with left. I’ll call him Jack, so I was trying to calm myself down because I was really messed up and Jack wanted to get into my hot tub, (at the time he was talking to this girl and they were close to dating, and me and him are friends so I thought nothing of this) so I joined him in the hot tub because I was greening out and seeing patterns and just God knows what. I trusted Jack to not try anything on me because we both mutually agreed that whatever we had in summer ended and that didn’t need to start back up again. So I got in the hot tub, sat on the OPPOSITE side of him and then that’s when I see him eyeing me up and down and I just start thinking to myself “shit”. I was not in my right state of mind, and my body was slowly starting to react less and less to what my mind was thinking. Jack KNEW this, (he was drunk but he knew how messed up I was) , he comes over and looks at me and says “you know you’re in a bikini so I’ve got to try something” my mind is screaming no, but like I said I was practically a vegetable and genuinely could barely talk. He makes his way over to me and starts feeling my up, and I’m just sitting there praying he’d leave. In my head I was screaming “NO NO NO THIS ISNT WHAT I WANT.” But my body just wasn’t reacting to anything like I wanted it too, I couldn’t push him off of me. Eventually, I manage to finally say “Jack I’m not making out with you.” And he looks at me and says “No you have to, just enjoy it.” And starts feeling up on me more and touching places I definitely didn’t want. This moment was terrifying for me and I feel so violated because of it. Jack then started to try and readjust me so he could pin me down, and I manage to say “No no no no please stop please no” or something like that and he stops (thank God ) but looks at me and says “Cmon *my name* you’re really saying no? Really? I want to, let me.” I start tearing up and tried to get up to get out of the hot tub, my girlfriend was still gone (they went to go get food) and it was just us two and I was just trying to keep it together long enough for her to get home. This spot is a little splotchy in my memory but somehow I made it back inside my basement, (where we were, my hotub js directly outside of it) and then my girl friend made it home, I somehow made it to my bed; changed and was out for 36 hours. That entire time I was asleep I had nightmares about what Jack did to me, and during that time I was asleep I’d get woken up by my parents and my vision was hazy and blurry, anytime I’d try to stand I’d fall to the floor and get extremely nauseous and my muscles ached and overall this feeling was just God awful. As a future college athlete I felt like a bum for this, and obviously that’s not the life I want to live so I’ve learned my limit. But when I finally woke up, my parents planned a trip to the mountains for thanksgiving day and when I say this day was horrible I mean it. Jacks actions kept replaying in my head and I spent thanksgiving day sobbing; feeling violated , disgusted with myself and depressed because Jack was someone I could trust to be around in that state and I feel like I he took advantage of me. I haven’t gotten over this and I can’t speak out to anyone about it because no one would believe me, and in the friend group I’m in he’s a big part in it, everyone likes him and his house is a big hangout spot. He’s been super nice to me recently and it’s hard to believe all of that even happened but then I get flashbacks to that night and it hits me all over again. But am I overreacting I don’t know this is all so hard for me to process even if it was two months ago I’m still really hurt. ","Is this even sa?  I’m 16f, and an athlete that’s gonna play in college. But naturally, I drink and party and do edibles on occasion with my friends. However, one night things when too far over thanksgiving break (November). I had some of my guy friends over and a girl friend of mine; and I took edibles and drank too much alcohol and started to green out and got heavily intoxicated (so I was crossed BAD.) one of the guys I had over, we had a little talking state at the end of summer going into September. We’d kiss on occasion at a party but it was nothing serious and never went farther than that as I’m waiting till marriage and don’t like doing sexual things. However my gf and two guy friends left, and it was just me and the guy I had a talking stage with left. I’ll call him Jack, so I was trying to calm myself down because I was really messed up and Jack wanted to get into my hot tub, (at the time he was talking to this girl and they were close to dating, and me and him are friends so I thought nothing of this) so I joined him in the hot tub because I was greening out and seeing patterns and just God knows what. I trusted Jack to not try anything on me because we both mutually agreed that whatever we had in summer ended and that didn’t need to start back up again.

17341,1i3hc22,post,Forgiveness?,"I’m 17 years old and have been sa’d online by two different women and my father was sexually suggestive to me as a child.

Now, my father, I cannot forgive because he hurt and caused pain to others. I can forgive someone hurting me I suppose, but not others, and my last words to him were ones of pure disgust and disdain.

When I was freshly 14, I knew 2 different girls and my sexuality was undecided at the time.
One was 22, the other was 23.
The 22 year old pressured me a little bit and groomed me into a slightly sexual relationship in nature
Now I don’t really know I feel about her, at first I was shocked and couldn’t sleep, now I’m indifferent, I don’t really know anymore, I couldn’t care less if she dies or if she gets away with it. I’m just tired.

The other woman was 20 after her, and I was freshly 15 now, and she had known me a year before.
I really looked up to her and I confused it for romantic love (kind of).
She was worked with autistic kids mentally ill children aged 3-16.
I am a mentally ill, autistic child, or was. I’m going to be 18 this year so I’ll be legal (unfortunately).
She left me after 9 months and I was traumatised so bad I stopped eating properly which put me in the hospital.

So the 20 year old I have mixed feeling about.
I want to move on and just forgive her for myself, because I missed who I was before it happened.
I was always told I was warm, caring and ambitious.
And my friends and my mother just watched the life draining from my eyes, without an idea why.

I want to start to forgive to free myself of the bitterness that consumed me after the experience.
But at the same time, I would only forgive her for hurting me. What if she does the same to a child where she works, she lives countries away from me.
Do I forgive her for myself?

17343,1i3hgvi,post,How do I move forward without fear and disgust? SA'D by close friend who then claimed I am responsible to unknown number of people.,"Thank you to anyone who takes the time to read this.

About two years ago I was going through basically the worst set of circumstances possible and had everything fall apart catastrophically including a breakup, I moved back to my hometown and invited two (at the time) close friends to come visit to cheer me up. We are all male and in our early to mid 20's.

I struggled with alcohol and substance use (now sober), and over the course of the night myself and one of these friends got far too messed up, got back to bed and passed out. One friend (I will refer to this person as X) remained sober throughout the night and mainly just tailed us wherever we went. When I was blacked out X person managed to get me up and into a seperate room with him (I have an extremely hazy memory of being kissed while not fully aware of where I was and staggering up) where he sexually assaulted me as I was in and out of consciousness. He then left the room and slept on the couch.

The day after this happened he tried to talk to me multiple times claiming I was into it and he repeatedly pushed the idea of us having a relationship together and continually suggested that we should ""try it"" to see what happens between us. I felt sick and was dissociated the entire day and reaffirmed that I was not interested, their insistance and gaslighting continued for hours. Throughout this day they also claimed another mutual friend had inappropriately touched them when they didn't want it, that someone else we know tried to force them into oral sex, and a multitude of other farcical stories about abusive random people and exes. I cancelled all plans we had made and let them stay in my house until they were due to leave the morning after. While sleeping that night X person came into my room and got into my bed again without my consent and tried to cuddle and kiss my neck as I requested multiple times that they leave, they reluctantly left as I began to insist they get out after asking 5-6 times. I didn't take the correct actions and allowed things to go on and gave them the benefit of the doubt as I felt at the time that I may have genuinely instigated and been responsible for everything that happened (struggled with low self esteem and quite a lot of abuse growing up which I suppose informed my guilt).

After leaving my house they sent me many text messages complaining that they felt I ""slept"" with them because they were easy and available, that it was wrong for me to do anything with them if I wasn't interested in a relationship, that an unwritten rule of sleeping in a bed together (I would not have chosen to) was that nothing happens between friends, that they saw me as a ""big brother"" so it hurts them that we ""were intimate"", and more of the same and endless blame games pushing the responsibility for what happened while I was not fully conscious or consenting and they were sober on me. A couple of months later a mutual friend told me they had hooked up with X person and they had been recieving weird and manipulative messages about it ever since, and they had caught him snooping through their draws and belongings in the middle of the night.

When I messaged X person asking what was going on with this mutual friend they immediately shut down, sent me a message claiming that I had raped them and said the fact I was drunk and don't remember it doesn't matter. They then blocked me and told multiple people (I'm still unsure how many) that I am a rapist and had assaulted them.  
The other friend who was there was blacked out through all of this and knew something was wrong the day after but figured it was hangover related and didn't push the topic, he's expressed his guilt at not doing something at the time and has done his best to be supportive but of course it's not his fault.

I lived with guilt about this for a long time as I didn't know how to deal with what had happened at all and it completely spun my head. I now realise it was not my fault but I feel so disgusted and angry with their behavior, the fact I ever believed their elaborate stories of evil people in their life and abusive exes and the fact I treated them with so much patience and forgiveness through my own guilt, and I'm scared they raise their head again to spread this bullshit (I have an increasingly public career where something like this would be legitimately devastating). I don't know what to do to get rid of the anxiety that follows me around nor the feeling of being trampled over and never getting to explain what really happened, and I know people out there think I'm an abuser because of it. I'm concerned I may have PTSD as I get continual intrusive thoughts and fear over it. It feels like so much of my time and peace has been stolen.

Where do I start when it comes to getting better, and how do I get rid of intrusive thoughts/flashbacks?  
Admittedly I still feel pangs of guilt or like in a roundabout way it's my fault or I caused it to happen through my actions.","How do I move forward without fear and disgust?

She blatantly said “ I found them kissing twice” I noticed my 9 year old sister was avoiding my 12 year old cousin but I just assumed they were bothering her as always. I’m not sure how to bring it up and how to tell them it’s not okay… I also need to tell my mom to talk to her sister (my aunt) about this but I just know she already knows. Her kids are odd and their sons have showed interest to me and my cousins even though we’re first cousins. I’ve been through the same situation with a girl as a kid and to be honest I still don’t know how to feel. 
My worry is they went further and I don’t want my 6 year old sister to feel disgusted or think I’m shaming her.

17353,1i3iice,post,My girlfriend was sexually abused as a child by her close relative. Her family is aware and never took time to address this traumatic experience and my girlfriend still has to interact with the culprit that has been protected for over a decade. ,"My girlfriend still interacts with her rapist and her parents house him.

Most barriers in our relationship stem from trust and this sexual trauma and abuse that was never addressed and it’s like I’m left to work through this while my girlfriend continues to perform and not address her parents, her relative. I’m even more annoyed because she’s at home visiting and her parents are oddly obsessed with her not dating me and have never asked how their daughter is feeling coping with abuse from a relative that was 20 years older than her at the time of her abuse. She was only a little girl not even 10 yet. It pisses me off so bad. The relative has never apologized or given her space to understand why there were no consequences and she still has to be around  him with her parents… to me these people are not accountable and it’s not fair to her. 

This family dynamic is projected into our relationship as she shuts down often and pushes me away when I just want to support her and protect her. I hate that her own family does realize this. I hate that she has to perform for rape apologist that are her parents. I hate that she has to be around her rapist during family celebrations. This is all so odd to me.

17359,1i3kfny,post,Does this even count or is it in my head,"this is very long so I am grateful to anyone who reads this and has something to say



A few months ago on a student party I met this guy and we got along and spoke outside the bar. He was very forward with me and was touching me a lot which I was okay with but got a little annoyed of. I had drank but definitely wasn't drunk and I was lowkey enjoying him and the attention and making out with him. We were both students and realized that we not only went to the same uni but also lived in the same accomodation. Me, him and 2 of my friends decided to go back to our building together and I when we were there he somehow convinced me to come to his apartment and chill with him as my roommate was in my room already. 

Before going, I knew my boundaries and I was an inexperienced virgin and knew that it was not a line I wanted to cross. When we got to his apartment his entire flat was in but since it was 4am they were all sleeping and so we hung out in the living room. All the lights were off and we were making out. I offered to give him head and it was okay but he wasnt even close to coming we both realized that this was not working and he asked to have sex. I said no that I was a virgin and that I just didnt want to do it but he was not taking no for an answer and was kind of begging me. After refusing several times, we spoke and I told him about how I don't want to lose my virginity to a stranger and that I would like something serious to happen if this were to happen and he said yes. Finally, frustrated I said yes and that was my first time. 

During it, I kind of dissociated and was stressed out that his flatmates would walk out into the living room and I also pretended to finish so that he would get the hint and stop but he didnt. After a while he finally fiinished and went to the bathroom. I can't lie, during sex he was very respectful and made me feel comfortable and afterwards I immediately got dressed back and cleaned myself and was going to leave his apartment when he said he wanted to talk to me. I was sitting on the floor outside his bathroom and I think for the first time that night we spoke about something real and it wasn't just him trying to tease me while I was talking about something that was important to me. 

The next morning when I woke up I got a follow back from him but no dm. I waited for him for a few days and nothing. Finally the next week I sent him a message to meet and he replied saying that we could chill for a bit after dinner at his apartment. When I went there his entire flat was in the living room just chilling and I was so embarrassed because I felt like they knew but I stayed strong and he could sense that I was not comfortable so we went on a walk. I realized that we didn't really have much in common and also that he lied about everything, especially about wanting something long term. He literally just used me for sex. I felt horrible and so not in control. After that I kind of got obsessed with him because I wanted him to want me so that I could reject him or at least do something on my terms but he did not care. I was in such denial about what happened that night and felt so bad about it like it was regretful but I was just more sad that this thing happened to me not on my terms with someone who cared about me. I felt objectified. I would always bump into him and he would talk to me as if nothing happened and my friends were in some of the same classes as him so they knew him but didnt know the situation so we would always have to interact with him and i just felt like utter shit whenever I saw him. 

The entire semester I just tried to heal. I thought I could forget about him by finding another guy but anytime I would find a guy to talk to or go out on dates with I would get so much anxiety surrounding it and just not a healtyhy attitude towards intimacy because of this (i realized this now after doing some reflection but at the time I just thought there was something wrong with me) 

After a few months, I started feeling much better and I became friends with this girl who was an exchange student. We were talking about the night outs and parties and she mentioned this guy. She talked about her experience with him and apparently on the same night out, before meeting me, he met her. He tried to get her to sleep with him as well and she rejected him. He did all the same exact moves on her and when she rejected him he said that it was fine because he was going to have sex tonight no matter what because he has so much testosterone and needs to get it out. and right after that, he met me. 

After hearing this, I felt even worse about the whole situation and I simply do not know how to deal with this. I told my best friend who does not go to my uni and know him and she didn't really have much to say except comfort me (which was nice) but I just want everything to go back to normal. I just want to have normal attitudes towards relationships and sex and I just want to not be afraid of men wanting to use me (I had never dated before because all the men I wanted to be in a relationship with always wanted to use me for sex)  To be honest, I don't even know if this is SA because I did say yes but that was after saying no so many times. I just don't feel like everything that happened that night was my decision. Has anyone gone through something similar or have any advice for me? I do not want to go to therapy because the affordable uni counselling is very traditional as I am from a conservative place. I just want my last semester at uni to go nicely and not really have any big drama. I definitely do not want to confront him or even speak to him. I have already limited my chances of interacting with him by moving accomodation.

17406,1i3qq1t,post,My Therapist Urged Me to Report and Now I Might Be Pressing Charges and I Have Questions Before I Do,"Hi, I’m new here and what happened to me happened over a decade ago. The man who assaulted me didn’t listen when I repeated the word no several times it didn’t work until I let it happen and then “pretended.” It wasn’t violent and I was being emotionally manipulated during the relationship and of course it ended. About 4 years after I realized what happened was rape and 2 years ago I got into therapy and worked through it after a lot of suicidal ideation and depression. I’m in an awesome place. 

However, I’ve never told anyone but a few very close friends what happened and no one from my family. The man in question is from a somewhat prominent family in the area, his parents own/manage a restaurant with a dedicated customer base and this town isn’t small but it’s not large enough. I run a small art business that recently kicked off and I’m finally a bit more financially stable after losing almost everything due to COVID job loss. All my art clients are outside my state, so I don’t think he or his family can hurt my business in retribution. Additionally, I’ve always said I want to rapists behind bars or dead and it’s time to put my own rapist away and stop looking over my shoulder.

This man also has more financial resources than I’ve ever had so I’m making the assumption that his mother will continue to treat him like the golden child (they’re very traditional Mandarin and believe strongly in the innate heroism of children born in the year of the dragon) and he will be able to afford a good criminal attorney and since I worked in corporate legal, I know the discovery phase can be incredibly invasive. I’m just assuming that a criminal defense attorney worth any money will basically rip into my life and enter it all into public record. 

I’m in Utah, USA. 

Here’s what I need to know before I press charges: 

* is there any privacy for victims during proceedings? 
* how invasive do investigations get? As far as I’m concerned it should be the moment, that two hours, that’s on trial and nothing else. 
* I’m going to tell my family, I’ve already told my friends, and I have appointments scheduled with my therapist, but what else can I do to help protect myself, my assets.
* what can he do to damage my life further?
*do I need an attorney? 


I went into this thinking I’ll file a report to establish a pattern of behavior so someone else can get justice, but now I’m a little shocked that I might get justice.

* I’m going to tell my family, I’ve already told my friends, and I have appointments scheduled with my therapist, but what else can I do to help protect myself, my assets.
* what can he do to damage my life further?
*do I need an attorney? 


I went into this thinking I’ll file a report to establish a pattern of behavior so someone else can get justice, but now I’m a little shocked that I might get justice.

17447,1i3vpj7,post,Coming to terms has been difficult,"TW: SA involving a minor

Background:
I was 16F and the first time it happened the guy was 27M. I considered him a close friend but one time he got me drunk and, while I did say I do not want to do anything like that earlier that day, he still did. I resisted and fought back for a while, although I never truly said ""No"" or ""Stop"". It had been so difficult for me to realise it was not my fault, specifically because in the act I never actually said anything, and because I did not fight back more.

I did try to get therapy a few years back. When I felt comfortable enough to tell my therapist the beginning of the story (I did not get to tell her the entirety of it), she just said ""Did you do this because you wanted to feel like a woman? You were 16, not 12, it's not like you didn't know"" thing which set me back to spiraling and blaming myself again.

It took a lot for me to come to terms with the fact that I did not do anything and it was, in fact, not my fault.

That was the last time I saw that therapist (and any therapist tbf)

During this time, I had a weird relationship with sex, being unable to truly enjoy it but never really knowing why.

Now, 7 years after that guy did what he did, I can confidently say I am comfortable enough that I can talk about what happened (to close friends) and I can finally enjoy being intimate again. It took a lot and I was extremely lucky to have an amazing support system made up of my loving boyfriend who was with me when I was going through the realisation process and is still here for me, and my best friend who was also there every step of the way.

To anyone reading this and going through whatever it is you are going through, let me tell you this: it DOES get better. And when it does, you're going to feel amazing, strong, happy. 

Hang in there. 🫶🏻","Coming to terms has been difficult TW: SA involving a minor

Background:
I was 16F and the first time it happened the guy was 27M. I considered him a close friend but one time he got me drunk and, while I did say I do not want to do anything like that earlier that day, he still did. I resisted and fought back for a while, although I never truly said ""No"" or ""Stop"". It had been so difficult for me to realise it was not my fault, specifically because in the act I never actually said anything, and because I did not fight back more.

I did try to get therapy a few years back. When I felt comfortable enough to tell my therapist the beginning of the story (I did not get to tell her the entirety of it), she just said ""Did you do this because you wanted to feel like a woman? You were 16, not 12, it's not like you didn't know"" thing which set me back to spiraling and blaming myself again.

He told me I shouldn’t have gone on vacation with my now ex if it was such a big deal. I feel so drained. I don’t have any friends to talk to either. I feel so alone and hopeless.

17458,1i3x9w1,post,Starting Over At 27.,"Hi, everyone. 

This is my story and where I am now. 

Long story short, this is the turning point in my life. 

I dropped out of engineering a few years ago because of something I never thought would happen. One of my teachers (this guy is happy in life. I checked.) abused me for two years, straight. It started with him giving me good marks for shitty assignments. When I missed a few classes, he told me to come to his place where he would take extra classes. Then he did the unthinkable. , I felt completely powerless. I couldn’t do anything. 

I spent the next three years in a spiral of depression, PTSD, and therapy. I even tried to kill myself few times. It took everything I had just to heal and find some sense of normalcy again when I knew there's nothing left. During that time, my friends moved ahead in life. They graduated, started jobs, and some even got married(I don't think I want that with my past).  Meanwhile, I was stuck, barely holding on.

But eventually, I found the strength to continue my education. I finished my degree through online learning. I got the piece of paper,  but I only got 55% marks. I had been a bright student all my life, but now just lost and below average. Now this - - maybe because of the meds. I remember I used to be an extrovert and even had a relationship. Even I developed stammering. Since last year i put efforts to reduce it. Now it's much better. 

I know where I want to see myself in the next 1 year but I don't know how. 

My goal for 2025 is to rebuild my life. I want to make good money. Since young I wanted the high life, but that incident just changed the course. I want to have experiences. I want to make up for the memories I didn't make. I want to feel alive again. 

I’m taking control.

I'm done feeling stuck. I'm done being depressed. I'm done being miserable.  

I’ve healed enough to realize I want more for myself. Fast. I will climb the Social Ladder this year to the top. 

I need a plan and some guidance. If there's anyone out there who's been through something similar, or who has climbed the ladder from scratch. I would love to hear from you. I need a mentor who can point me in a direction. I'm a fast learner and now I have the hunger. I'll make it.

17462,1i3xfzv,post,Navigating multiple sexual assaults over a long period of time ,"Hi guys. About 6 months ago I started seeing a therapist to work through a recent assault/rape. Throughout our conversations and my independent processing, I realized that I’d been sexually assaulted multiple times throughout my life. I'm a dissassociator to the core, so I never took the time to think about how these assaults affected me. I thought it was easier and less painful to just pretend it didn't affect me. I now know this isn't true and I was damaging myself further by pushing this down.

A few weeks ago, I wrote down how many times and specific circumstances of the assaults, and the amount of times was really distressing to me. At first I felt so much shame. I asked myself, “what’s wrong with me or what did I do to make this happen so much.” My parents physically and emotionally neglected me as a child which I know plays a role in the type of love and attention I seek. Even though I feel shame and I want to blame myself, I know that’s just a gut reaction to my trauma.

I’m older now and have been married for almost a decade. My husband is such a wonderful partner has helped me understand what healthy love is. I’m continuing to attend therapy and work through all areas of my past and present self, but this layer of shame, guilt, and overwhelming isolation remain like a grimy layer on my guts and my heart and my thoughts.

What has helped you with the after-effects of sexual assault and the dark mark that lingers in the background of life? Thank you!

16122,1hznln2,post,Is this still sa ?,"In September I went on holiday to tunisia and when we got there I was given a adult wrist band by the hotel (I'm 14 now but at the time i was 13 but a little taller for my age and I've got more in the chest department ifkwim) but me and my family laughed it off and got on with it. But on the third day a man I can't remember his name anymore waved at me and was looking me up and down I smiled at him but he kept waving and going ""hey"" until I waved back I brushed it off thinking he was just playing with me and I went to get lunch , after I finished lunch he did it again and again again after everytime I I walked past his little chair by the pool (this  man is a life gaurd btw) and eventually I wanted to go on the slides and he was there and everytime I went up to the slides he had this sick smile on his face and he grabbed my waist ,my arms ,my hand and  shoulders he grabbed me everywhere ( he didn't touch any more private parts ) and he tried to kiss me one time but I pushed him away before all this started he said something in another language to the other life gaurd at the top and 5he other life gaurd literallynever talked or looked at me after he said whatever he said . I only managed to get away from him was when I pretended my dad was calling me , I literally RAN to find my dad and I told him he went storming over to him cause at this point I was crying I just wanted it to stop. He found the man who was with another man and my dad confronted him and he pretended not to speak English even tho I knew he could. After it all calmed down it was heavily implied that he had done this before beacuse the other man speaking on behalf of him was begging not to tell the hotel manager or anything otherwise he would get fired. And the cherry to top it all off is that my mum told me that ""this happens to gurls in life I just have to get used to it"" is this realky what I have to go through my entire life?

Anyways this all happened at tui blue manar , hammamet,tunisia.

Am I over reacting cause i can't stop thinking about his hands and his dirty smile.

16133,1hzq6xb,post,am i a victim of SA?,"(to specify, i am young. we were both young, but she had alot of experience with sex) I just wanted to post here because ever since it happened iv been unsure if i should call it SA or if thats overreacting or idk.  but basically, recently i dated a girl (im also female \[nonbinary\]) and we broke up after like a week. i had had a crush on her for a bit beforehand, and when we had a sleepover i made moves (nothing sexual, just holding hands) and eventually she dared me to kiss her, and after a bit i did.

a little later i think, we started making out, and i didnt feel too uncomfortable until she started touching me. i had always questioned if i was asexual but i was unsure so i didnt tell her to stop. i dont want to get too into detail because again it was very recent, but at most she fingerfvcked me, basically.

i wasnt into it all at lol. it hurt like hell, and whenever she kissed my neck id stare at the wall, and i would've zoned out if i wasnt faking being into it. idk why i didnt push her away, she's really weak and cant fight, but thats not important anymore ig.

afterwards we went to sleep, and i just stared at the wall and replayed what happened over and over again. i felt gross, and still do feel gross. the next morning it hurt to go to the bathroom and i wanted to yell at her so bad or do something but iendufhfje i didnt :/

ever since then, iv noticed iv sexualised myself more often since then, and at the same time been more averse to sex since then. whenever i see sex or even kissing on TV i freeze up and sometimes get flashbacks. once i saw a character that reminded me of her and i wanted to break the screen and throw something at them so bad. i watched a phych2go video earlier about SA and thats what convinced me to make this post. im sure i got traumatised by the event, no doubt, and im definitely asexual now.

sorry if my spelling or storytelling is bed, this is the only time iv told anyone about this, and it couldn't of happened any later than 2 weeks ago (my sense of time is really bad so it was probably more recent than that.) so its still fresh and i dont like thinking about it.

so, can anyone tell me if they think this might be SA? i kinda consented and even played along, knowing full well what was happening, and she even said to tell her if it hut and she'd stop, but i never did. i dont want to think im a victim of something im not, or to claim her as an abuser when i might've consented.

edits: i forgot to add. the next sleepover we had, she kept trying to touch me again, and i told her no and she got annoyed with me and didnt listen to me until i borderline yelled at her.","am i a victim of SA?

16137,1hzr8qs,post,"Was it SA, or does this just happen with random hookups?","So I'm 21FtM, fully passing in public, top surgery a year ago, no bottom surgery. I'm fully comfortable with myself in public and in bed, and since July, I've been hooking up with a lot of guys on Grindr -- some very good, some just average, whatever. I know that not every sexual experience is going to be perfect, since we're strangers -- almost every time, I meet with someone in public first and talk for a bit before going to sleep with them.

In the past, there's one person in particular that I knew from talking to him that I wasn't attracted to him at all; I still chose to go back to his place, and while the sex was happening, I just closed my eyes and really wanted it to be over. I didn't say no, I didn't make any obvious resistance, I just knew in my head in that moment that I didn't want it to be happening. That's one thing, I thought about it for a while after, but I at least had a conversation with him, and he was normal-ish.

Something similar happened last night, but I've been thinking about it nonstop since it happened, so I just wanted to see what other people thought. For context, I was studying abroad in Europe in the fall semester, and now I'm vacationing in a major city and staying in a hotel by myself. I've never had this sort of freedom or opportunity, and I feel very privileged being here (and getting high in my own time; weed is legal here). Anyway, so I thought I would host, since I've never done that before, so I found a guy on Grindr who looked halfway okay, and I was messaging him. I knew already from the texts that he was kind of pushy, just very insistent about the whole thing, but I thought okay whatever, it'll be okay. So eventually he gets here, and from the minute he walked in to the minute he walked out was 12 minutes. Like I said before, I like to talk a bit before sex (even though I wouldn't say no to sex anyway based on the conversation), but as soon as he came in, he immediately started undressing me and himself and kissing me (which was kind of gross). His face was similar enough to the pictures, but his body wasn't all that attractive to me -- which I probably would have found out if we had talked a bit longer online beforehand.

So we immediately go into having sex, and I'm super dry down there, and in my head I know it's wrong, but I don't say anything. He tried to do some weird position that I've only seen in porn, I wasn't really sure what he wanted me to do, but whatever. At some point, he's behind me, and he asks to film. I say no, maybe he didn't hear me, his English isn't that good (I'm in a German-speaking city), and he takes a video anyway. After he left, I had him send me the video. It doesn't have my face or anything, and no one would know it's me, but I still find the video very embarrassing and demeaning, and I'm not sure how to feel about it.

Anyway, he finishes pretty quickly (which I'm grateful for), and leaves immediately after that. I think maybe there were 20 words exchanged the whole time. I never said no, but he was pretty aggressive (just like how he was in his texts), and it wasn't very comfortable for me. I'm just not sure how I should feel about this. I know it's my fault, that I should have said no. I don't usually feel self-conscious, but now I do about being in that specific position again because of the video.","Was it SA, or does this just happen with random hookups?

16158,1hzsr2g,post,I don’t know if it’s that bad really ,"i (25f) moved to a new country in september. Mid september i met this guy (22m) through a mutual friend and he was very friendly and i wanted friends since i had none so i humoured him and texted him back whenever he texted me, but it was all strictly platonic. in october there was this event that his friends were holding that he told me about and i wanted to go so we went. at the event he suddenly got very touchy and close without even asking me, he would put his arm around me and grab my waist or hug me, and he’s never done any of that before. I was visibly uncomfortable and tried doing my own thing away from him but he would always follow me around. i later found out that all his friends were under the impression that we were dating. 

after the event he was really drunk but still insisted on walking me home, i told him i want to take a taxi but he refused and just insisted. so he walked me home and when we got to my building he hugged me, and wouldn’t let go for ten whole minutes. in the street. he hugged me and moaned and kissed my neck. then told me to give him a house tour and don’t ask me why i agreed i have no fucking clue, yes i’m stupid sometimes. I made him only stay in the kitchen, and told him we can’t go inside. he listened. 

then in the kitchen he started hugging me again and kissing my cheek and forehead. i learned that in a fight or flight situation, i freeze. 

he then kept saying how he wants to cuddle but i didn’t entertain that thought, i told him no. so then he sat on the floor and told me to get into his lap, facing him, with my legs around him, even though i tried to sit facing away from him he made me sit to face him. i was honestly scared and nervous, he’s bigger than me. he hugged sitting down like that and moaned a bit more. 

i got up after like a minute and asked him to leave. he asked for another hug then a kiss, and i said no. he said “next time” and i said no next time because your too young. then he hesitantly left. 

this is my fault, and it’s not as bad as it could’ve been. but why do i keep feeling disgusting and icky and nasty whenever i remember the incident or even see him or hear his voice. i just get this really uncomfortable feeling like i want to crawl out of my skin, but nothing really happened. also he’s way younger so it just feels so pathetic ","I don’t know if it’s that bad really  i (25f) moved to a new country in september.

as such I keep returning to an event that happened honestly nearly a decade ago. I was friendly with a guy for a few years. he was part of a wider friendship group and we would hang out with others never just the two of us. one night a group of us had gone out and I ended up getting absolutely smashed- I'm talking so drunk parts of the night is just a blur. somehow the group disbanded and I had left my phone and wallet with a friend who accidentally took them home so I ended up in a taxi going home with the male friend figuring id have to sleep on his couch until morning and I could organise myself . this is where the alcohol blurs some stuff  but I don't remember feeling overly alarmed at having to spend the night there. I vaguely remember struggling to walk up his drive I was so drunk. The next thing I know I wake up in his bed with him having sex with me. It took me a second to realise what was going on and once I did I pushed him off and literally ran out the door. I don't believe I said stop. Just got him off me and ran. We had never had anything other than a completely plutonic relationship- in fact he was seeing another person at the time. Later the next day the girl he was seeing actually messaged me quite nastily saying I better get checked as he had Chlamydia and calling me a bunch of names for sleeping with him. I did indeed get checked and turns out she was right. He'd given me Chlamydia. I'd had an IUD put in 3mths prior and had the standard STI panel done then and was negative and hadn't slept with anyone else so it was definitely him. It was horrifying. I felt so violated and disgusting but at the same time so ashamed because I felt like my being so drunk allowed this to happen. I've had so many doubts over the years as to whether he even did anything wrong or it was all me. I mean he even TOLD the girl he was seeing we slept together? And for a few months afterwards I'd see him at events with the same friendship group and he'd act like nothing had happened so I almost felt like nothing had? If it was actually wrong then why would he tell the girl? Why act like nothing's happened? But at the same time - I was clearly unconscious when he was having sex with me. I've recently discovered I'm pregnant and I'm realizing so much of my current anxiety is around a feeling of not being in control of my body anymore with all the changes pregnancy is bringing- and I keep circling back to that night. I'm not sure what the point of this post is. I've never told anyone. And maybe I just need to get it out.

Although every other time, it was a boy i barely knew, either forcing their touch onto me, or the other way around. When i was 15, i got into a relationship with this guy, from the very beginning, there was something about him that put me off. But being young and dumb, and also very mentally unstable, i ignored this feeling. Big mistake. He became very emotionally abusive, he never hit me, just a lot of manipulation, gaslighting, and lying. That is until 2 instances. I know what happened definitely wasn’t okay, but idk i guess i just need validation that i can call this r*pe/sexual assault. The first instance, i was over at his house and having stayed up the whole night prior, i was really tired. I asked him if i could take a nap, and he said “yeah only if you let me fuck you while you sleep”, i laughed, thinking obviously hes joking, and turned over to take a nap. i woke up, hearing him laughing over me, as i came to, i felt coldness on my face. i touch my face to feel liquid all over my face. my mind immediately went to, he poured something on me. but i realized what happened once i looked at him, his penis out, and a bottle of lotion next to him. i nearly screamed and ran to the bathroom as he continued to laugh. it felt so dehumanizing. the other instance, he kept trying to get me to do anal. i didn’t want to, as id never done it before and i honestly just didn’t have any interest to. he had this big rule, the most important rule to him, dont break promises. something to do with his dead grandma idk. i know now that it was just a manipulation tactic to get what he wants. but at the time, i sympathized with him, and almost admired him for caring so much about something like a simple promise. until he promised me that i would let him do anal. i obviously denied. to which he responded, “you cant deny, if i dont get to, then that means you broke a promise, so i will break up with you” i should have left, i should have break up with me then. but i didn’t, i agreed, and the next time i went to his house, he intended to keep his promise. right when it was about to happen, i started to change my mind. as i started to protest, he forced himself in me. no lube, no nothing. it was one of the most painful things i had ever experienced. i immediately started sobbing. all he did was sit there and laugh. and went on to tell me, “you know the more you cry, the more i get turned on”. i didn’t stay long after this. these situations still haunt me to this day. please let me know im not crazy in feeling like this.","was this sa?

On the male dementia unit, a common behaviour resulting from dementia is inappropriate sexual behaviour, which I was not informed of or trained on at all prior to my shift there. During that day, I had countless inappropriate remarks made to me, attempts to kiss me, and whenever I reported it to a senior, I was told to ‘just say no’.

Any protests or reports us younger staff make are ignored, and we’re told it’s part of their condition and we have to forgive them and do our job as usual, and ‘just say no’.

I’m 19 going on 20 now. “Shockingly”, he doesn’t unwantedly kiss or hug me anymore. It’s almost like he knows I would be quick to say smth because I’m not a little kid anymore.

16194,1hzya74,post,I’ve been told so much it was…but I still feel so unsure and guilty?,"When I was 11 years old, I had a best friend, who was also 11, but a few months younger. I think the age is the main reason I second guess myself, we were BOTH children.

We were having a sleepover and watching movies in her bed, and it all seemed normal enough. But then she started acting weird and sexual, which I recognised at that age, but I didn’t know what to do. I played oblivious and got more and more anxious over the span of about half an hour, hoping she’d give up if I didn’t get the hint. 

After half an hour or so, she got annoyed and outright asked if we should have sex. I said no, we were too young, I really wasn’t sure if we should do that. I was terrified to reject her because every time i’d said no to her about anything, she’d gotten very angry and gave me silent treatment until I gave into her request. She said okay and went back to watching the movie, but asked again only a minute or two later. I rejected her again, but it kept up until I said yes. 

I hated every second of it, I just froze as she touched me and stripped me. Sometimes I still feel like she’s doing it and I get panicked, even when I’m alone. She asked me to do it to her as well, and I just wanted it to be over, so I complied. 

The next day, it happened again. I delayed it as long as I could, saying ‘maybe later’, I didn’t know what else to do. She kept pestering and getting more frustrated, and it happened again. I lost track of how many times it happened after that. The last time, when she suggested it again, I started crying, and I begged her to let me keep my bra on at least, I begged for her not to touch me, id do whatever she wanted and I’d do it for her instead, I couldn’t take it anymore. She agreed. And after that I yelled and cried and was verbally aggressive (which I never was as a shy kid) until she got the hint, and it finally stopped.

We were both so young, and I did say yes eventually, and when I was firm enough she did stop? Is that still sexual assault?","I’ve been told so much it was…but I still feel so unsure and guilty?

I played oblivious and got more and more anxious over the span of about half an hour, hoping she’d give up if I didn’t get the hint. 

After half an hour or so, she got annoyed and outright asked if we should have sex. I said no, we were too young, I really wasn’t sure if we should do that. I was terrified to reject her because every time i’d said no to her about anything, she’d gotten very angry and gave me silent treatment until I gave into her request. She said okay and went back to watching the movie, but asked again only a minute or two later. I rejected her again, but it kept up until I said yes. 

I hated every second of it, I just froze as she touched me and stripped me. Sometimes I still feel like she’s doing it and I get panicked, even when I’m alone. She asked me to do it to her as well, and I just wanted it to be over, so I complied. 

The next day, it happened again. I delayed it as long as I could, saying ‘maybe later’, I didn’t know what else to do. She kept pestering and getting more frustrated, and it happened again. I lost track of how many times it happened after that. The last time, when she suggested it again, I started crying, and I begged her to let me keep my bra on at least, I begged for her not to touch me, id do whatever she wanted and I’d do it for her instead, I couldn’t take it anymore. She agreed. And after that I yelled and cried and was verbally aggressive (which I never was as a shy kid) until she got the hint, and it finally stopped.

We were both so young, and I did say yes eventually, and when I was firm enough she did stop? Is that still sexual assault?",2,4.0,2025-01-12 22:02,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hzya74/ive_been_told_so_much_it_wasbut_i_still_feel_so/,Neutral
16196,1hzyeb2,post,Was i just exaggerating?,"
Last year about a year ago, my long-term boyfriend (33) and I (31) were walking down the street when we ran into a guy (around 48) and his girlfriend, who are in an open relationship. We've known them from going out over the past eight years, and I've known the guy for about two more years. 

He asked if he could touch my stomach, and I assumed it was because I had lost about 30kg over the last ten years. I didn't see anything weird about it at first and thought, ""Oh well, he wouldn't do anything inappropriate with my boyfriend and his girlfriend standing right next to us, right?"" But then he slid his hand from my stomach into my miniskirt. I froze for the first two seconds, then pushed him away, stepped back, and said, ""Hey, I didn't agree to that."" My boyfriend quickly responded by screaming at him, almost punching him (which was very understandable). 

The guy's girlfriend just said, ""Yeah, some people don't like that,"" as if it was the most normal situation ever. I told my boyfriend we should go to our friend who was waiting for us, who also knows the guy. The guy then said, ""So can this 'friend' also not touch you in THAT way?"" Of course, the answer is ""No"" because my boyfriend and I are not in an open relationship.

I later told some people about this situation, including those who have known him for years. Some justified his actions by saying, ""Their relationship is different from yours,"" or ""You shouldn't have dressed the way you did"" (it was hot outside, and I wore a miniskirt and a cropped t-shirt). Others said he was drunk and probably wouldn't even remember it the next day. He also kept saying things like, ""Look what a hot bitch"" and ""Damn, look at that,"" all while ""being drunk.""

I've been sexually assaulted as a child, and this hits me hard. But somehow, I keep telling myself that maybe I was just exaggerating because of my past traumas (I have C-PTSD). Maybe I provoked him by the way I was dressed, or maybe I should have said no when he asked to touch my stomach. I just can't put my finger on it.

I also need to mention that a girl we know (she was 14 at the time) had sex with this guy when he was in his mid-30s. Others who still support him told her and me that ""she wanted it herself,"" but HELLO, SHE WAS 14... WHICH MEANS SHE COULD NOT CONSENT TO A MID-30S YEAR-OLD MAN. His girlfriend actually saw him having sex with that minor and did NOTHING.

I know I might have to report this, but I'm scared. It happened a year ago, so maybe it's too long ago? He also has many connections with people we see often, and we can't just ignore all of them and ""move on."" Even now, after months, I don't know what to do with this or how to feel about it. I think the reason I'm writing this here is that I need to get this off my chest. This is such a difficult situation for me.

Has anyone else sadly experienced something similar? How did you handle it?

Feel free to share your thoughts.

this is where it gets seruous. he has been accused of rape by 3 separate girls. i have no proof of this, but only rumours. but why would 3 separate individuals accuse him of rape? with women if they reject him he turns on them & degrades tjem & hates them-to us girls of the town, he's bad news. 

however on the male side, hes in his student council & has a large group of friends. well liked by his teachers & well liked by all around-to an extent.

i want justice to be served. i want to prove that this guy is guilty, do i sent an anonymous tip off to the guards to look into this? or do i try and find who the rape victims are and work with them to speak to the guards-or cpuld i ruin my life in doing so?

16204,1i00buh,post,i can't figure out if i was raped or not,"
I'm sorry about this but i really need to ask this somewhere. Please read this whole post as it seems normal at first, but you'll see why I'm conflicted.

So, the situation is that I was at a party with a few close friends. When we're all very drunk, one friend asks me to sleep with them (they're also drunk). I say ""what do you mean,"" (as I was in disbelief) and then follow them to another room to make out. They ask for consent every time it escalates, and I say ""okay."" Obviously, eventually we go all the way. 

In retrospect, I would've never said yes if I was sober. I'm 17 and would've liked to wait until I was dating someone, plus I have other trauma and sex is a big deal (to me) etcetc. 

This person ignores me for months after it happened, and I start feeling like I've done something wrong. Eventually, at another party, some of my other friends bring me aside to talk to me about it. They were all really mad at him for how he treated me, which was crazy bcz I felt like I'd somehow done something wrong. 

I find out from my friends that, in the weeks before it happened (while completely sober ofc), he'd talked to them about his desire to sleep with either me or another of my friends behind my back to them. I also find out that he asked the other friend first (at the party where we slept together) and she said no. 

My friends told me that, after it happened, he talked to all of my friends (behind my back) about how ""he wouldn't mind if it happened again.""

I still feel like I shouldn't feel hurt. He still texts me every now and then and all my other friends still talk to him (although 2 of them recently told me they're still mad at him for what he did). Because of this, it feels like it's still ""normal,"" and if it was rape I feel like people wouldn't still be talking to him. I just don't know how to feel about this because he threw up after we slept together and I didn't, so maybe I had more control than he did somehow? Please help me.","i can't figure out if i was raped or not

16206,1i00co4,post,My dad’s house was raided by the FBI Friday night.,"I’ve been waiting for this my whole life. My dad molested me from 3-13 and when I was a girl I found CP on his kindle tablet and this was reported to DHS as well as the incident where I realized what he was doing to me. Unfounded by dhs. Well I’ve been speaking out against him for years. I have 2 younger sisters 14 and 6 who live with him part and full time. I’ve filed dhs reports and called their school guidance counselors at red flags. There have been red flags. I am not allowed contact with them by their mom or my dad. (We all have different moms)

The other day his girlfriend called my grandpa who I live with and said the FBI was searching the house and had my dad in custody. I immediately drove over to watch and they were taking totes of electronics, a safe was removed, they searched the place and took pictures. He was not arrested though after all. Still waiting for more info but that motherfucker is finally going to get nailed, they’re going to find exactly what they’re looking for.

Other info that hasn’t been added up or proven yet to mean anything but, my dad works for a security system company. He installs and manages camera and alarm systems in schools and office buildings etc. he drives a big van for work and is their “travel guy” so he’s always out of town. His whole house is monitored by camera and he can access any camera he installs. I know this because about 4 years ago my wallet was stolen and my debit card used at a laundromat his company secured. I texted him and asked if he could get footage and he sent me the guys picture and told me not to tell anyone he could get into the cameras. He’s extremely tech savvy and has always had a private area for his computer- a garage workshop in one of my childhood homes or a basement in his current one.
My little sister told me he has been sleeping during the day on the living room couch and not at night. 

I really think this is going to be a way bigger thing than touching kids and watching cp. I think that motherfuckers been involved in trafficking and I hope they nail him to the fucking wall and he dies in prison. ","My dad’s house was raided by the FBI Friday night.

16220,1i01lsx,post,my assaulter got a tattoo in support of SA,"today i found out through socials that my ex, who sexually assaulted me whilst i was sleeping over at her house as a teenager, has recently gotten a medusa tattoo and for some reason fully enraged me. she IS an assaulter and i am the proof of that, for years and years i could not let my guard down around others and this still occasionally causes me issues in current life and relationship with my girlfriend. i just feel so gross thinking about it because she knows what she did. 

for context: this was around 5-6 years ago, we were around 15, both closeted lesbians. neither of us were out to our families and this was a very new relationship framed as a friendly hangout to our parents, and she knew that i wouldn't tell anyone about what happened that night. i still haven't said a word, only a few close friends know which makes this all the more frustrating because i want to speak about this again but feel like i cant!!

i just needed to let all of that out, im sorry about the rambling but thank you for listening

16223,1i01tff,post,what happened to me destroyed me. Now I'm almost 33 and never had a job yet.,"It is what it is. I'm a woman and I'm almost 33 and never worked. I have two degrees and and master's degree so, it's not like I did nothing at all. I simply never worked. But what happened to me, although it's been years now, is still haunting me to this day. It slowed down everything, it destroyed everything I had and made me spiral, I went though some very dark times...and now I'm paying the consequences.

I live in a country where gaps on  your cv  like that are obviously heavily considered and I'm trying to apply to some jobs but no luck. It's not like I can explain why my cv look like that - though I do have some qualifications at least. I live in Italy tho, where the working situation is terrifying, I wonder if you live in places where is still considered socially acceptable to start so late in your life. I can't sleep, I can't eat, I'm devoured by anxiety. I'm even thinking of going abroad or trying a master's abroad that could be more profitable and start working. Everything to get me out of this situation because I'm scared.

Did some of you ever find yourself in a similar situation, or have you heard of people around who started everything so late in life? Did you also suffer something that made you delay a lot of things in life? Because I'm still feel so guilty about it. It's not my fault and yet I'm the only one who's being punished for what happened. Do you think there is still a place for me in the world at this age? It's crazy to think of happiness as something so small (just a job, stability, safety, calmness) and yet feel like it's so out of reach.","what happened to me destroyed me.

16226,1i028bf,post,I don't think they did it on purpose,"I'm really not sure if this counts as SA/rape because the discussion of intent is really controversial. 

This was both our first proper relationship and we had consensual sex a few times. However, there were some times where I didn't really want to, but it may have looked like I initiated? I would sometimes press myself against them in like a ""seductive"" way, but I didn't want sex, I just wanted to feel wanted and get attention, maybe make out but nothing more, I was just really awful at communicating my feelings verbally. They would sometimes ask but I don't think always, I struggle to remember that. But even when they did ask, it was more in a playful way, where they obviously assume the answer is yes and it would feel awkward to say no, instead of asking in a more serious way. The fact they didn't even wait for an answer shows it's not really a question. It's more like asking ""How are you?"" while not even stopping to hear the answer. Because I didn't answer. I was too scared to hurt their feelings and again, I was awful at communicating. It's not even that they would purposefully guilt me or whatever, I just can't handle the disappointment they would definitely feel as a consequence of rejection. So I just let it happen and told myself maybe I'll enjoy it later, which I did physically and that probably skewed my body language anyway. 

This is not about if they're in the wrong, I do recognize that it harmed me and their intent doesn't remove their responsibility for it. I'm merely asking if I can call it SA or even rape.

i (25f) moved to a new country in september. Mid september i met this guy (21m) through a mutual friend and he was very friendly and i wanted friends since i had none so i humoured him and texted him back whenever he texted me, but it was all strictly platonic. in october there was this event that his friends were holding that he told me about and i wanted to go so we went. at the event he suddenly got very touchy and close without even asking me, he would put his arm around me and grab my waist or hug me, and he’s never done any of that before. I was visibly uncomfortable and tried doing my own thing away from him but he would always follow me around. i later found out that all his friends were under the impression that we were dating. 

after the event he was really drunk but still insisted on walking me home, i told him i want to take a taxi but he refused and just insisted. so he walked me home and when we got to my building he hugged me, and wouldn’t let go for ten whole minutes. in the street. he hugged me and moaned and kissed my neck. then told me to give him a house tour and don’t ask me why i agreed i have no fucking clue, yes i’m stupid sometimes. I made him only stay in the kitchen, and told him we can’t go inside. he listened. 

then in the kitchen he started hugging me again and kissing my cheek and forehead. i learned that in a fight or flight situation, i freeze. 

he then kept saying how he wants to cuddle but i didn’t entertain that thought, i told him no. so then he sat on the floor and told me to get into his lap, facing him, with my legs around him, even though i tried to sit facing away from him he made me sit to face him. i was honestly scared and nervous, he’s bigger than me. he hugged sitting down like that and moaned a bit more. 

i got up after like a minute and asked him to leave. he asked for another hug then a kiss, and i said no. he said “next time” and i said no next time because your too young. then he hesitantly left. 

this is my fault, and it’s not as bad as it could’ve been. but why do i keep feeling disgusting and icky and nasty whenever i remember the incident or even see him or hear his voice. i just get this really uncomfortable feeling like i want to crawl out of my skin, but nothing really happened. also he’s way younger so it just feels so pathetic ","Does it even count if he’s like really young

i got up after like a minute and asked him to leave. he asked for another hug then a kiss, and i said no. he said “next time” and i said no next time because your too young. then he hesitantly left. 

this is my fault, and it’s not as bad as it could’ve been. but why do i keep feeling disgusting and icky and nasty whenever i remember the incident or even see him or hear his voice. i just get this really uncomfortable feeling like i want to crawl out of my skin, but nothing really happened. also he’s way younger so it just feels so pathetic ",2,4.0,2025-01-13 2:51,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1i047z3/does_it_even_count_if_hes_like_really_young/,Neutral
16242,1i04ge2,post,Being intimate for the first time after my rapes & SA’s. ,"So, my partner and I have been dating for about 2weeks now. But, things have been progressing between us since September. We weren’t a couple, we were just casually dating and nothing went past “middle school” stuff. We held hands, cuddled and that’s about it. We had our first kiss on New Year’s Eve at midnight exactly. 
Anyways, fast forward to now…and we are sexually active. This is my first consensual time, since my sexual assaults last year(2024). Well every time I’m sexually active with them, I get very anxious & my entire body shakes like a leaf. I honestly don’t know why. My boyfriend is trans, ftm. And we used a vibrator for my first time since my rapes(well twice we used it. The first time I didn’t tell him it was my first time with a vibrator. The second time I told him it was my first time ever even using one). We’ve had sex before this, but this was way more intimate and serious? I guess? 

Usually because of my traumas, vaginismis and anxiety…. Men or whoever I’m having sex with can’t get anything inside me (including fingers is painful) but he was able to stick the vibrator inside me with no issues, I didn’t even feel it go inside me but I knew it was. 

I was never one to be intimate with myself, like I pleased myself with my fingers but that was it. And even that was painful. I love and trust my boyfriend so much, but I’m also scared of intimacy everytime we’ve had sex. It’s only been like 4 times that we’ve done anything. And I’m just…full of flashbacks, anxiety and depression. I don’t know or understand why… because I felt so comfortable with my partner. And I was so happy to just be with him. He’s the first partner I’ve ever been able to go all the way with, but still feels shy and nervous. 
My partner knows about my past experiences and they also have a past with SA as well. They were raped too. The only thing I don’t think they fully “get” and understand is the fast that I was raped and SAed as a child, and teenager. They weren’t. They’re lucky that no one ever touched them inappropriately as a child… that I know of anyways. 

Anyways…does anyone else deal with anxiety and nervousness during and after being intimate? How did you cope with it? ","Being intimate for the first time after my rapes & SA’s.

16245,1i04omp,post,I need advice ASAP,"Please read, I’m sorry it’s long but I’m desperate. I have no one else to advise me.

I am an 18 year old female. I was in Xanax withdrawals at my parents house on 20/12/2024. I left as I felt so unwell. I expressed that I wanted to go to my flat to smoke weed as it was the only thing helping with my withdrawals. My parents didn’t mind and said I could go. In fact, my dad gives me weed.

As I’m going downstairs, I bump into a neighbour; a man in his 50s who I’ve always trusted as he watched me grow up all my life from early childhood. He starts talking and I tell him I’m unwell so I’m going to go back to my flat to smoke (I trusted him and knew he smoked weed too, so wouldn’t judge). He then offered to have a quick smoke with me before I went home. I said yes. I thought we would just smoke in the block because that’s where we started smoking, but then he said we should take the joints to his car as he will give me a lift to my flat. I wasn’t in a position to turn down the offer of a free ride to my flat as I was exhausted from the withdrawals, so I said yes. 

I got into his car and I’m still smoking. He starts to say he wants to take me clubbing sometime, where he said he will buy me the most expensive alcohol, cocaine, and ecstasy. This isn’t the first time he’s mentioned wanting to do these drugs with me; when he first mentioned them, I said I didn’t want to because of fear as my dad has had a heart attack from cocaine before.

He said he wants to get me massaged before we go and to go to a hotel after the club for a personal “after party” entailing heavy amounts of cocaine and ecstasy; “as much as [I] want”. I felt uncomfortable as I didn’t know what his intentions were at this point (I’m autistic and it’s something I struggle with). 

Then I realise he keeps putting his hands on my inner thigh. I shuffle in my seat and lean my head against the window. Before he went in depth about his plans for clubbing with me, he was asking me if I’m a good kisser. He also said he wanted to know if I was a good kisser, and I felt so uncomfortable, I didn’t know how to answer him. He also made several attempts to kiss me around/on my lips and put his forehead on mine, laughing, smiling and staring at me. 

He stops the car, but not outside my flat. I ask him where we are and he said that he stopped to pick up weed. I felt as though I couldn’t argue with him on that as he was giving me a free ride so I said it was okay. So I got out of the car with him, and we go into a shop. He brought me a box of cigarettes and a vape, even though I said I could pay but he insisted. Then, when he brought the weed, he had brought me a bag when I didn’t even ask for it. I said thank you to be kind, but I was weirded out. I didn’t understand why he did that. 

Then we get back into his car and rather than dropping me home he says we should park somewhere and smoke in the car. Again, I felt as though I could say nothing as I was accepting a free ride so I said that it was okay. We parked in a parking lot and he started to roll the joints. He put pressure on me to smoke, but I honestly wasn’t in the mood in that moment and just wanted to get home. I smoked anyways for two reasons: so he would smoke less and not be too high to drive, and because I felt pressured. 

However, this made me very drowsy, especially since I was in withdrawals, had already smoked, the car was hot with closed windows, and I have insomnia, which he’s aware of. 

I rested my head on my lap/knees, hunched over in the car seat. He kept telling me to relax and said he’ll be able to send me to sleep, so he started to unbuckle my seatbelt and roll up my top. I couldn’t move as my body was so exhausted. He then started massaging my back, but I was uncomfortable by the way he touched me. He said he was going to press on different pressure spots to send me to sleep, and I could feel his hands touching my waist and the sides of my breasts, so I pressed my arms against my sides so he couldn’t. He kept asking if he was hurting me, but I had no energy to speak. So he continued, making me feel more uncomfortable. 

I eventually gained the strength to sit up in my seat, stopping him. He then drove me back to my flat, after taking several wrong turns and prolonging the car ride intentionally, and he kept making me promise not to tell my parents about the clubbing night he has planned, which he described as what would be “the wildest night of [my] life” and “a night [id] never forget”. I left his car, feeling uncomfortable, confused, and violated. Was what he did inappropriate? Or am I overthinking it?

He also made references about how he was looking at pictures of me and my little sister (who’s now 15) from when we were young children (younger than 9) with his cousin, who is also an older man. This cousin referred to me in the pictures as the man’s “little girlfriend” which seemed to please him when he brought it up as it made him smile and laugh again, but I just felt disgusted really.

I tried to tell my parents but they don’t believe me. I feel so alone, but I know I can keep myself safe from him as I don’t live anywhere near him now. Im scared for my little sister as she lives in the same block as him and he always tries to talk to her and hug her when he sees her. I can’t keep her safe and neither can my parents (but they can’t by choice), so I don’t know what to do or make of the situation.","I need advice ASAP Please read, I’m sorry it’s long but I’m desperate.

Feeling dirty after SA is normal, and it’s something you can get accustomed to if it doesn’t go away. For me it hasn’t, but there’s no guarantee of that for you, especially since you’re handling this well enough to talk about it so soon afterwards.

And stop self-deprecating. You let him in your place because you were uncomfortable and stressed, you just did the first thing that you could think to do after a very uncomfortable and difficult night of stress. You’re not stupid. Being touched without consent doesn’t make you pathetic either. You are a victim and survivor of sexual assault, by a grown adult.

16252,1i05ejf,post,"he came, i cried","Last night, I (26f) invited a guy (25m) over that I’ve known online for about a year. We made plans to hang out, and I invited him over. 

He arrived around 8pm and we were talking until 2am. I genuinely enjoyed my time with him and felt attracted to him. 

He eventually fell asleep on my couch around 3 and woke up a few minutes later. I let him know that I’m going to bed and told him he’s welcome to stay if he’s too tired to drive home (30 min drive). We went to my room, talked a little longer, then this is when it all went down. 

He kissed my neck, I kissed him, he took lead, got on top of me, took my shorts and underwear off, put on a condom, and put it right in. 

My shirt wasn’t even off. There was 0 foreplay. From the moment I kissed him til the moment he came, MAYBE 5 minutes passed. I feel like he literally just masturbated inside me.

Here’s where I’m struggling: I never wanted to have sex with him. Something I want to make clear though is I’m upset with my own lack of actions. It just happened so fast. When he was grabbing the condom i was literally thinking to myself “you should say something now”, but I didn’t. 

i’ve had healthy, casual sex in the past, but i’m not as interested in it anymore, and even then, it was with people that I wanted to do that with. so i’ve been abstaining for a few months now. 

I question if I would’ve felt better afterwards if the sex was better. I mean, maybe? But not really. I would’ve felt better communicating about it first, which would’ve led to me saying no. 

When we were (when he was) done, he was ready to go another round. I took some time to get myself together in the bathroom while he was laying down. I laid down next to him, we chatted a little bit, then boom, I start crying. It wasn’t like a boohoo cry, just tears falling. I told him that I prefer to be alone tonight and that I feel a bit overwhelmed and emotional, basically requesting that he leaves. He seemed understanding about it and respected my honesty, but kept saying “stop crying”, “you’re making me feel bad”, instead of putting effort into understanding why I’m upset. 

This is such an icky feeling. We should’ve hung out in public, but honestly I’ve been desperate for some intimacy like cuddling and deep convos. 

I feel stupid. I didn’t stick up for myself when i should have, and even though i verbalized that i am overwhelmed and obviously emotional, that person didn’t seem to care. 

we texted a bit today. He asked if I was okay and said he felt like he did something wrong. I told him I cried because i realized i wasn’t fully comfortable having sex so it brought unexpected emotions in the moment. 

aaaaaand no response. 

with him seeming not-phased by it, kinda makes me feel even more shitty about myself and embarrassed honestly. 

has anyone else had a similar moment? should i feel the shame i feel because i cried in front of someone i met for the first time? 

i have been sexually assaulted before that i haven’t even brought up with a therapist. sometimes i wonder if moments similar to the story i told (not saying it is sexual assault) are a trigger. i am seeing a therapist consistently, maybe it’s time to finally talk about it.

I laid down next to him, we chatted a little bit, then boom, I start crying. It wasn’t like a boohoo cry, just tears falling. I told him that I prefer to be alone tonight and that I feel a bit overwhelmed and emotional, basically requesting that he leaves. He seemed understanding about it and respected my honesty, but kept saying “stop crying”, “you’re making me feel bad”, instead of putting effort into understanding why I’m upset. 

This is such an icky feeling. We should’ve hung out in public, but honestly I’ve been desperate for some intimacy like cuddling and deep convos. 

I feel stupid. I didn’t stick up for myself when i should have, and even though i verbalized that i am overwhelmed and obviously emotional, that person didn’t seem to care. 

we texted a bit today. He asked if I was okay and said he felt like he did something wrong. I told him I cried because i realized i wasn’t fully comfortable having sex so it brought unexpected emotions in the moment. 

aaaaaand no response. 

with him seeming not-phased by it, kinda makes me feel even more shitty about myself and embarrassed honestly. 

has anyone else had a similar moment? should i feel the shame i feel because i cried in front of someone i met for the first time? 

i have been sexually assaulted before that i haven’t even brought up with a therapist. sometimes i wonder if moments similar to the story i told (not saying it is sexual assault) are a trigger. i am seeing a therapist consistently, maybe it’s time to finally talk about it.

16289,1i0874l,post,I’m unsure of a situation ,"Recently I went to a friend house to hang out and smoke, when I got there her roommate had friends over who were also smoking. There was a mix of guys and girls and while I was uncomfortable at first we moved to my friend bedroom and I felt better. I smoked way too much and asked my friend if it was ok for me to use a room to nap and sleep off the worst of the high. She let me sleep in her room and left so I could rest. All I remember is falling asleep and then waking up with a horrible taste in my mouth and my chest really hurting. The taste was definitely not the after taste of a high but was salty and felt like I had gargled chlorine in my mouth and slimy. My lower hips and other area was also sore but I had my clothes on still. I immediately freaked out and left to go home, I went home and inspected my chest and saw small marks and I had a rash on my very upper inner thighs (I’m allergic to latex). I called her trying not to cry and asked if anyone came into her room but she wasn’t sure since she also was super high but said she would ask around and hasn’t responded to me since. I broke down and told my roommate and he said that it could’ve been a bad trip and I could’ve been having a reaction to something else. I’m also grappling with if something did happen was I too high to remember consenting? I only remember falling asleep but I’m having these moments where my brain sends me these flashes and my stomach immediately drops and I feel sick. I truly don’t know what happened and it’s freaking me out. My roommate said that while if something did happen it wouldn’t be my fault but I did put myself in that situation by getting that high around people I didn’t really know.

16310,1i0brjm,post,I honestly didn't know where else to go (I'm sorry if this is offensive to those who've actually been assualted),"TL;DR: My older cousin and his friend were trying to teach me and the friend's little sister to have sex in order for them to masturbate to us. They also taught me how ti masturbate



My girlfriend and I were talking about sexual experiences and I told her that I first almost lost my virginity when I was around 5 or 6 and then a few times after that, but still very young. I explained everything to her and she hugged me and said I was assaulted but I thought she was overreacting and that it wasn’t true. This is what I told her:

I had a cousin who was about 10 years older than me so he was 16 at the time. We'll call him Roy. Roy had a friend who was a year older and he was 17. We'll call him Orange. Orange had a younger sister who was exactly my age, down to the month as well. We'll call her Apple. Long story short, Roy and Orange set me up with Apple and they were teaching us how to have sex. 

Prior to this, Roy and Orange had already introduced me to porn and had taught me how to masturbate and so they used to show me those porn videos. I was willing to do all that cuz I wanted to be ""adults"" like them even tho they weren’t I just wanted to be cool so I would ask them to see more videos and they would happily oblige. 

So one day Roy and Orange put on some porn that was on one of their laptops and they started masturbating. I tried but gave up cuz it felt weird. I was still erect the whole time through, though. Apple came in and she got involved. She wasn't masturbating but she watched with us. Roy and Orange then started telling us to emulate what was happening in the videos so they could cum to us doing it and they were trying to teach us some styles and positions. Apple and I happily obliged and tried but it was too painful for her so we ultimately abandoned it. They taught her how to give me oral and vice versa. They also made us kiss which is the only thing I was opposed to. That exact scenario happened many more times until we were around 12 and we stopped trying and being sexual with each other.

I never penetrated since it always hurt her too much so I consider myself a virgin still. My girlfriend is insisting that I've been assaulted but I don't think so since they weren't really doing it with us they were teaching us to do it so they could masturbate to us. The only lasting side effect that I can feel is hypersexuality that's plagued me since those days. I'm not going to lie, when my girlfriend hugged me I think I teared up a bit but aside from that I feel fine.

Again sorry if I am diluting the sub with such things and I'm not going to ever claim I have went through what others have went through. My heart genuinely aches for the people here. I just didn't really know where to go since the rape sub seemed to extreme.

16312,1i0brn6,post,Was this SA or am I making it up in my head?,"Sorry about the long read I just haven't had a therapist or anyone really validate if this was SA and I don't feel comfortable telling people. I've also had this 1 guy who I think also ""SA'D"" me say some of it wasn't SA. I feel like because NONE of these are forced attempts my trauma isn't valid because some people are forced to have sex. You don't have to read all of them but pls read atleast some? ;_;? Was any of this SA or am I only thinking its SA because I've convinced myself it was and I'm rolling with it?  

These are only some of the times im sure there's more I just can't remember them rn. 

-Partners having sex with me when I was a combination or 1 of these- in pain, dissociating, star fishing, freezing, going mute, asking if they were nearly done and saying it hurt. There was times they did stop or asked if I wanted them to stop so it invalidates my feelings. It hurt so badly and they knew I don't feel vaginal pleasure but I felt like I had to because I was so scared of being abandoned.

- ill name him J2-Me coming onto them and giving full consent even when asked ""if I was sure"" when I was so drunk I could barley lift my head because I was performing 


-J2 telling him not to jerk off infront of him and him saying how it wasn't that deep and I should just let him do it (he said other stuff after that made me feel horrible for not letting him)

-First sexual encounter with this guy (ill name him J1) invited me over and I thought he had others at the house but turns out we were home alone and he kept flirting with me and I freaked out scared he would react badly if I went home or put a stop to his flirting. He kept giving me cones/his drinks he didn't want anymore and then I agreed to go to his room with him and I set my boundry saying  I just wanted dnms/cuddles he kept touching my breasts/vulva and I had to tell him no. I was also visibly more drunk than him He got upset i didn't touch him me even tho I told him how ""he could touch me but I wouldn't touch him because I wasn't comfortable and if he was jelouse then don't touch me. 

Anyway, I told J1 I have severe sexual anxiety and I NEEDED exposure therapy and it would take us ageees to do certain things he kept trying to push sex onto me and NOT do it at the pace I was comfortable despite him agreeing to doing exposure therapy with me (systematic desensitisation) he told me how he genuinely thought he could help me and it hurt that he went against it

-Similar experience as (ill name him J2) ^ but he did a similar same thing J2 started touching me without asking me and said he could just touch the outside after. I agreed to touch his penis and then him getting it out to ""fix the postion of it"" last second and me touching it and age regressing then him accusing me of faking regressing and saying how selfish I was being and started ranting about how self absorbed today's kids were (he was 6 years older than me and I was just 21/in a chain of abusive relationships). 

J1 also jerked off after touching me without asking me even tho I told him that was something that freaked me out from. J2 . He legit just did it without any warning 

-J2- we did oral and I was wasted but unable to sit up and he told me he was fully sober I did consent prior to getting drunk and during but didn't know he was sober. He tried having sex with me even after leaving me alone for a bit saying he could ""be on top because I was too drunk"" after initially telling him before he left me alone i was to drunk to be on top 

-Back to J1 sorry 😅I told him how I didn't want to have sex and just to hang out as friends and he kept trying to get me to go upstairs to his room when we were supposed to be studying ""too bad my laptop is upstairs"" and every time I freaked out/started panicking and showed hesitance he just told me ""its okay its okay "" and continued to go further and further. He took my undies off and when I asked for them back he straight up said no he had taken my underwear off multiple times without asking me and telling him how terrified I was of sex stuff 

Anyways i told J1 the story of J2 when we had sex when I was drunk and he told me how it wasn't SA and how ""some people like to get drunk to relax beforehand"" I have a feeling he fed me drinks/weed so I would be more willing to have sex with me despite him saying it was because he was  just being nice/finnished drinking 

-same guy^ he kept trying to go down on me and I said no or said I was scared and he went into the position to go down on me and said ""you can tell me to stop at anytime"" this guy knows I struggle with boundries. I also said I did want to try touching him and if he could move my hand down instead of me going until his boxers but he said ""i want you to take it out I think that would be hot"" completely ignoring what I said b4 

-same guy but we were in my car and I went against my boundries again and i told him I had my sedative medication (so I only had some time b4 they kicked in) and he kept asking me if we could have penatrive sex and how penatrive sex is only pleasurable for the male and its like a sacrifice to pleasure them. He also said phrases like ""just the tip, can we just try it? I'll be quick"" 

-said how I kept hiving him blue balls and what could I do for him? 

- we were also sexting and i told him I *only* sexy pics and he kept demanding ? ""I want you to touch yourself"" ""fuck your university assigment (that was due btw) come over"" ""fuck your new healing lip piercings ""
he told me he was dominant but ik for a fact that isn't how bdsm works 

J1- i was drunk and lonely and invited him over. I can't remember much because I was drunk and dissociated I think because I was in a my crisis and I needed someone and as soon as he came over he locked my door and stared spanking me and throwing me around slighlty and he took my under wear/his? But he put his penis right at the entrance of my vagina and felt him resit pushing and I confusingly said ""whats happening?"" And he just said"" it'll be okay"" I agreed verbally too but because I was curious so ig this one wasn't SA but he knew I was drunk and very hesitant. I was so dissociated and he eventually stopped and then used all my baby wipes and just put them on my table and asked me to ""suck his dick"" even tho I couldn't even have penatrive sex 

My first Partner withdrawing attention from me/ghosting me and ignoring me and getting upset on ""how others have sex every day but we don't ""
I also remember being so scared when he would come onto me atleast twice a deal and feeling like i had to perform (these memories are blury) but I remember feeling pressured either internally or from him 

-in an extremely abusive relationship he came onto me and I said no so we just went to bed and he shut down and I noticed he was macerating/watching porn snd i tried cuddling him and he yelled at me saying how ""retarted"" I was for trying to cuddle when he was doing that then went into the spare room (which he knows triggers me because I have bpd/abaodnment issues) and when I finnaly went in nearly 40 minutes later it was like he was waiting for me? He still had porn on even tho he denied watching it and I just said ""if have sex with me will you come to bed) and I laid down and he instantly got ontop of me and started having sex and I was super dissociating and I wiped my tears on his arm and he didn't stop. He came back to my room and just said ""i love you"" 

-Same super abusive relationship where he kept trying to give me oral and I tried pushing him off but he kept going until I gave in. I remember feeling so icky after and not knowing he pushed my boundries.","Was this SA or am I making it up in my head? Sorry about the long read I just haven't had a therapist or anyone really validate if this was SA and I don't feel comfortable telling people. I've also had this 1 guy who I think also ""SA'D"" me say some of it wasn't SA. I feel like because NONE of these are forced attempts my trauma isn't valid because some people are forced to have sex. You don't have to read all of them but pls read atleast some? ;_;? Was any of this SA or am I only thinking its SA because I've convinced myself it was and I'm rolling with it?  

These are only some of the times im sure there's more I just can't remember them rn. 

-Partners having sex with me when I was a combination or 1 of these- in pain, dissociating, star fishing, freezing, going mute, asking if they were nearly done and saying it hurt. There was times they did stop or asked if I wanted them to stop so it invalidates my feelings. It hurt so badly and they knew I don't feel vaginal pleasure but I felt like I had to because I was so scared of being abandoned.

- ill name him J2-Me coming onto them and giving full consent even when asked ""if I was sure"" when I was so drunk I could barley lift my head because I was performing 


-J2 telling him not to jerk off infront of him and him saying how it wasn't that deep and I should just let him do it (he said other stuff after that made me feel horrible for not letting him)

-First sexual encounter with this guy (ill name him J1) invited me over and I thought he had others at the house but turns out we were home alone and he kept flirting with me and I freaked out scared he would react badly if I went home or put a stop to his flirting. He kept giving me cones/his drinks he didn't want anymore and then I agreed to go to his room with him and I set my boundry saying  I just wanted dnms/cuddles he kept touching my breasts/vulva and I had to tell him no. I was also visibly more drunk than him He got upset i didn't touch him me even tho I told him how ""he could touch me but I wouldn't touch him because I wasn't comfortable and if he was jelouse then don't touch me.

16321,1i0ced4,post,"my dad is a predator and I'm scared he's been creeping on me, too","I hope this flair is appropriate. To summarise the key points as best I can: my dad has always been very weird. leaving porn on his desktop monitor while the door was wide open for my brother and i to see, giving us his phone to play on with thousands of pornographic images in the notifications bar (as file downloads) and in his gallery. He also frequently made sexual comments to me from a young age - comments about me having sex with fictional characters I liked, fetish jokes that flew over my head, and constantly insisting that all my friends must find him sexually attractive. He also always told me bedtime stories where i was a bit of a dumb blonde damsel being victimised by some male villain, despite how visibly upset I was at that. He would also - as recently as a few years back - grab my dolls/toys and act out sex and on one occasion rape. He argued with me on the definition of rape and consent, knowing I'm a survivor, while calling me names for refusing to engage with him on the topic. Ah, and once he stole my hard drive and loaded it with porn of my mum who he'd just divorced. 

The last time I tried to watch TV with him, a sex scene happened, and he repeatedly asked if I was ""into that"" while leaning in and laughing. I told my mum on the drive home from his house, and she said it's what he used to do to her.

I knew I'd been subjected to emotional incest, but after discovering my dad's poorly-hidden stash of incest porn, deepfakes of women he knows IRL, and AI chatbots... one of whom shares a name with his sister, and another (though she doesn't seem sexual) that has my name... I've been really, really re-thinking shit. 

The last straw that made me post this was a picture in his hard drive of me, ass-up at the beach, captuoned ""I LOVE THIS :)"" by him, and another with my ass facing the camera as I was in bed - this one in a folder labelled ""pictures to sell"".

I've already cut him off, but he keeps trying to get back into my life. Why I still have access to these photos is I took a bunch of pictures of his drives contents as evidence before I never went back. I was terrified for the safety of the women he was seemingly stalking and creating shrines to, but now I'm scared for myself. So... was this grooming?

16323,1i0ckwv,post,I didnt know it was r*pe until years later,"Throwaway for obvious reasons

I was just 16 and didn’t know better. He was 28. We met at a mutual friend’s party and swapped numbers.

Soon after we started dating, although he asked me not to tell anybody as they wouldn’t understand. Of course I followed. In my eyes, he could never be wrong.

The first time we did it, I wanted him to stop right when he inserted himself because it just hurt. But he didn’t. He said it’s normal, the pleasure is in the pain. So again, I accepted that.

We continued seeing each other for two years. He violated my consent countless times to the point that I just accepted that as the norm.

Now I know what all that was. And I feel repulsed that a grown man could exploit a young teen like that. And yet, sometimes I lie awake at night and I almost miss his touch. I know enough to not blame myself for how I feel and yet I cant help feeling disgusted at myself.

Last evening I found out he got married and all these memories and feelings are haunting me again.","I didnt know it was r*pe until years later Throwaway for obvious reasons

My boyfriend and I are pretty well in lack of better ways to describe it sexual with each other (I’m pretty sure it’s us both being hyper sexual due to us being SA’d by previous partners).

So usually i would be all for it, I guess that’s what I’m trying to say.

There’s a couple cases where I said explicitly no sex. 

1. I was on my period, we kissed we made out, he knew I didn’t want to have period sex so despite him yaknow being ‘ready’ he never pushed anything like that on me.

2. I had a nasty UTI.
We kissed we cuddled.
He admitted later that he had hoped i would give him head but he never brought it up.
Overall he coddled me and treated me like a little baby instead of pushing anything sexual advances. (So much so that I fell asleep watching tv with him and woke up ever so slightly to him playing with my hair and kissing me on the forehead)

So yes kissing doesn’t always turn to sex."," F, 18.

16332,1i0eqqf,post,TW: think I was SA:d tonight and I feel like crap ,"I dont know if I am overreacting but I feel miserable right now. I feel like I want to peel my skin of and can't stop crying. I just need to vent.

Long story short. I (F28) was SA:d when I was 15 by my first boyfriend. From the start i learned that my will was nothing that matters. When I was 20 I was in a long relationship containing both s*xual, psychological and in the end physical abuse. After that I had a real bad relation to s*x and developed chronic physical problems ""down there"".

I had a fwb 2021. We have known each other for many years with a good relationship. We met some weeks ago, just cuddling nothing else. That felt ok. Then we met again, one thing lead to another and we had s*x, he was kind and asked if it was ok when we did things. 

Yesterday we met again. I was not feeling alright, with severe headache. Just wanted cuddling and someone to hug me. He slept over after some discussion. And I havent slept all night, because he has been all over me with his hands and D. Between my legs. Pushing it against me the entire night. Wanted me to hold it, forced my hand down. Layed on top of me pushing his D against my V. I said no. He accepted it for like 10 minutes and then he was all over me again. With my past experiences laying completely still has been my reaction to SA. This happened this time too, but I also told him to stop several times. I hoped it would make him stop when I didn't interact. But he continued. He said ""I am just teasing you, I can control myself, because I havent put it inside of you, right?"". It felt so wrong and I just wanted to scream and cry, but we've known each other for so long and I consider(ed) him a friend so I didn't want to make a scene. I just layed there waiting for him to leave in the morning.

I tried to call my psychiatric clinic, they don't answer. I don't want to report it. I have no one to talk to because my friends know him as well. I am just alone with my thoughts, feeling schocked nauseous and my body makes me feel sick.

16339,1i0ff8o,post,Telling people about my sa/sc,"TW: mentions of sa, long text. 

When I talk about my SA in real life, outside of anonymous spaces like Reddit, it feels so weird. I tend to overshare—it’s like I have verbal diarrhea, lol. The thing is, in those moments, I just wanted someone to hear me out or give me advice. Sometimes, I didn’t feel embarrassed sharing, but now I regret telling certain people, like my mom’s friend and my older sister.

The SA/coercion feels humiliating to me because it was “just” oral—like face f\*cking. Maybe the way I worded it when I shared made it sound like I was somehow in the wrong, I know I was in the wrong too. It’s hard because, in hindsight, I keep thinking I could’ve stopped it, said no, or given myself more respect—but I didn’t. At the time, I felt like I needed to go along with it to please him, to make him feel better, and to make the situation feel less bad. I think I was trying to take control in some way, to erase the boundary that had already been violated. But admitting that out loud feels so wrong and weird.

My older sister said there’s something in me that made me go along with it like something I must heal within myself, and  she’s right. I’ve been thinking it could be because I was sheltered growing up, because I don’t have much experience with men, or because I’ve been a people pleaser my whole life. I’ve always given so much of myself emotionally, only for people to leave once they’ve taken all they could. I let people say or do whatever to me, and I never stand up for myself.

Looking back, it was my first time out with a man, and I feel so embarrassed sharing these things. My mom’s friend was really supportive when I first opened up to her, but during our last conversation, I told her about my realization that it was sexual coercion or assault. She said something about me not guarding myself. At first, I thought she meant I didn’t guard my heart, but now I think she meant I let my guard down completely.

I also have a few online friends—three of them are guys I met on a virtual game.

\- I told one of them about the situation, and he said, “Well, to him, you didn’t stop him,” and, “You learned your lesson.” I agreed and said I did learn my lesson, but that response still sits with me uneasily.

\- Another guy friend told me it sounded like borderline rape because consent wasn’t clearly established. At first, I told him about the sexual interaction as if it were just a normal story, because I didn’t have anyone else to talk to about it....  Initially, he seemed turned on by it, saying, “That I learned a new skill” it was funny.

\- The third guy friend was more straightforward. He told me I should have mentioned that I was a virgin or inexperienced, and that men could take advantage of me because of that. At the time, I thought it was important to tell men those things.

But looking back at my first date or whatever that was.... was he really “teaching me” by face f\*cking me? I realize now I was downplaying the situation, giving it the benefit of the doubt, and responding with trauma-induced coping mechanisms.

I was okay with the kissing, but when he wanted me to “practice” a BJ or started face f\*cking me, I felt this overwhelming pressure, like I had no choice but to go along with it. It was like I *had* to do it.

It’s so much to process, and I still feel conflicted, ashamed, and overwhelmed.

I had an exhausting and invalidating exchange with someone who dismissed my experience of sexual coercion and repeatedly blamed me for what happened. From the beginning, he accused me of being in ""victim mode,"" claiming I was manifesting abuse and generalizing all men based on one bad experience. I explained that healing is not linear and that reflecting on what happened is part of my process, but he dismissed it, telling me to ""snap out of it"" and accusing me of indulging in self-pity.

At one point, he falsely claimed I sent nudes to the man who sa'd me, which wasn’t true. I clarified that the guy who SA’d me used to threaten to block me if I didn’t send him the porn gifs and videos of his choice. He called them “homework,” demanding six gifs and three videos daily, which became mentally exhausting and degrading. I went along with his demands at the time because I was plotting to meet him in person to get revenge or hurt his pockets as in making him spend money on me. I even vented about this plan on another Reddit account, expressing my frustration and pain over what happened. However, I eventually couldn’t hold onto the revenge plan because his constant, vile requests took such a toll on me that I had to cut ties for my own mental health.

Despite all this, the person I was messaging ignored the context and continued to blame me, saying I was willingly engaging and needed to take full responsibility. I told him I already acknowledged the role I played and that healing requires processing and learning from my experiences, but he refused to listen. Instead, he fixated on irrelevant details like my physical appearance, suggesting I was hiding online because I couldn’t get dates, and even asked for a photo of me, claiming it would help him “empathize"" after I said he lacked empathy.

He also suggested I only attract predators because of my supposed lack of experience with men, making dismissive comments about me being ""weird"" or ""close-minded"" for growing up sheltered. When I expressed anger at his condescension and lack of empathy, he twisted it into a sign of depression and mocked me for being ""obsessed"" with my trauma.

At one point, he shared a story about pouring beer over a woman’s head as a “quirky” gesture to get her to swim with him, revealing how little he understood about respect or boundaries. He framed his dismissive comments as tough love, saying he was just being honest, but his words only reinforced how judgmental and condescending he was.

I tried to explain the nuances of trauma, such as how people-pleasing and fawning are natural coping mechanisms for many survivors, but he ignored this and continued to accuse me of playing the victim. His complete disregard for the complexity of my experience and his repeated dismissal of my healing process made it clear he wasn’t interested in meaningful dialogue or understanding.

By the end, I ended the conversation, realizing it was going nowhere.

\----

Overall...

I feel scarred by the  experience I had. I wish I hadn’t gone along with it or anything. I wish I had stood my ground. I wish I hadn’t gone on the date and humiliated myself like this. I wish I had swiped left when I saw his atrocious nose in that photo. I wish I hadn’t mentioned that I was a virgin. I wish I hadn’t ignored the red flags, thinking they were just talk when they weren’t.

I wish I had been strong enough to say no or move my face away. Maybe I was just too naive, thinking we’d go on a real date afterward. I wish I wasn’t so stupid. There are so many thoughts running through my mind, and I can’t stop wishing I’d done things differently.","Telling people about my sa/sc TW: mentions of sa, long text.

16347,1i0gyzp,post,Something is wrong with me (Massive TW),"There are two adults in my life who I´ve always been terrified of. A distant uncle of mine and a primary school PE teacher. 

I´ve always exhibited (since about the age of 4-5 years old) extreme sexual behaviors. I would masturbate to the point of self injury, bruising and needing medical attention. I am talking up to 30 times a day, regardless of how painful it would get. There was also no way of redirecting it, no matter how hard anyone tried, and I did it in public as well. 

Throughout my whole childhood UTIs were my best friend. I couldn´t go a month or two without having one. 

As young as 8 years old, I was teaching classmates how to masturbate, telling them if they rubbed themselves it would feel very nice, but not to tell because ""it´s my secret""

Ever since I moved to a different country with my parents I´ve been plagued by horrific nightmares where I am being either directly or indirectly sexually abused by the previously mentioned PE teacher, or the distant uncle.

Whenever I now masturbate, regardless if on my own or with my boyfriend, I then feel a wave of disgust towards myself, anxiety and I feel like crying. It is significantly worse if I am with my boyfriend, and when it happens I both want to be left alone but also crave physical contact such as hugging.

Any kind of sexualisation of myself (such as being called hot, sexy, or even the thought that my boyfriend may think of me sexually) terrifies me and makes me feel too anxious to entertain the thought. ""Pet names"" are also unmanageable, and at the sight of a pet name through text, or hearing one, I will immediately feel sick and emotionally detached.

As for those two people I mentioned. I have memories as young as 3 years old of me running away terrified, crying, from my uncle, while he chased me to (literally) tickle me. He would hold me down and tickle me, no matter how much I begged him to stop. To this day, 15 years later, I still cannot go near him, and I feel a wave of terror whenever I see him.

My PE teacher was known for being overly friendly with kids, but me especially, he used to run after me during and after class, calling me his love and hugging me and kissing me. I have a distinct memory of me being in a locker room alone with him in the dark, and my mother confirmed it did happen, but no one knows what happened in that locker room. The teacher said he put me there during class to ""calm me down"" and the only memory I have of ever being with him outside of class was me being called down to him and then being late to class afterwards, but the contents of the actual meeting are nonexistent in my head. I was terrified of him, so whenever I saw him I would run away, but for some reason I would feel both terrified and like I wanted to laugh. So I would be screaming and running away, while my mouth laughed. That still happened the last time I saw him, 6 years ago.

I first started having conscious doubts of my situation when I was 13. I started recovering weird memories of grooming by the PE teacher (this was confirmed by my mother, who did witness his hugging, kissing and pet name calling, as well as his blatant favoritism of me among the 27 other children in my class) as well as a weird gut feeling that something happened to me. But because I remember no clear instance of actual rape or sexual assault, I am scared it´s a false memory, and I am causing all the ""symptoms"" myself.

I know these things should not be dug up (the one time I tried I ended up having a massive dissociative episode and was hospitalised for 3 days), but now that I have a boyfriend, I am noticing more and more instances of myself just completely dissociating from reality back into some weird past experience I can only feel the emotions of. 

What adds to the confusion is that I was sexually abused in the summer by my ex, so now I can´t even tell if the current issues are that or if there´s more (my symptoms are long term since childhood, but I fear the current severity is the recent SA).

Please someone help me. The only time I talked to a therapist about it, she kept asking me to give her details. Close my eyes and think. I ended up having a panic attack and never told a therapist ever again. I eventually asked for a gynaecological appointment to see if there was any evidence of CSA (since I have never had sex, my hymen should be intact) but as soon as she started the exam, I started feeling terrified and a wave of pain hit me and I started screaming like I was being killed. My mother said it was heard in the whole clinic. I never went back.

I don´t know what to do anymore. I feel like something happened, and there is some evidence it did, but I might be grasping at straws, or making it up, or it might be nothing and just the ""garden variety"" emotional and psychological and physical abuse that led to my CPTSD in the first place.

Please please please help me","Something is wrong with me (Massive TW) There are two adults in my life who I´ve always been terrified of. A distant uncle of mine and a primary school PE teacher. 

I´ve always exhibited (since about the age of 4-5 years old) extreme sexual behaviors. I would masturbate to the point of self injury, bruising and needing medical attention. I am talking up to 30 times a day, regardless of how painful it would get. There was also no way of redirecting it, no matter how hard anyone tried, and I did it in public as well. 

Throughout my whole childhood UTIs were my best friend. I couldn´t go a month or two without having one. 

As young as 8 years old, I was teaching classmates how to masturbate, telling them if they rubbed themselves it would feel very nice, but not to tell because ""it´s my secret""

Ever since I moved to a different country with my parents I´ve been plagued by horrific nightmares where I am being either directly or indirectly sexually abused by the previously mentioned PE teacher, or the distant uncle.

Whenever I now masturbate, regardless if on my own or with my boyfriend, I then feel a wave of disgust towards myself, anxiety and I feel like crying. It is significantly worse if I am with my boyfriend, and when it happens I both want to be left alone but also crave physical contact such as hugging.

16355,1i0j5cf,post,what is dating like after? ,"I’m not thinking about going back to dating yet. I want to heal first and finish school, so maybe in two years... I’m not sure. I’ve always dreamed of getting married one day and having a couple of kids in a decade or so. But I can’t help but wonder... has there ever been a guy who fully accepted his girlfriend after she’s been SA’d?

Have you girls ever told your boyfriend about your SA experience? How did they receive the news, or did you decide not to tell them?  
For the guys... if your girlfriend ever told you about her SA experience, did it make you feel weird? Did you look at her any differently?

I remember reading a Reddit post a while ago where a guy said he wanted to break up with his girlfriend because he saw her as ""unclean"" after she was brutally SA’d. That post stuck with me, and I’ve been thinking about it ever since. My SA was oral, he forced me into f*ck-facing. And now I keep wondering, who would want to kiss me after that? Would they see me as dirty, a sl*t, or a wh\*re?

Even though it happened a while ago, would my future significant other be disgusted, thinking he could still ""taste"" that guy in my mouth? That thought terrifies me.

I can’t even look men in the eye anymore because I feel like they can see through me, like they somehow know what happened. The more I think about it, the more it settles in, and it makes me feel so terrible about myself. It’s like I can’t escape the shame, no matter how much I try to move forward.","what is dating like after?  I’m not thinking about going back to dating yet.

16360,m6yelgj,comment,,"First of all, I'm so sorry you had to go through that and I wish you peace and healing. Most of my experiences with sex have been terrible or straight up abuse (either a power imbalance or assault) and I'm currently in a relationship with a man so I can share a bit of my experience.

I completely understand the feeling of men ""seeing"" through you and somehow knowing the burden you carry. Before being with my actual partner, I tried with two different people. In both situations I told them about my trauma and they were very understanding and supportive, but as soon as we started being sexually active, it all went wrong. I suppose it's mostly my fault because I hadn't healed at all but I still can't help but think part of it was their fault for not respecting some boundary, as small as it was. In both cases I cried a lot immediately after sex and felt used.
If you haven't recovered, *fully processed* it yet or done any therapy I advise you to not become sexually active or involved in a relationship as it's likely it could hurt you and bring back some bad memories. Either that or take it slow, take your time for every single step. The right person will understand, really.

With my current boyfriend, I sometimes still struggle a lot. He's really understanding and he's never made me feel bad or ashamed because of what happened to me, but a long talk was needed because I felt like I had to make some rules clear. Before doing anything sexual, you should understand your boundaries. For me, I need my boyfriend to ask every few minutes if I'm okay or to make sure I like what's happening or what he's going to do, because I tend to freeze when something's wrong. Or let me initiate only, for example. He does that perfectly but there's still some issues that I carry, like feeling that there will always be a power imbalance when having sex with a man no matter the situation. But I'm learning to change that or use it for my benefit, maybe being more ""in charge"" or whatever feels best for me at the moment. My partner is okay with this of course.

Another thing I feel is that whenever I need more time, more space or anything, I'm doing something wrong because I ""owe"" him. How could someone love me for who I am, be patient, and not look down at me if I'm ""unclean"", right?? But it's all in my head, of course.

On the romantic or emotional side there haven't been any issues. There are some good and respectful men out there. If uneducated, they should still listen to you and comfort you.

It's a long journey and I still keep discovering triggers I didn't know I had. Therapy, if accesible, is needed. And of course a supportive partner. But most importantly keep in mind it's YOUR decision what to share, how much, when, and with who. Whoever you're with should respect that, and you should only open up when it feels right for *you*.

16368,1i0mtmh,post,My bestfriend raped me multiple times,"Hello. This is my first time posting so forgive me if this is not perfect. I had a male best friend for a year and we would party a lot. During some of this time, I was homeless and his family welcomed me to stay in their home. With the partying, I would get blackout drunk very often. When I would be blackout drunk, I would sleep over his house very often. It was usually just me and him throughout the entire summer. One day I woke up in different clothes, felt like i hadn’t slept but remembered nothing. I was in his clothes and he was sleeping on the same couch as me. This was in May and I didn’t think he would do that to me so I continued with our lifestyle. I had a conversation with him about not touching me when I am blacked out even if I ask to because I am not in the right state to consent. There were other instances and blackouts but when I finally discovered what he was doing to me I confronted him. I woke up with a sore nipple, marks all over my body, and I could feel that I was penetrated. My stomach dropped and I asked him if we did something the night before. He denied it but I kept pushing and he admitted to having sex with me while I was unconscious. I feel the drinking makes it difficult for me to remember how he treated me. I believe he is an abuser as there was one time I was blacked out and his mom had to intervene as he was yelling at me and apparently I told his mom that I was afraid he was going to hit me. My struggle here is that I know what he did yet I can’t seem to hate him and even would like to continue being friends. He made me feel understood, happy, and free and was my best friend yet every time we hang out I feel disgusted with myself. He also told me that each time it happened I asked to have sex and would always initiate it. I cant remember if that is true but it makes me feel like maybe I wasn’t taken advantage of purposely? I would like to know what to do, what happened to me, some validation maybe? I am struggling with the fact that my best friend raped me multiple times and I still cannot let go of him. Is this normal? What next steps do I take? 

edit: He showed me a new world and introduced me into a community where I feel understood and welcomed. The experiences we’ve had and way of living is not common. I feel like I will never be able to feel a connection like that again. I do have a history of abuse during childhood and I don’t know if that impacts my relationships. I fear he will do this to another girl but I don’t know if I can speak about this, especially because I continued being his friend afterwards.","My bestfriend raped me multiple times Hello.

My struggle here is that I know what he did yet I can’t seem to hate him and even would like to continue being friends. He made me feel understood, happy, and free and was my best friend yet every time we hang out I feel disgusted with myself. He also told me that each time it happened I asked to have sex and would always initiate it. I cant remember if that is true but it makes me feel like maybe I wasn’t taken advantage of purposely? I would like to know what to do, what happened to me, some validation maybe? I am struggling with the fact that my best friend raped me multiple times and I still cannot let go of him. Is this normal? What next steps do I take? 

edit: He showed me a new world and introduced me into a community where I feel understood and welcomed. The experiences we’ve had and way of living is not common. I feel like I will never be able to feel a connection like that again. I do have a history of abuse during childhood and I don’t know if that impacts my relationships. I fear he will do this to another girl but I don’t know if I can speak about this, especially because I continued being his friend afterwards.",34,12.0,2025-01-13 19:51,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1i0mtmh/my_bestfriend_raped_me_multiple_times/,Neutral

16409,1i0rxgg,post,Please Help,"From about when I (male) was 5-14 I was sexually abused/ touched by my cousin who is 3 years older. I didnt realize the level of effect the abuse had on me, but it didn’t start or stop on the sexual level. I was the scapegoat, anything he did wrong was something “I did wrong”. I was always told by this cousin that “we can’t tell anyone” and it encouraged me to lie to my family from a young age.

I’m not going to blame the guy for my own actions and my own lies. I chose to adopt an early mindset of me vs everyone + your family fucks you, and I used that hatred to achieve ridiculous amounts of success at a very young age. I had to take a very long, very hard look in the mirror at 20, and realize that I had to break my cycle of hatred.

Before I proceed let me preface. Our families are super close (dads share everything including bank accounts) and we come from a family/friend circle that spans over 500 people. We were raised as brothers, not necessarily by choice — in a way I felt very Stockholmed and confused.

2 years ago I decided to talk to him and give him a chance to come clean, when he didn’t take it, I told my nuclear family. Naturally they thought I was delusional, and he went on a shit storm to paint me as someone who was “too smart to be human” and “out of touch”. He makes mocking faces at me when nobody’s looking, and he has begun to talk shit to our extended family (who are uninformed of the situation)

I love my OTHER family members, and dont want to lose them but can’t really say anything without sounding crazy. I can’t lean in and spend more time because hes always there, and I struggle to hang out with my parents because they make me feel like I’ve lost my marbles. I’m forced to play friendly, and accept i wont get justice. I’m losing my confidence, battling my pride, and losing myself.

Do I:

A.) Paint the town red and cut off all contact

B.) Highroad (I’m trying, somewhat failing)and stay the course hoping he unravels 

C.) Start over and never look back
 ","Please Help From about when I (male) was 5-14 I was sexually abused/ touched by my cousin who is 3 years older. I didnt realize the level of effect the abuse had on me, but it didn’t start or stop on the sexual level. I was the scapegoat, anything he did wrong was something “I did wrong”. I was always told by this cousin that “we can’t tell anyone” and it encouraged me to lie to my family from a young age.

I’m not going to blame the guy for my own actions and my own lies. I chose to adopt an early mindset of me vs everyone + your family fucks you, and I used that hatred to achieve ridiculous amounts of success at a very young age. I had to take a very long, very hard look in the mirror at 20, and realize that I had to break my cycle of hatred.

16412,1i0s32v,post,Childhood trauma?,"Firstly , if this isn’t a good post to put here I am so so so sorry. I know for a certain I was abused as a child. But I feel like my trauma wasn’t sa. But it was inappropriate and it made me feel violated. Idk. I just want whoever reads this to know I am not trying to infiltrate this community and if this isn’t a good post I’m genuinely sorry. 

When I was a child for some reason I always felt so uncomfortable with getting kisses specifically on the lips. My mom always told me (i was probably 12 or so? Maybe even younger?) that I was such a creep for thinking kisses were weird. And she would force me to kiss her on the lips. I always told her I would rather on the cheek and that I just felt uncomfortable and I didn’t know why. But she would tell me I was that I was misrepresenting things and that it was so unloving to her. And yes she genuinely would proceed to force me to kiss her on her lips.

There was another time where she pinned me down and “cuddled” with me. I sobbed in her arms. She had to forcibly hold me because we had had an argument and I didn’t want to cuddle with her. 

She never let me sleep in the same bed with other girls because we were “gay” and definitely doing something with each other. 

One time when I was 12 she physically dressed me (ex. She put tights on me and then my skirt) 

I remember random times her seeing me in the shower and disregarding how upset I was by her seeing me naked. 

So idk. I felt very violated in those moments but I don’t feel like it was enough ti warrant the “sa” title

My life was already over once they decided to do that to me but I feel like this is my chance to get it back. But will I be simultaneously ruining it? I am not familiar with what will happen and I only ever hear of regrets and I honestly fear they will frame me as a liar somehow. I don't even want to punish them or ruin their lives if I could even tell whoever in the legal system responsible to have mercy i would but I just can't not say anything anymore if there is someone else hurt out there.

16460,1i0vonc,post,Neglecting yourself,"TW: dental care/teeth 

It's now been about 2 1/2 years since ending my bad relationship. A few months from university procedings centering said relationship. 

I have a new apartment hundreds of miles away, slowly chipping away at classes I had failed because of my ex/the abuse, and I most of all, have finally been taking care of myself again. 

I clean my sheets every week, dishes are done every night, I clean my apartment throughout the week, shower daily, wash my face every day, take my meds every day, go to therapy regularly, and more. 

What sucks is the way I am still feeling the effects of the relationship I was in, specifically, the neglect of my health, especially my dental health. 

I have had 4 teeth rot away/break beggining while in the relationship, but increased now. While I do have mental health issues, the relationship was miserable and I threw my health and wellbeing out the window. No, my mom's dental insurance won't help, no, credit isn't an option, I have been denied repeatedly because of college debt, and I just feel hopeless. I have since then been regularly brushing and swishing when I remember to, I'll admit there are periods where I forget to because of business and mental health. 

It just makes me feel a lot of frustration and anger for the situatuion all over again because had I not been in that space/relationship, maybe my teeth wouldn't be so bad. I haven't brought this up in therapy yet and I plan to asap. 

But does anyone feel the same? Pleae tell me I'm not alone, I feel so mortified and embarassed. While you absolutely cannot see the gaps unless you look very very closely, I cannot stop thinking about how disgusted I feel.

for context, i met a guy on an app and we went on a few dates. i really liked him very quickly and i saw a future for us (in hindsight, he was lovebombing me) then after one of our dates, we laid in his bed, i told him i didn’t want to have sex, he said okay but it happened anyways despite me telling him to stop multiple times. this happened in november. i ghosted him the next day and had been reeling over the situation as this was also my first sexual experience ever. i thought/think about it 24/7 and it consumes me. 
a few weeks ago, i started to really miss him? i started telling myself the experience was “more complicated and nuanced” and maybe i was overreacting because it was my first time and i had intense guilt. i think i was so tired of feeling so hurt and disgusted that my brain just did a complete 180. i wanted him back. i drank too much on tuesday night and called him twice, but hung up before he could pick up. he texted me the next day and i answered. we started talking again. on saturday he said he wanted to see me and i told him to come over. it was fully my intention to have sex with him and so we did. i felt actually crazy. i knew everything i was doing was the worst thing i could be doing but it felt like i needed to do it. i just wanted so badly to pretend that the first experience never happened and that everything was normal. i wanted to pretend that it was an accident on his part and that maybe we had something good and real. obviously, that will just never be the case. 
i was never a perfect victim in the first place and now i feel even worse. he also did something weird the second time around; i gave him a condom, i thought he put it on but it turns out he didn’t at first. he was inside of me for a bit, pulled out, and then put it on. it feels weird that he didn’t ask if i was okay with that and i feel very paranoid now. 
i feel so stupid. this is all so unlike me and i just feel like i’m drowning. i’ve blocked his number and i genuinely don’t want to see him anymore which feels like a good step in the right direction, but i worry that my contempt for him will fade again. i wish he didn’t have such a grip on me. i literally felt like i was possessed when i contacted him again, but i know i have to take accountability for my actions. this is all just so confusing and frustrating and now i’m the only one to blame. this may sound silly, but i recently watched the nosferatu movie and it just felt exactly like what this has felt like. i wanted someone to love me and they came to me but took advantage of me and then maintained such a grip on me until i felt forced to give in again. it just all feels so sick and twisted. idk sorry this is such a long read.

i feel so stupid. this is all so unlike me and i just feel like i’m drowning. i’ve blocked his number and i genuinely don’t want to see him anymore which feels like a good step in the right direction, but i worry that my contempt for him will fade again. i wish he didn’t have such a grip on me. i literally felt like i was possessed when i contacted him again, but i know i have to take accountability for my actions. this is all just so confusing and frustrating and now i’m the only one to blame. this may sound silly, but i recently watched the nosferatu movie and it just felt exactly like what this has felt like. i wanted someone to love me and they came to me but took advantage of me and then maintained such a grip on me until i felt forced to give in again. it just all feels so sick and twisted. idk sorry this is such a long read.

I think your best option will be to talk about it with an experienced therapist who will respect your boundaries and help you to process these feelings and memories at your own pace. When you're ready to interview a new therapist, you could even print out what you wrote here and show it to them when they ask what brings you to their office.

Memory is weird, and it's completely normal for people to dissociate during traumatic events and not have any narrative memory of what happened. Dr. Jim Hopper has an [excellent overview](https://jimhopper.com/topics/child-abuse/recovered-memories-of-sexual-abuse/scientific-research/) of the science behind this lack of memory and how difficult it can be when people start to recover those memories. It doesn't sound like anything is ""wrong"" with you, but you're struggling with symptoms of profound trauma that you are struggling to process on your own. How did it feel to share all of that? Was writing it here your first time putting all of that into words?

You're more than welcome to talk about it here, and the community will help you to understand the context of what you're feeling and remind you that nothing about it is your fault. No matter how sexual you were as a child or how much trouble you are having remembering the specifics, you can trust your gut that adults in your life failed to protect you from something horrible and the feelings you're having now are how your nervous system is trying to process that trauma.

If it's an option for you, a professional therapist who you can build a relationship with really is the best way to get help for what you're struggling with. I know it can be hard to trust a therapist after the last one pushed you too hard and gave you a panic attack, but *most* therapists who are forewarned will be sensitive to your trauma and not push you to talk about things until you are ready.

If you want to try talking about it here, take it slowly! The dissociation and panic attacks are ways that your brain has protected you from some really difficult memories that you weren't ready to confront yet. Those symptoms don't mean that anything is ""wrong"" with you, but they do imply that you need to build grounding skills and alternative coping mechanisms to help you through difficult times when you're on the edge of recalling a very traumatic memory. When you were working with a therapist, have you had a chance to practice grounding techniques and figure out which ones are effective for you?"," > The only time I talked to a therapist about it, she kept asking me to give her details.

> thankfully am not traumatized , but I feel horrible for just enjoying such events

I guess my main question is: what is the difference between feeling 'terrible' and feeling 'traumatized'? How would feeling traumatized be different from what you are feeling now? Why do you feel like something is wrong with you because you enjoyed being touched by your neighbor or your other friends?

> when I remember them I feel soo Wierd because that isn't me in this picture stuck in my mind

Can you say more about how these memories feel? Are they detached from how you usually think about things, like pictures in your head rather than full sensory memories?

This is a very passive and somewhat concerning way of describing masturbating together with a friend.

16476,1i0xe8l,post,Is this… rape?,"This happened just over a week ago now and honestly last week I was pretty shaken up by it but now it’s a lil numb. 

Anyway long story short, a few of my coworkers (3 guys) and I (girl) went drinking one night and went back to one of their houses. We sat and chatted for a bit and they noticed I was tired so they said I should go and lay down for a bit. I was a bit hesitant but eventually went to lay down for a bit.

Within the next hour or two, 2 of the guys left - leaving me alone with one guy. He asked if he could lay down in bed with me and my half asleep and half drunk ass agreed. He asked to cuddle me and I agreed. Then he started to grope me and asked to kiss me. I believe I just mumbled something that wasn’t a yes or no and he kinda just went for it (for context he’s kissed me twice in the past before when I was drunk and didn’t give him explicit consent, and he knows I freeze and struggle to say no). He then took off my panties and after a while got up and asked if I wanted it. I mumbled again, half asleep and half scared, not believing what was happening. He took that as a yes and well… you can guess what happened next really. He did it twice. 

I just don’t really know what happened I guess. It was my fault for knowingly resting in his bed after previous incidents with him and I could’ve and should’ve said no but I didn’t. I just feel guilty and gross for letting him do that to me ugh I don’t know why I’m like this.

16484,1i0yec8,post,"Molested as a child, it lingers and and it’s damaging my mental health","SA involving a minor.

I had a rough childhood, being between my mom and dad- as they had to share custody of me. My mom’s house was a safe haven for me, I felt so loved there. My dad’s house, however, was unpredictable, and I walked on constant egg shells. My dad had severe anger issues, and would often take things out on me. But this instance isn’t about him, it’s about his wife. Will call her ‘wife’ from here on. 

Wife had a son when I was 7, in 2012. I’m 20 (female btw) now. So this was a very long time ago. I was so innocent. When she was alone, feeding him, she would call me in to see and watch. And would tell me to touch her chest, “because there was a cut on it”. It felt so wrong as a kid and it made me feel so dirty. I’d never seen THAT in my life at that point in time. 

I began to obsess. I would draw people with bigger chests. I would draw what I saw. I would think about it. I was still such a little girl and it was all I could think about. I remember as a kid, that the wife’s only personality trait was her chest. She would walk around topless at night, or just brag about breastfeeding until my half sibling was  2-3. My mom’s side of the family was so concerned of the explicit nature of this, and told a family member on my dad’s side to tell her to stop. She would make me cringe as a child and I hated her. 


Another thing I’d like to mention, is that I witnessed indefinitely on my dads end a lot as a kid, how he would look at other women while married, and later on, how I found out he cheated with my mom when I was still a baby. It was crazy to me.

I’m the kind of person to never look back on the past and let it ruin me. There’s a lot I can turn my cheek to.. so many undoubtedly worse things. But for some reason, this one thing, involving the wife, actually complicated both my sexuality and anxiety surrounding sexual topics a lot. 

I’m very grateful for my boyfriend, who I’ve been dating for 3 years now, we have a very healthy sex life. I have genuine panic attacks at the thought of seeing a naked (topless) women in film! And it’s very prominent in film these days… I get anxiety when I see naked women in films that I watch alone, and I get full blown anxiety  attacks when I know that he’s watching a show on his own time that has a lot of naked women in it, like, idk, Narcos. It’s so bad, I suffer every single day. I can’t even see it in forms of art if it’s too explicit, in movies, in tv shows. Because I have such complicated feelings towards it- without getting too into it, I thought I liked a woman’s body more than I did a man- for a while. If I did feel things, sexually, it would only be towards the body of a woman, but I also feared it. Seeing a conventionally attractive nude, sexualized woman in a movie would, ugh, make me feel excited, but also so scared and nervous. But in recent years, just sick and scared. I am not gay, or bi, I am 100% straight, always have been. Since I’ve gotten in a relationship, I fear literal topless women! I hate to say it. It sounds pathetic but I think it’s a trauma response. I can’t have an anxiety attack every time I see a boob. It’s nonsense. It’s odd because I don’t react this way when I see anything else on a woman. 

I need therapy- just so badly. Looking in my area but I’m kind of a broke student rn 😀 I’m so tired of this anxiety ruling my life!","Molested as a child, it lingers and and it’s damaging my mental health SA involving a minor.

I can’t have an anxiety attack every time I see a boob. It’s nonsense. It’s odd because I don’t react this way when I see anything else on a woman. 

I need therapy- just so badly. Looking in my area but I’m kind of a broke student rn 😀 I’m so tired of this anxiety ruling my life!",2,1.0,2025-01-14 4:49,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1i0yec8/molested_as_a_child_it_lingers_and_and_its/,Neutral

16494,1i0z7z0,post,Unknowingly seem to have lost my virginity ,"My ex would constantly ask to have sex with me but I didn't want to. I told him I didnt want to until I was certain of a future with him. And I also wanted my first time to be special. And I wanted to wait a minimum of 6 months.

After like 2 months into the relationship he guilted me for not ""putting out"" and was still always asking for sex (anal and vaginal specifically). 

One day he was like ""can I please put it iN"" and I was again like ""no""... then he begs and says ""just the tip"" and I say ""fine... JUST THE TIP"" to shut him up. Idk why that didnt register as me signing up to lose my virginity. I just though like 1 inch wouldnt be the real deal or count. And this is after he asked and begged after I said no repeatedly though.

I was very uncomfortable the whole time. He even said while he was ""doing it"" that it ""looks like I dont wanna be here"" or something like that.

 It happened a second time and after that I really put my foot down and was turned off from it completely.... cuz every time I just felt pressured. And it didnt really feel like anything on my end, either. 

Then one time, I didnt even give a reluctant ""fine"" or anything,, he just slipped it in on purpose... first he used his fingers on me and i was like ""AH, is that your pp??"" And he was like ""what! No!"" But a minute later it WAS!! 😭 and he pretends to play dumb like ""i didnt know u didnt want that"" after I had specifically re-stated my whole ""I DONT WANNA DO VAGINA STUFF"" w him.

I just feel sick and depressed over all this. I even told him before any of this stuff happened that I like being a virgin. Like implying that I wanted to stay one. ...Anything I agreed to it was only after I had already said no and said im not comfortable, but he broke me in and I gave up trying to deny him. And i really didnt think just the tip meant anything but ig I was wrong.

Just sucks I was coerced and guilted into what feels like losing my virginity when I felt super uncomfortable the whole time and it also felt like absolutely nothing on my end cuz it was less than an inch

I can't stop thinking about this and it upsets me to no end because he probably just wanted to take my virginity for bragging rights or to add me to a number or something. But it was supposed to be something special for me and ended up happening just to appease him after he wouldn't take no for an answer over and over... im so upset 😞

Just curious peoples opinions on this. I still feel like a virgin cuz it didnt feel like anything and I didn't even want to do, and id never ask HIM for anything, but idk anymore. I mainly just feel sick to my stomach about the whole thing and wanna disappear

It doesn't matter if it was just the ""Tip"" no means no, you already seem to be aware he guilted you into it too, and it almost seems like sex is more important to him then love, and also your well being or opinion. If i'm being honest, if he can't wait for you, he isn't worth your virginity, or to be your boyfriend at all. 
And yes,  this IS sexual assault even if he ""Asked"" before, he didn't listen so kept begging. And in the end even went furder.
I don't wanna come off rude, but you really can get beter.


As for the still being virgin, well for my personal opinion.. yes you are still virgin because the fact he didn't go all the way in means your hymen isn't touched in any way and you didn't ""feel anything"" and the ""first time"" can always hurt a little bit if that happens. Still, that doesn't justify his actions, and yes it is still considered rape/sexual assault.




I'm a adult now but as a child/teen a long time ago i also had a boyfriend (even 2) who tried guilting me into sexual stuff, not by ""Putting it in"" but more touching me on places i did not want and him wanting me to touch him in ways i did not want yet and i admit i might have fallen for some of it because my ex boyfriend told me ""If i really loved him and wanted to make me happy"" i would do it. And ""If i didn't he would obviously find someone wou wanted it."" Or that he would ""Dump me"" even. Luckily i did not go all the way with him and i'm glad i didn't because even after the things i DID give he still cheated. And i walked around regretting it all. i sometimes still tell my teen me: ""You should have dumped him wayy earlier then you did."" And for refferences.. i'm 31 now and was around 14 when this happend.

16516,1i106za,post,I don’t know,"flair could be a hundred things I can’t think very hard about it. thought this was the most vague.

sorry if this isn’t fit for this subreddit, needed to get it out.

the story:
i(21, ftm) recently opened my relationship with my boyfriend(22, ftm) and decided to hook up with a man on grindr. it was my first time touching a penis. the first time went fine, though in text and once or twice in person he complained about having to wear a condom. i have an extreme fear of pregancy.

then i saw him again, after trying birth control and finding it wasn’t for me. i brought condoms this time, as he told me he had none left. we had sex, consensually. when i went to the bathroom after, out came a piece of condom. i noted the boxes of condoms under the sink. nervous to tell this man i barely know, and maybe a bit naive, i decided to wait until i got home to text him to tell him. i told him i was taking a plan b, and asked him to help pay. 

i thought about it for a few days, and decided to break it off with him, saying i saw that he lied about not having condoms, and it makes me uncomfortable that he keeps pressuring me to go unprotected. 

this is the rough part. he does not take this well at all.

he calls me delusional, implying i might be lying about the condom breaking (for money, i guess?) and implies its my fault for getting “shitty condoms”.
he tells me i have a “sad view of the world” and condescendingly tells me to “get better”. i shake as i type back to him.

since this event about a month ago, i have had extreme troubles with flashbacks and dark thoughts. i’ve struggled to have sex with my boyfriend, stopping partway several times. i’ve thought about self harm, and my ocd has gotten much worse. i don’t know what to do. i feel ridiculous, like he was right that i’m delusional. i had consensual sex that happened to go wrong. it makes me fear sex. i don’t know why i’m posting this.

thank you for reading.","I don’t know flair could be a hundred things I can’t think very hard about it. thought this was the most vague.

16519,1i109ut,post,Is this Sexual Assault or Am I Overreacting?,"(i apologize this may be a long post but pls read) 
Today the man that did this to me tried to friend me on facebook and i was brought back to this conflicting place in my mind of whether or not what i experienced was s/a. I’ve been battling with was it or was it not for a few years and I think its time I get to the bottom. 

When I was 14 in grade 9 I became friends with this group of 11th/12th graders and one night we decided to hangout at the park and skateboard. it was beginning to get late and everyone started to head home. One of the guys insisted he walk me home to make sure i get home safe. On the walk home there was a trail that branched off of the street where we would part ways, the trail was off the side of a rec center and a small forest. he said that we should walk down this trail because its equally halfway between my house and his. I said okay not thinking much of it. While walking down the trail he started sort of putting his arm around me and i tried to awkwardly laugh and just hint that hey im not into you we are just friends. He started getting a bit more determined and he picked me up and was carrying me somewhere. i tried to get out and actually peed myself a little while trying. I tried to de escalate the situation by saying i need to get home its late and cold but he kept trying. he took my backpack off and put me down on the grass and got on top of me. he began grabbing me on my breasts and trying to get under my clothing (thankfully my clothes were too loose so i had tied my pants, shirt, and bra with rubber bands tightly so he couldnt get under. he was rough and what he was doing hurt. i had never kissed or hugged a guy at this point and i wasn’t into him. he kept getting closer to my face trying to pressure me into kidding him saying “just a peck”. i said no and he kept trying. after maybe 7 mins of this my phone began ringing and i saw it was my mom. i always answer my moms calls so i was worried she was gonna be worried about me. she kept calling and after 5-10 calls missed she got in her car and somehow knew it was was near the rec centre. i saw her car and said “thats my mom i gtg”. he got off and i grabbed my bag and went into the car. my mom offered to guve my “friend” a drive home and i said no i just wanna go home. I got home and immediately took a bath to try and comprehend what just happened and comfort myself. when i got out i texted him saying i think he sexually assaulted me and it wasnt okay. he kept apologizing and saying can we keep it between us. i assumed it was a genuine mistake and eventually i ended up hanging out with him again. he tried the same thing, convincing me and physically grabbing my my hand and placing them on his privates. that night i went home and decided i rly dont wanna see him again. i later found out he had done this to 2-3 more girls and one tried to pressure charges. I saw him at a walmart parking lot a few months ago and a wave of heat and cold and panic rushed over me when my current boyfriend said something along the lines of “look at that guy” so i looked and immediately said i need to go home now. 

SO my question is: Was this considered sexual assault even though i voluntarily hung out with him again? Am i overreacting or delusional?","Is this Sexual Assault or Am I Overreacting? (i apologize this may be a long post but pls read)

I did leave out some things because for some reason bits and pieces disappear from my memory at times, but I also exhibited other behaviors such as enacting sexual acts with my toys, some of which a child should not and could not know (for example oral sex)

I tried telling my boyfriend about it, but I froze and started laughing nervously, so he just read the post instead. But when he asked more questions I just couldn´t answer them. I couldn´t pinpoint a specific trigger. He wants to help but I don´t know how to give him clear information if I don´t have it myself.

He did offer to postpone any kind of intimacy and only do it on my terms for as long as I would like, but that didn´t really change my mental state. 

I did work on grounding skills before, but whenever I feel this disconnected, if I try and ground myself I feel even worse because then I notice my body and that makes it worse. Whenever I am doing an activity that requires me to be aware of my body´s existence I get anxious and dizzy.

My mother confirmed the grooming, I have memories of the grooming, and I have symptoms of more serious stuff happening, yet I cannot remember it, no matter how hard I try, all I get is the dark locker room and a feeling of unease.

16544,1i1413q,post,My window is doomed .. false alarm TRIGGER: assult,"So I heard a woman scream bloody murder and what sounded like assault for 30-45 minutes in my last post - this ended up being a faze alarm …

Tonight (same ish time) a I heard what sounded like a woman well sounds like two woman repeatedly saying “help hello” 
So after 15 minutes I go try to see where it’s coming from … no avail I come back and I move shit from
The window & it sounds still like someone is yelling (over sm hour still going) but it’s more clear now 45 minutes of what sounds like an Asian grandmother sumo wrestler? No slur intended. 
 “heyooooo” like lifting something heavy or in a nightmare at psychiatric ward … 

Still just in case (like a dummy)… I tried echoing back .. & determined it’s not like “immediate danger I need help” wailing as much as it sounds like someone under care and not mentally all there .. 
it’s very loud and I’m sure others can hear that are in that building .. I’ve never heard it before …  but at first I almost wanted it to be the woman because i want to know she’s alive and not trapped still or dead … 

I just can’t stop thinking of what happened when she went silent slowly giving up …  i couldn’t imagine it was on the street or the abandoned building next the a fire dept. and school … it was from the apartments as I could hear her murmurs just as loud as her scream.. as if she was in the apartment above mine and her voice coming from the vent … 
& that means 
It must’ve been someone thinking they were around safe company or a very silent break in but the community talks ….  Idk why but I imagine a girl yelling in a park full of people during daylight and no one hearing her.  The bystanders effect is fake it’s made up & just like the woman on the train platform was set on fire & no one helped her … it baffles me there’s not more protocol ir self defense taught in schools & the bystander effect just gives an excuse now … Sorry for posting here I realized there was another trigger in my room I over looked and I haven’t felt the same comfort or safe in my own room anymore after everything I’ve witnessed/remmeberrd/gone through the past few weeks 

Is there was an app for sexual assault/violence so people could easily report drop pins & be updated as I found in nyc to access public records like sex offenders you have to request and pay up to a $100 for specific records ….. every other state criminal activity was easy to access and free or a very small $5 max charge.

16550,1i15ljn,post,Was this sexual assault? Or am I mistaken? ,"This is a question that has kept me up for the past 4 years. Sometimes I think yes, I was assaulted, and other times I think I'm an imposter, that I'm lying about being assaulted. So please tell me, what you guys think. 

It all started when I met, we'll call him... Harry. I met Harry, on a dating app, and immediately I was attracted to him because he was in the same school as me. I had graduated the year earlier, and he was graduating that year. I was 20, and he was 18. Turning 19 in 7 days at that point. So I didn't think the age difference was terrible between us. 

We got chatting, and I was so attracted to him. He was very popular, extremely smart and was even going to an ivy league for his Bachelors, on a fully paid scholarship. 

At first, it started off casual. Then when I expressed my feats, he hinted that even when he left things wouldn't be over. 

Then suddenly... this happened. 

That day I had gone to meet him with a funny feeling in my chest. Something wasn't sitting right with me. 

I got there and he was acting weird, twitchy and nervous. I said let's go to your terrace, so we can make out, and tried to kiss him a few times. But the entire time, it felt weird. He was too stiff and almost was Pity kissing me. 

The thing is, I refused to sleep with him. I didn't even let him finger me, but I gave him a hand job. He was my first ever boyfriend, I hadn't even had my first kiss. So yeah... that. 

Anyway, on the way there, I had texted him about how I didn't want to have oral sex, as he pushed me about it over text (again). 

So we go to the terrace and we're making out. I remember sitting on a step, and he whips out his thing, so it's right in front of my face. And I smiled at him nervously and I remember my heart racing because I didn't like where this was going, and he just kept coming closer and put his thing on my lops and I jist allowed him to do that. 

Then he held my hair so tight there were teats in my eyes and while he was doing that more intensely, I honestly felt like I was choking. So when I finally had some space to breathe, I said can we stop and he pulled his thing out and said of course.

You’re not dirty he GROOMED YOU. No grownass adult is gonna let a situation like this play out period. I’m 25 and I wouldn’t even date a 20 year old. As much as you might think you initiated things, this would never have happened if he didn’t groom you. 

Also your sexual status does not make you dirty. And in this case you are a victim. Please please please get your parents involved and do NOT talk to him you don’t owe him the time of day.

You cannot have a healthy relationship with this person. He will use the power dynamic from him being 20 years older than you, and you being a KID to manipulate you, belittle you, etc. Sure it might be all good now while he was trying to get you to trust him enough to give him what he wants, but from here it’s all downhill, trust me. I dated someone that was 23 when I was 18 and even though we were both legal adults, she still used my age against me all the time to make me feel dumb because I was young. 

Message me if you need moral support, this is really hard, but this man is not a safe person. Anyone who wants to fuck kids is a twisted predator. It might not feel like it right now, but when you grow up you’ll understand. 

He’s probably said things like “you’re so mature for your age”. You might in fact be mature for your age! Listen, I have NEVER, NOT ONCE, been attracted to a CHILD, regardless of their maturity level. He is using that to make you feel special. Attention from adults is going to feel special when you’re your age, but I promise you, this is not it girl. 

I’m proud of you for asking for help online, but you need need need to talk to a parent, counselor, teacher, etc. so they can help you go to the police.

Good luck, let me know if you need moral support once again. You’re not alone here."," UUUUUUHHHHHHHHH PLS TALK TO YOUR PARENTS AND FILE A POLICE REPORT

He had no name and goes by maun baba(he took a pledge not to speak nor to sit). As typical Indian my parents started asking him questions abt misery nd as a token of respect ask me and my cousin to sit beside him nd we were asked to give foot massage to him nd we were happy to do so.

We made eye contact and left at once. 
             I couldn’t tell my parents this act of his nd my humble sweet parents offered him a room to stay all night. He asked for me and my cousin to sleep with him. I said no.

16589,1i1ethe,post,I have a hard time fully believing her ,"there's a girl I know who's ex is a piece of crap. I know that. another girl accused him of sexual assault but then also was lying about her age and coming onto him so that was a messy, confusing situation. but then this girl I know has accused her ex of sexual assault as well but there's some details that make it strange.

first of all, she was mean to me and spread rumors about me before, after, and during her relationship with that guy. she's said things about me that are blatant lies. because of that, I can't really trust everything she says and even if I want to, I know she has a history of lying about people she doesn't like to make them look bad. 

secondly, she only said he was sexually abusive immediately after it was revealed my ex was sexually abusive towards me. she would constantly talk about her ex being a jerk and watching porn and cheating and she didn't spare details about it, so it just felt odd that she never even hinted towards him being sexually abusive until my abuse came to light.

thirdly, she's never given any details of being sexually assaulted other than saying he was always coming onto her. she talks about doing things with him consensually and hasn't even shared a story about anything being really forced or coerced.

and just lastly, she's still totally obsessed with him which I find really odd to do with a guy who you're saying raped you. my rapist is blocked and every imaginable app and when I hear he's at the same place as me I have a panic attack. she purposely tries to get close to him and get his attention. it just geels so weird.

I feel so guilty for not fully believing her because I want to believe all victims but it's so hard to with all this stuff and I'm just not sure what to do. I want to believe her and I know people cope differently but it just feels off. ","I have a hard time fully believing her  there's a girl I know who's ex is a piece of crap.

She also tried to gaslight and manipulate me into not writing it, saying things like, ""the world has taken strides against SA""/""It's considered poor taste to include SA in a book""/etc. Her arguments were also unfounded bc, from what I see, the SA issue has only gotten worse in recent years. And the only time it's ""poor taste"" in a book is if it's romanticized or made to be ""hot"" or whatever shit like that. Which is something I definitely don't do in my book.

Why is this bad? Well, there was zero to do with healing from SA and it was completely glossed over. It was mere shock value. Also, it felt very much like pot calls kettle black bc...how can she write about SA and not me? Makes no sense.

Amidst all of that, she talked about me and personal things behind my back, which is...shitty and shady.

16610,1i1hb7m,post,He wrote a song about wanting to rape me,"This is about an ex who I've been no contact with for a year and 1/2.

Back in the day we went no contact for two months until I caved and missed him and went crawling back. During this time he explained to me he wrote a song about me, 'taking charge and being dominant sexually' He then followed it up with ""Not that I would like...do anything"" implying he wouldn't SA me. He sexually assaulted me three times that month following that conversation.

Back in the day we went no contact for two months until I caved and missed him and went crawling back. During this time he explained to me he wrote a song about me, 'taking charge and being dominant sexually' He then followed it up with ""Not that I would like...do anything"" implying he wouldn't SA me. He sexually assaulted me three times that month following that conversation.

16615,m767hxx,comment,,"A type of therapy called Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, or CBT might be helpful for you. It can help you to understand the chain of thoughts that go from you remembering these events to feeling terrible about it, and challenge the automatic thoughts and judgements that lead to you feeling bad about it. Is it possible for you to talk to a therapist?

Here are some thoughts and questions I had while reading your answers:

People can carry around a lot of guilt about ""should"". Whether it comes from their culture, their religion, their parents, or some other moral value they've internalized. It sounds like the idea that children ""shouldn't"" do sexual things is causing you a lot of stress. Whether it was your neighbor or the other friend, at least one person in your social circle was groomed by an adult and introduced to sexual activity before they really understood it. Do you feel like children who act out sexual behaviors are ""bad"" or damaged or otherwise immoral? Or are they just innocent children doing something that they think feels good with friends?

The term ""child-on-child sexual assault"" (or COCSA) can cover situations like this where children practice the behavior they have been taught with others in their social group, and it can leave people with a lot of unresolved feelings. When you write that it's not how a child 'should' act, is there an element of moral judgement there? 

Sexual pleasure is a *very* powerful feeling, and it's normal for children to want to feel good and make their friends feel good too. Was there a sense of it being a secret that you all shared? Something that you had to keep secret from parents or other adults or you'd get in trouble? Even if there is no violence or coercion in childhood sexual abuse, a lot of people end up feeling like they did something bad or shameful just because they had to keep it a secret or they got in trouble when an adult found out a little bit of what was happening so they made sure to get even better at hiding the behavior (and felt even more ashamed of it). Was there an element of that for you?

For the stuff that started a few months ago with your friend, I don't think there's anything bad or gross about doing that together. But I don't think it's healthy to think about it as him 'using you for his pleasure'. If you would rather spend time with your friend without the sexual stuff it's okay to set that boundary and tell him that you don't want to do that any more and would rather just play games. But if you like it and want to keep doing that with him, then it's nothing to feel bad about or be ashamed of. Some friends like to do sexual stuff together as just something fun to do together, while other people want to have a closer relationship and be ""boyfriends"". And other friends don't do anything sexual at all. You can have whatever kind of friendship you want with him, but it's important that you be honest with yourself about what you want."," A type of therapy called Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, or CBT might be helpful for you.

It's difficult to talk about. I haven't spoken to anyone about what has happened to me from my family for \~6 months after it happened (I told my psychiatrist before).

Don’t feel like you can’t be supported or aren’t worthy of it . I also feared if I was imagining it and such and after a while i started to process more and realized I know what happened and no one can tell me otherwise i remember the words and everything very detailed.

It’s very normal for it to come back later.

16650,1i1n13y,post,Sex repulsed but hypersexual ,"I’ve (17F) been raped and sexually assaulted on multiple occasions since I was 8. And was taught how to masturbate and shown porn when I was 8 by rapist. So I would masturbate without fully understanding what it was when I was younger and would innaproprately touch people when I was 8 because I thought it was normal. Until my mother told me I can’t do that and it was wrong. Then I stopped and felt guilty and wouldn’t masturbate anymore but I kept getting raped. And when I was 12 I got sexually assaulted again by someone else and by then I understood what it was and I was retraumatised about what happened by when I was 8. And I started to become hypersexual.

I would masturbate and watch porn multiple times a day. Until 14 I was raped again and I could no longer watch porn it grossed me out sometimes I try it again but immediately get disgusted . I still was and am hypersexual but at the same time feel so disgusted at any time I’d do anything sexual whether it was with someone else or on my own. I’ve sometimes thrown up I’ve felt so gross. It’s at the point now if I am going to have sex with someone I am into it before hand but when we actually start I get disgusted I and afterwards I just feel worthless. And suicidal. 

I feel so upset because I want a normal life I wish I could have a boyfriend but I’m too mentally messed up for anyone who’s not a creep to love me. I want the teenage stereotype relationship I don’t care if it isn’t perfect I just wish I was a virgin and had a boyfriend and we have sex and it’s awkward and cringey and like the movies. All my friends lose their virginity and tell me about it and I’m happy for them and stuff but I feel somewhat jealous that they got to have that by choice and it be new and it not be something that was already like “be there done that” that’s how I felt at I wasn’t even a teenager yet. It’s just messed up. I want everything to be normal. I want to have a teenage sweetheart. Instead everyone thinks im just a used up slut. And I feel that way too.

i need to get this out before my lid blows off. i can't even believe this needs explaining to people; surely this should be common sense among adults...

not. every. SA. case. is. the. same.

sometimes, victims are physically restrained and it's very gritty. this is what most people assume all SA cases are like.

sometimes, victims are coerced into doing it, so there's no kicking and screaming, but the 'consent' given was purely on the back of their coercion, which isn't consent.

sometimes, victims are psychologically manipulated into doing it with the use of scare tactics, threats, etc. this is not consent.

sometimes, victims are groomed into doing it. this is not consent.

sometimes, victims aren't conscious. this is not consent.

sometimes, victims are under pressure due to a power dynamic that puts them in a state of fear for their wellbeing, so they 'consent' in hope of sparing their life. this is not consent.

sometimes, victims are under the influence of drugs or alcohol. by british law (idk about irish), you cannot consent whilst under the influence as your judgement is impaired.

the list goes on...

i literally want to peel my own eyes out reading the number of posts everywhere about how Nikita must have been lying because she doesn't want the CCTV footage leaked to the public.

 1. point blank, by irish law, footage obtained via third-party cannot be published anywhere that is not directly related to the case i.e. nowhere outside the court room.

 2. personally, i wouldn't want footage of me prior to a traumatic incident published online either. and i don't think you would either.

 3. kissing doesn't equal consent. there's a startling number of cases in which vile people have R-worded / murdered their victims because they were kissing, but when they said no to sex, they flipped out because they assumed they'd get it. so whether she was kissing him in an elevator or not is quite frankly irrelevant.

and as a final note, i'd like to say...

there were 12 people in a jury who sat through all of the actual evidence, much of which we likely have no idea about. those 12 people came to a conclusion based on what was presented to them. so, who are you, a random person sat at home who's read a few newspaper articles and watched a few youtube videos, to overturn their decision? yes, verdicts can be wrong and have been overturned in the past. but that's in the hands of the professionals. so keep your victim-blaming, misogynistic comments to yourself and let the professionals sort it out.

as for SA survivors out there, please protect your own peace online. it hurts my heart knowing how many victims are reading these horrendous comments defending conor mcgregor, and the indirect impact it's having on them and their mental state.

16662,1i1ogj0,post,I can’t get over it?,"Hi yall, I (F17) was SA’d (raped? Idk the difference) about 2ish years ago when I was around 14-15 (I forgot what age). I wont use specifics but it was by my partner at the time. I didn’t say or do anything besides minor protests before freezing up. I said no but after the first few times gave up. It was violating and I bled slightly. It wasn’t the first time but it was the first time that affected me so much. It was on my bed in my room. I had to convince my parents to let me get a new bed. Then we moved. A year after I found out from a friend that they did to someone else at a party what they did to me, except this person wasn’t passive and I think that they served jail time or got a restraining order.

Idk the difference) about 2ish years ago when I was around 14-15 (I forgot what age). I wont use specifics but it was by my partner at the time. I didn’t say or do anything besides minor protests before freezing up. I said no but after the first few times gave up. It was violating and I bled slightly. It wasn’t the first time but it was the first time that affected me so much. It was on my bed in my room. I had to convince my parents to let me get a new bed. Then we moved. A year after I found out from a friend that they did to someone else at a party what they did to me, except this person wasn’t passive and I think that they served jail time or got a restraining order. I forgot. But I feel guilty. If I had stood up and not been passive I could’ve saved this gal so much trauma and trouble. I have terrible nightmares about seeing them, I relive it sometimes.

16672,1i1p6pu,post,Can a person be SA'd if they are sober and the assaulter is drunk?,"I (f21) was at a long weekend cabin trip with a group of friends, all female, all like sisters to me. On the second night, one of my friends (f28) got really drunk.

I was in the living room reading and by this point most of the girls I was with had gone to bed, fed up with my friends brash behavior. She had (jokingly) attempted to choke another friend (f24) in the hot tub before coming inside.

She climbed on my lap. Which I was a little uncomfortable with, but was used to her being touchy feel-y even when she was sober, so I went along with it. I did ask her to get off a couple times and go to bed, even nudging her a bit. At one point she grabbed my neck and also attempted to 'jokingly' choke me before getting off me.

I should've moved at that point, but I stayed in the living room and she came back. I was still protesting, pulling a blanket over me and such, but then she started licking my face. I'm sure she would've kissed me if I hadn't started pushing at her again. And at one point she groped my chest. I'm not too sure about the timeline of what happened that night since it was a few months ago, but regardless this did happen to me. 

I'm wondering if this is considered assault because she was drunk, and I was sober. Coupled with the fact that I didn't do much to stop her. I suppose I should also mention that I'm autistic (low support) and perhaps that could be another reason I need outside perspective.

16677,m785sgi,comment,,"I went through a very similar situation. I mean, all of the details were different, but the feeling of knowing that *something* was there but not having any specific memories to validate my feelings was incredibly frustrating.

The most important thing right now is to be kind to yourself. You're grappling with a disability/developmental trauma that can be downright crippling and you're doing the best you can to keep yourself functional while you figure this stuff out. You know that there's something to discover, and you have an intuition that it is something deeply unpleasant that you will struggle to cope with. It's wonderful that you have the support of your boyfriend while you struggle with this; I'm sure that he will be a huge resource for you as you work through it. But the best advice I can give is to find a therapist with extensive experience in treating trauma and CPTSD.

The dissociative episodes you've described are ""normal"" (as much as any of this can be considered 'normal') symptoms of PTSD. Dissociating as a coping mechanism has helped you get through some very difficult experiences, and it's not realistic to expect that you can just stop dissociating and handle everything you're thinking and feeling with confidence and self-assurance. Learning to really let yourself feel this stuff in your body and not immediately try to disconnect from the distressing sensations is a skill that you will need to deliberately practice and slowly get better at (ideally with the help of a therapist). Don't blame yourself when you struggle with feeling grounded or have a hard time letting yourself remember things that are probably the worst memories imaginable. Be patient with yourself and try not to feel like this is something you can get through by just forcing your way through and sprinting to the end."," I went through a very similar situation.

something that let me sleep again was trying to fall asleep in places different to the bed before moving myself back to bed. it’s because your body is going into fight or flight in bed now it associates bed with this stuff. try getting a sleeping bag or if you have an enclosed space or similar try sleeping there.

something that let me sleep again was trying to fall asleep in places different to the bed before moving myself back to bed. it’s because your body is going into fight or flight in bed now it associates bed with this stuff. try getting a sleeping bag or if you have an enclosed space or similar try sleeping there.

He also tried fingering me and sucking my breasts and i legit had to tell him to ask before touching me and to just touch me over my undies, and 10 minutes later he fingered me even after setting my boundries just because we flirted or kissed (can't quite remember what happened). he would do other stuff like touch me or put his D against my V and say shit like  ""i'm just teasing"" when he KNEW i was terrified of shit like that. He also tried kissing my neck twice when i said i really just wanted to cuddle and tried choking me. On other occasions  he took my undies off so many times and i'd ask if i could have them back and he straight up told me no. he also masterbating infront of me without asking me when i told him my trauma if an ex doing that. He got mad i didn't touch him back even tho i told him i was too scared too and if he was going to be jelouse then don't touch me?? he continued to touch me then afterwards he tried guilt tripping me ""but i touched you, but i think its fair enough"" he would exclaim stupid shit like ""i don't expect you to do anything, your freaking out because of your trauma, i don't think anyone owes me their body"" while he would contiously try ""teasing me"" by touching my breasts, thighs, put his dick near my V (this in particular happened a couple times.

I certainly didn’t view what happened to me as rape for a long time. I was coerced into having sex and I actually still, personally, don’t see that bit as rape or problematic. The line for me was when I was no longer in control - I asked him to stop and he didn’t. 

For some people that line is when they’re being pressured, for others it’s when they are in danger, etc etc. it’s something quite personal to the individual involved. 

That causes lots of problems obviously - someone can be fine with something at the time and later feel they were raped. This means that whilst they were raped, it’s specious to say the person who did it to them was raping them, strange as that sounds. This is where lots of men’s (well sometimes others but usually men) attempts to diminish rape on social media etc come from - it’s the feeling that nobody should have power over defining something retroactively, as society would cease to function lawfully if people couldn’t predict if an action they were taking was legal or not. 

So that brings me back to my feeling of needing better terms - that way these people online couldn’t cast doubt or confusion on things like this, or anyone’s stories, but also wouldn’t feel the need to (well in theory and for most sane people) because they aren’t seeing what they interpret to be something frightening.

16718,1i1wx0e,post,I forgave my step dad even after he continued to have sex with me after mums passing. TW: detailed ,"



My parents divorced when I was five, and my dad was never really in the picture from then on as I was staying with my mum. When I was 7 my mum got a new boyfriend and eventually got married and we ended up moving in with him. He was quite a rich man so the life we were living was great but on the other hand he was an alcoholic. 



One night when I was 10 years old he came home drunk to my room and raped me. He raped me when mum came storming in to my room when I was screaming for help which they ended up getting in to a nasty argument with him punching her and then pushing her over which ended up knocking her head and passing out while he stopped and went away. 



He the next day, sober, swore he'd make changes being very apologetic, that he'd never hurt me like that again. She asked me the next day if she wanted me to divorce him and I said no. I don't know why you would ask me that. We were so poor at the time, I know she probably couldn't have supported me. 



I don't know what it was about me but I used to see things when I was that age, things like other beings that come talk to me, which I don't see anymore. I'm not sure how to explain it but there were times where I would go and sleep with mum when I felt uncomfortable. About a year later there was one time when mum wasn't home and I ended up asking if it's okay to sleep next to him and I did. He was sober and I got woken up to him playing with my naked body. I started to protest but he shushed me and he said it's alright and that it's very normal but despite this that I should keep to myself. He would come wake me up deep in the middle of the night sometimes even when mum was home and in his bed to him playing with me or during the day when mum was not home to him gifting me stuff to give him blowjobs and stuff. I don't know if my mom knew about the things he did to me. I didn't tell her because I didn't want to hurt her if she didn't, and I think I had this idea that it was my job to keep our family together.



When I was 12 my mum passed away from a heart attack we were obviously both devastated. He went in to a complete depression, gave up his job, went through to hospital a couple of times as well. As time went along grief was much of what we held on to and through this started him being very close physically with me. 



After he moved me in to his room to sleep together things became somewhat of a ritual where it was not blowjobs or him playing with me anymore but we would have sex. Later as things progressed and became more routine I started to enjoy the weird feeling that I felt which later I understood was an orgasm and he got me on birth control and been on it ever since. He still drinks and at the rarest occasion gets violent but he was not as bad as he was to mum as he is to me. He is a great step dad when he was sober, it was almost impossible to believe that he was the same person who would hurt mum and smash things at night. I think I started seeing him as two different people - the dad who loved me and the stranger who had sex with me. Everything that happened feels like it happened to someone else. I feel like if he wasn't my step dad, I would hate him. 



When I got to highschool I was somewhat hyper sexual, this I have began to understand through the trauma over it and because I was used to it, although it should seem negative to most I didn't look at it that way and also what followed was a desire considering him and I had, I seeked for stuff with older men which I used to talk online and stuff. I went through a few boys, whether it be through random hook ups, relationships, or friend with benefit encounters. 



I don't think I deserve to think of myself as a victim of any of this when my life seems to have turned out well and with luxuries I have, when I've patched up these relationships. 



Has any one else ever forgiven their abuser/rapist? Do I just have some kind of advanced Stockholm syndrome? Am I wrong for forgiving him and stuff?","I forgave my step dad even after he continued to have sex with me after mums passing. TW: detailed

We are both prone to mental health issues due to childhood experiences.

Last year we had broken up for some personal reason, she had met a guy who brutally used her in ways she didn't consent to and it traumatized her. We got back together but things had changed. She would stop talking to me for days on end except a hey here and a one worded answer there and then she confided in me but she still kept abandoning me. Knowing she had mental health issues and trauma I was sympathetic and patient but that didn't stop her from it.

Few months later he convinced her he just wanted to talk and assaulted her and this made her condition worse. I kept warning her not to ever fall for his words but she did.

During this time she just kept moving from one group of friends to the other and sometimes she would be okay with me and other times she would abandon me again. 

I'm not going to lie I resented her a lot and it led to a lot of fights and misunderstandings and we were hanging by a thin line. 

Unfortunately during new years one of her friends drugged her and raped her despite knowing she was a victim. This time too I had warned her before to not just openly trust anyone so fast but she did.

I've been very supportive and patient but this frequent abandonment is killing me from inside. 

SA victims is this normal for those who have gone through the trauma? I'm so stuck coz I can't let go of her and find myself stressed and worried everyday but I can't handle being abandoned and she refuses to get help or even allow me to help

This was during my relationship when me and my ex gf were 22.


She has a high tolerance for substances and was an opioid addict and I have a lower tolerance and did not use. 

I wanted to leave the relationship and wasn’t really sexual much anymore. I was scared to leave because of her BPD episodes.

Anyhow,

We would drink sometimes with friends or just us. I got really drunk at this trans girls (who said she was lesbian) house with my ex gf. 

The trans woman tied blackout drunk me to a chair to watch her and my gf have sex. I kept passing in and out and even kept playfully saying “I think I’m a little bit blasted for this.” But just kinda sat there regardless.

My ex gf was enjoying herself a lot bc of some stimulating nipple cream and ended up going until I feel asleep and finally said something.

But, did my ex gf assault me, too? Just by being standby and letting this happen? They both thought it would be hot if I watched and were both maybe buzzed at best I don’t really remember. 

I’m just debating. My ex gf has been sexually uncomfortable before but I told my now boyfriend that “it wouldn’t be fair to label her a sexual abuser”.

Anyhow, thoughts? 

Sorry for the rambles.

16747,1i20lh4,post,My sister and my cousin S.A me ,"
Hi, I never talked about this with anyone other than trusted friends, it seems very strange to tell this to others, but I need to open up and have people who have been through this advise me on how to get over it.

I am a 16 year old girl, when I was 5 years old my 10 year old sister (now 21) and my 11 year old cousin (now 22) abused me on several occasions. For a long time I didn't remember what happened, I don't know if you've ever heard the theory that when you're a child your mind sometimes blocks the memories of your traumas to protect yourself, well that happened to me, for almost all of my childhood I didn't remember what happened. That happened, and if I remembered I didn't realize how serious it was.

When I was about 11 or 12 years old (in 2020) I started to remember what had happened, they were flashbacks, I remember one time I was sitting on my cousin's lap, we were playing video games, and he touched me. Then I remembered that sometimes with my sister we played ""house"" (one was the father, the other was the mother) and that was when everything happened, several times.


That caused me to have severe depression, I started cutting myself and years later I had three attempts to kill myself (fortunately I'm so stupid even for that, that none of the times worked), until one day I couldn't take it anymore and decided to tell everything to the school psychologist, I told her everything while I was having a panic attack, when I calmed down she took me back to class and called my dad to tell him everything 

Then I got home, my parents talked to me, they started crying and tried to console me because they realized I was cutting myself, unfortunately they didn't console me ""so well"", my dad started to tell me that what had happened was ""normal"" and that we were children, that it could have happened to anyone and that it wasn't a ""big deal""

That broke my heart, I felt that there was no point in telling them. Shortly after they took me to a therapist, she didn't help at all, when I had to tell her what happened she started asking me horrible and unnecessary questions like, what position was it in? HOW CAN YOU ASK THAT TO SOMEONE TRAUMATIZED, I couldn't even answer because I was crying uncontrollably just remembering what happened, I decided to stop going.

Little by little I began to ""heal"" myself, no one helped me, absolutely no one, I did everything myself, I feel that no one understands what happened unless they are victims too, I was able to ""improve"" my relationship with my sister (I forgot mention that I had the chance to talk to her about it, she told me that she was also a victim of my cousin, and that she didn't remember that she did the same thing to me, to this day I don't know if I believe her) but well, I never I was able to completely overcome it

To this day, unfortunately, I am still a depressed person, I don't even cut myself and trying to commit suicide but it is something that I cannot improve, it is something that has been wrong with me for years.

I just can't get over it, and I don't think anyone talks about the after-effects of being abused. Currently, as a teenager, I can't enjoy my sexuality freely because it makes me feel disgusted and guilty. At the moment, I do it, but the next day, I feel a feeling of total disgust for the person, for myself, and for the whole situation.

No matter how much time passes, I will never see sex as something normal. I will ALWAYS remember when I was abused. It's something that lives inside me. I can't help but relate sex to my abuse.

I feel disgusted, I can't imagine myself in a sexual way, when I was just starting to develop I felt disgusted thinking that I have boobs, I couldn't go around without a bra because I felt them there, I remembered that I am a sexual being and that they are there and people sexualize them, that I am not a child anymore, that I have sexual organs, and I felt VERY DISGUSTED

I will never enjoy having relationships with other people without feeling bad, or without feeling like a 5 year old girl being abused.

How do the rest of the victims manage to not feel disgusted? How do they manage to have sex with their partners? Did they ever get over what happened to them? Or do they keep thinking about it and remembering it every day like me?

I also don't understand people who have casual sexual relationships, with people they don't know, I don't understand it

and my biggest fear is being with a man who only sees me in a sexual way, and who uses me for that. When I fall in love with a man I don't even think about him in a sexual way. It's strange but it is like that. If it were up to me I could be married for 30 years and not have sexual relations. It's really not normal for me to feel sexual desires for other people, it's very strange. It also happens to me (I'm not homophobic) but I'm disgusted when I think about vaginas, and I can't see lesbians having sex because it disgusts me A LOT, but it's not that I hate them, I swear, long live lesbians, it's just because of my trauma.

and the relationship with my sister is still a bit strange, I can't forget what happened and I know she can't either, I'm trying to ""forgive"" her, and I never speak to my cousin, LITERALLY NEVER, he ignores me every time I see him, maybe he knows what happened and feels ashamed, I don't know, I never spoke to him

Does any other victim have any advice? Or if you want to answer whatever you want, I would like to hear the testimony of other people, always remember that it is not your fault, and if you need someone to talk to, I am here.","My sister and my cousin S.A me

16752,1i21yui,post,Is guilt tripping SA?,"If a woman in a relationship did not want to have sex with a man and the man stopped speaking to her and said something like ""I won't talk to you unless you have sex with me"" and the woman gave in to the demand and therefore technically ""consented"" but not out of her own free will, would that be SA?

likewise, if a man did the same. If his girlfriend refused to talk to him unless he had sex with her. Even after a verbal argument where the man says he does not want to have sex and the woman still pressures him with the same sentence ""I won't speak to you unless you f*CK me"" and refused to talk to him until he eventually gave her what she wanted and he said ""so If I have sex with you will you finally speak to me?"" (this situation occured numerous times)

I'm saying both scenarios because I'm a man who has gone through the second scenario. I'm a bit unsure but according to UK law, if the first scenario occured then the man could be a rapist because there was no consent present and the lady would not have consented with her freewill. Some examples I found on Google: ""I'll break up with you if you don't have sex with me/if you really loved me you'd do it/you don't know what you do to me""

 I'm unsure where I stand because I did not consent out of my own free will right? I told her I did not want to have sex, however I was made to feel like I have to otherwise my girlfriend (who I was staying with and depended on her for a lift home) made me feel like I have to, like it was transactional. (Now ex gf)

Am I being a pussy or is this something wrong that happened to me? It was a behavioural pattern. She used her emotions against me because she knew how sensitive she was and used that against me.

Again, UK LAW. As much as I appreciate engagement from the USA, it won't help me ❤️","Is guilt tripping SA?

 Seeing yes, out of coercion or agreeing to do something, watch something is not free will consent it’s manipulation and it’s sexual assault.

You do not have to say no you do not have to scream push somebody off of you walk away for it to be nonconsensual. All you have to do is not say yes. 

If you do not clearly say yes, then any of it all of it is assault. The only things that qualifies as consent is a clear yes, from somebody who is in the right state of mind. That’s it nothing else qualifies as consent, and the lack of saying no does not qualify as consent. The only thing that qualifies as consent, is YOU saying YES verbally, and a free will while being in the right state of mind.

Please, if you have the resources financially, seek counseling from a therapist/counselor maybe even call a hotline that is specifically qualified to deal with sexual assault if you cannot afford therapy . or find trusted family member friends to help Guide you through this difficult time.

I’m so sorry you were betrayed, and I hope that you can find peace, happiness, clarity, compassion, and understanding during this time of darkness, I promise you this there’s a light at the end of the tunnel you are that light . and you will burn brightly once you come to peace, this wound will always be with you but remember this you are a survivor you are a warrior you’ve been through a dark time and you’ve come through it.

16756,m7ati7c,comment,,"So this would be sexual coercion.
The definition is the same everywhere (so despite my being in Canada it still applies) adding onto that sexual coercion is in fact sexual assault and or rape.

Although Canada and the UK’s laws are very similar I still double checked to make sure that I was right.

I found a link that explains sexual coercion in the UK and the laws around jt. The subreddit won’t let me share it but if you do want to look at it yourself then it’s on the criminal injuries helpline under the section “sexual coercion in  domestic relationships”.

As someone that has been on the receiving end of sexual coercion when other people reply they may tell you that it’s not SA but it is.

I'd recommend focusing on the immediately practical coping skills that help you get through tasks like bathing, getting healthy sleep, and other self-care activities. And then expand to working on ways to cope with your symptoms while you take care of important tasks in your daily life, like work or school.

Don't feel like you need to push through this all at once. And try not to beat yourself up about the stress and anxiety you are feeling. They are normal reactions to PTSD triggers. One of the reasons that PTSD is so difficult to manage and treat is that on some basic level, the habits and symptoms work to keep you safe. Dissociation, hyper vigilance, and avoidance are all tools that helped keep you functional during and after the stuff you experienced. 

There are therapy modalities like IFS that I have found very valuable. IFS's main idea is that there are no ""bad"" parts of you. The parts of your mind that are causing these difficult symptoms are trying to protect you in a way that might have helped when you were very young or in a different situation, but are problematic in your current situation. Treatment isn't about defeating or overcoming the parts of you that cause these symptoms, it's about being compassionate with yourself while you process the feelings and memories linked to the trauma. With practice you can learn to regulate your nervous system better and find better ways to cope with things that trigger your PTSD.

Not knowing what exactly is triggering you is its own sort of misery, and I understand the temptation to keep poking and prodding at your brain to try to remember what is missing or at least to be able to articulate the thoughts or sensations that trigger your symptoms. But please try to take things slowly... I strongly regret many of the times I tried to speedrun my mental health treatment.

16759,1i23gqt,post,I don't know if I was SAd,"So I was 13F and I had crush on my classmate.
I went to his house to do homework, I thought we would have probably kissed. 

Things went way too far for me at that age, I wasn't ready for what he wanted to do.
He pushed me against a wall and forced me to touch him, I told him no multiple times and that I wasn't ready but he guided my hand anyway. 
He also touched me and undressed me, I felt very embarrassed and wasn't ready for that either, I tried to push his hands away. 
I was not screaming tho, nor I made it stop forcefully and ran away. 
I said no but I still let him do what he wanted, I still kissed him, I remember even laughing but thinking about it, it was probably a nervous laugh due to the embarrassment. 

He convinced me to perform oral sex cause ""it's easier than a handjob"", stupid inexperienced me believed him and thought I should just do as he said. 

The next day he bragged about it to everybody and I was made fun of. I thought I deserved it and that I was stupid and I accepted to do those things so it was entirely my fault, I shouldn't have trusted him. 

Now I'm 26 and when I think about it, my thoughts have kinda changed. I think that it was sa but I'm not sure since despite saying no I let him convince me and I went along with it. I surely have responsibilities on my part...but still it doesn't sit right with me. 

He also tried to kiss me again another time against my will, I told him to f off and he sent a long text of excuses, so I guess he had a pattern. 

What do you think?

Violated.. I feel sad and angry.. I feel partially responsible for what happened. I trusted someone I probably shouldn’t have.

I can’t help but feel violated.. I thought that all the times I told him I only wanted to used protection like condoms or birth control, that he would remember and respect that boundary I had.
I feel like it’s my fault for not checking if he had one on.. I trusted that he knew after the second time of asking previously that he would respect that wish. Man was I stupid. 
He always mentioned using the pull out method and I can’t help thinking of how childish even thinking that’s a reliable birth control method.
That night we had doggy style sex. I couldn’t see if he had one on. It was only after he had finished I realized he did not used one after seeing him without it. He mentions that he pulled out which only angers me more because I know for a fact that even when he did pull out, he eventually put it back inside me.. I could feel him pulsing inside me.. I would have never consented to this without a condom.

 How could he? Is he really that stupid? Or maybe he never respected that boundary in the first place..
I was SO lucky I had Plan B, without it I know for a FACT that he would have impregnated me.. And even still there’s that small chance.
What makes it worst is that when he knows I’m obviously upset and told him how I felt about what he did, he neglected to comfort me in any way..
It’s so stupid!! How could someone not understand what a woman goes through when in fear of becoming pregnant? What he doesn’t know is how long I spent awake that night, how I felt his cum dripping out of me, just laying there feeling used.. violated.. angry.. so many things went through my head including what I’m going to do if I did get pregnant? How could I let this happen? Was I not clear enough about my boundaries??
Well no, I’m done. I’m not going to let any man take advantage of me like this when my boundaries were explicitly stated to him. It’s clear he chose pleasure over the trust and respect that goes into sex.

I have repeatedly felt touched inappropriately by hands that *literally do not exist.* I feel ashamed to even be effected by it, since it wasn't real and trust me *I know that.*

I feel so dirty. Did I cause it? Was it some barely disguised fetish and I secretly ""liked it""? I don't. I didn't. I tried to get the hands off me so badly. I almost wanted to cry. I couldn't  get the hands off.

And these experiences have real world consequences in my life, I am paranoid someone real wants to do it. Talking about it makes me relive the sensory experience- it's not physically painful, but it's *very far* from pleasurable. My body feels violated thinking about this.

I'm not going to claim the distress is crippling or anything. I avoid thinking about it, avoid feeling feelings about it. After doing sexual things to myself I have intrusive thoughts about *what if I'm secretly trying to recreate what they did? What if I got aroused by it and didn't realise?

I often get sleep paralysis, and recently, I started getting hallucinations with them, which include re-living what my abuser did to me. Seriously, it felt like he was pinning me again.

16786,1i25ayu,post,"Any advice on dealing with 15 years since it happened, with a new partner while trying to move forward (f31) ","Disclosing sexual trauma



Hi everyone, (trigger warning SA) . 

I'm visiting my bf (M28) for the first time in March and I cannot wait for us to finally get time together. 
I had a friend say something incredibly triggering to me last night. That I should disclose my trauma around SA to my bf, as its a lot for people to deal with. 
This was super distressing to hear obviously. My partner already knew about the assault, but I realised I never checked if that was something that made him feel differently towards me. 
 We talked on the phone about it last night and told him everything I am struggling with. Including a couple of other situations I have been in in my past that also caused some sexual trauma and insecurity issues. 
 He is the most loving, supportive person I have ever met and he was brilliant, told me he would do anything he could to help. 
While I visit I will pass the date that marks 15 years since I was raped. He knows, I told him I could change my flight if he isn't comfortable and that I of course would understand, but he assured me absolutely not, that he still loves me the same and nothing has changed he just wishes he could help. 

So there's some back story, here's the help I'm looking for, does anyone have any advice on not being too much for a partner while dealing with this? 15 years feels like a lot and im worried about how upset I might be on that day. Any ways to ease that? Or tips on things to do to distract myself? 

Sorry for this post being a little heavy, but I'm really struggling today and looking for some advice. Please feel free to do if you have any tips or advice?

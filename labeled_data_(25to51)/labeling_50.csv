28761,m8e2ive,comment,,"Seek professional help for your depression and insecurity. Seriously, you are a 19F… you got your whole life ahead of you. Learning coping mechanisms, and perhaps meditation, can change everything. 
If you already talk to a professional… reach out to them! Perhaps set something up in a week and challenge yourself to write a 5 sentence synapse of how your day went and the feelings you had. It’s not always easy to dump when you’re in a session. Or even remember how/why you’re in a slump. Keeping a short daily record can help them help you.
And, this too will pass. Especially if you have someone in your corner. You’d probably be surprised how many people are rooting for you."," Seek professional help for your depression and insecurity.

28797,m8e9hlu,comment,,"Honestly if you don’t tell them and you try to go about your business like everything is cool it’s just going to manifest itself in another way. You’re going to start getting paranoid about them, your mood towards them will change, your entire dynamic will change for the worst. If you want to salvage the relationship you can tell them the truth and explain you made a mistake but there’s no guarantee it’s going to work out that way. You’re going to do far more damage if you don’t tell them. The only way you can get away with keeping the secret to yourself is to break up with them and keep the cheating to yourself. They don’t have to know, but the relationship can’t continue unless they know.

Honestly though. If your first instinct is to try to get away with it guilt free you don’t really care too much about them in the first place. Whether you tell them or not you should absolutely end the relationship regardless. You already cheated and now you want to get away with it. Why would you want to stay with them if you have no respect for them? 

I’m usually an advocate for working things out, but not in this situation. Do yourselves both a favor and end the relationship. One way or another this relationship is more than likely going yo fail. I’m sorry. This is very much a ‘better to get it over with sooner than later’ kind of situation. 

None of this makes you inherently bad. Cheating is never acceptable, but let it serve as a good lesson. Sometimes relationships don’t work out. This is the perfect example.

28798,m8e9ih5,comment,,"Here’s the problem with the “one time mistake” argument: it wasn’t.

It’s not like you stepped outside to go to work and accidentally had sex with someone else instead.

There was flirting. There was touching. There was escalation. Every step leading up to it was a new, conscious choice you made. And now there is lying. Another decision you make every day that you don’t come clean.

And when people do that and later claim it they don’t know how it went so far, it’s because they’re skipping over that part in their head. They still want to pretend that they had good intent. 

Statistically, no matter how much remorse someone expresses after cheating, they’re actually likelier to do it again than they were before. And it’s not because they don’t actually feel bad, but instead it’s *because* of that denial. Because if they stick to that self-deception, it means they aren’t examining the rationalizations and excuses they made for themselves which got them into that position in the first place. They won’t improve their boundaries or awareness or communication (how can you, if the most important thing to communicate remains a secret?). So they fall for it again.

Your moral compass is just that - a compass. It is not your driver; it tells you when something is wrong, but it will not stop you from making bad choices. You have to do that yourself. By doing the hard thing sometimes, whether it’s ignoring the cute person flirting with you, or telling the love of your life that you betrayed them. If you can’t even do that most crucial hard thing, you know you can’t trust yourself to do it later. 

So your first step is accepting that you are fully capable of doing this again. In fact, you’re statistically more likely to do so. Because you’re human. Not because you’re bad or because you were born without the “faithful partner” gene. That doesn’t exist. Being loyal requires active participation and *practice.*

It means you acknowledge that outside attention feels good, but isn’t worth the trouble it invites. It means you know you can do harm, but have a greater desire to do good - even when “good” is boring or not as appealing in the moment. 

Then you need to confess to your partner. If they are so wonderful that you cannot imagine losing them, then you should at least respect them enough to be honest. 

The more you sit there and insist (to yourself more than everyone else) that it could not happen again and you love your partner without actually coming clean, the more you entrench yourself in this belief that your words mean more than your actions and your desire to be with this person means more to you than what *they* deserve. That isn’t love. That is continuing to be selfish. And selfishness is what led you to cheat in the first place. 

So how can you really believe you will be better while claiming it’s okay to just lie to this person for what? Forever?"," Here’s the problem with the “one time mistake” argument: it wasn’t.

I know, from normal perspective, i won. But what does winning mean when no one knew you won?

It is with a therapist, and instead of talk, it is sensing into feelings and thoughts in the body, and processing it in a way that creates space. It  is similar in a way to mindfulness meditation in that it allows us to see that thoughts are not us, they are just thoughts, and we are just there to witness them and let them pass. Sensing into feelings is a way to release trapped emotions. It all makes things a lot less scary and hopeless."," I have felt very similar to this.

28875,1i6satr,post,What should I do about my strong urge to do men dirty,"So, I have a problem. I’m a senior in high school and have been in one serious relationship. In my first serious relationship, I had just turned 14 when we started dating and he was 16. It lasted for about 2 1/2 years. In that relationship he was horrible to me in all kinds of ways and cheated on me brutally. I mean the kind of cheating where he literally had other girlfriends while i was also his girlfriend. 

Considering that, I feel like it really messed me up. Because after that I started to cheat on him back. He was finally ready to settle down and gave me everything. All of his passwords, all of his attention, all his time and effort. And what I did was do him dirty like he did me. But he never found out. I know i should have left the relationship but i didn’t. I was young and did some dumb things but thats in the past now. What i’m saying is that I think that’s where my desensitization to cheating came from. 

What i need help with now is that I have this undeniably strong urge to do men dirty. Like make them fall for me and leave them hanging or cheat on them or something. Like really ruin their lives and make them regret everything. I have no idea why, I don’t understand why i want to treat men so poorly. I know it’s wrong inside that’s why I stay as far away from men as possible. I reject every guy that wants to be with me because i’m afraid of what i’ll do if i get involved with a guy. 

What should i do? I can’t get a therapist i don’t really have the money for that and i’d rather not tell people close to me about this issue that i have. Do i just stay away from men entirely? I mean will this feeling go away? I’m afraid i’ll give in soon. ","What should I do about my strong urge to do men dirty So, I have a problem.

Have you been building up your social network outside of work? Or does your work require a lot of travel, in which case are you going to the same places?

You can find people out there and make healthy connections, but you'll have to work at it and figure out what's feasible for you. 

In terms of no one knowing you won, get therapy first if you haven't already. Then figure out if you can handle these people begging you for handouts, or manipulating your future partner/children in order to get their hands on money. If you think you can do that, and you've done the work then fuck it let them find you on social media and post about living it up large throw some money around and be petty. 

I know everyone is against being petty. But when you've been fucked over hard, even someone passive can need that moment to be vindictive, petty or nasty. 

The goal is to do it, then once you're bored you let it go. You don't engage or let them make you angry, that might mean turning off notifications from them so you can't see messages. 

It's hard because you've survived and done that bit, so you're now in that stage thinking what now and what's next. You're still hurt too, and even if you've healed, you still carry some of that grief from being treated like that by arseholes. Always ask yourself if you'd ever do what they did to you, when you feel like shit and work on trying to move forward and forget them even if you need to be petty before you can do that.

You have money, so please use it to get all the help you can. That means therapy, try out yoga and mindfulness all the stuff you might think is silly but is supposed to help. 

Treat yourself the way your family should have treated you, and make up for it that way.

I really hope you can come back here one day to talk about how you've healed and you're in a better place.

I'm definitely hoping I'm going to be in a better headspace this time next year since I'm past the survival stage and stranded at the what next phase. But I'm going to force myself to figure out what I need to make me happy as the person I am now. 

You're not alone in this feeling, it can feel really isolating and a part of you wants to isolate since it's safe. But just take small steps to move forward and accept the shit days will happen because you're human."," I've cut a lot of people out and I'm rebuilding without the financial security you have.

I know it’s easy to feel like your worth depends on how others treat you, but it doesn’t. Your worth isn’t tied to anyone else’s actions or reactions. You’re valuable just as you are, even if it doesn’t feel like it right now.

These thoughts and emotions are heavy, and you shouldn’t have to carry them alone, I strongly recommend reaching out to a professional to help you work through these feelings.
And please make sure it’s someone who is qualified, like a licensed psychiatrist or therapist—someone you can trust who truly understands what you’re going through.

They’re there to support you and guide you through this, and you deserve to have someone in your corner who knows how to help. I can’t recommend it enough—it’s not a sign of weakness; it’s a step toward taking care of yourself. And I want to say this: if the first therapist or professional you see doesn’t feel like a good fit or doesn’t help much, please don’t give up. People are different, and finding the right therapist can take time. It doesn’t mean you can’t get better or that you’re beyond help—it just means you might need to try someone else. Please Keep going until you find the help that works for you.

You deserve to see that for yourself. You deserve to feel valued and happy. Please give yourself the chance to experience that. Please take that step to get help—you deserve it.

Also you don’t have to go through this alone, and there’s no shame in getting help. In fact, asking for help is one of the strongest and most caring things you can do for yourself.

I know my words might sound cliché or like something you’ve heard before, but that doesn’t make them any less true. Sometimes, when we’re struggling, it’s easy to ignore these words, but please believe me when I say that you do matter. You matter because you exist.

Edit: don’t wanna armchair diagnose anyone, but I think it’s helpful to point out where symptoms COULD come from considering doctors never seem to know and we have to research ourselves. On the off chance you do have a disorder, it’s important to consider if you have any other symptoms so you can ask for the right treatment and possibly get benefits that will help you recover (like discounted counciling)"," Hm well most people I’ve known with OCD has been a fear of them doing something terrible, hurting someone they love even though they’d never do that, they worry that something will posses them to do it.

But what I took from your post is that you acted out while in a terrible place as a kid and just because it happened already you worry you’ll do it again, yeah? I hope you feel better❤️

Edit: don’t wanna armchair diagnose anyone, but I think it’s helpful to point out where symptoms COULD come from considering doctors never seem to know and we have to research ourselves.

Subject to change. But yeah definitely not financially rich z

But then, there’s emotional freedom and richness in that; even with nobody and no ability to buy stuff or travel or etc, I’m the most joyful person I know even in my darker days, and I feel FILTHY rich in my freedom, my ability to adapt, the fact I’m starting to do things which will lead to other things that get me perhaps allllll the stuff and money and people I want.

Both! My choice as well as my treat! 

There’s something about getting free from things or ideas that can make one feel rich.

He wound up homeless with zero retirement savings and last I knew told me eff off because I was trying to help him but also being real with him about what he can and can’t bring to the local homeless shelter…

That, and I care, have big dreams I’d like to make reality, but need the “knowledge of money and business” as to how to get from dreaming to doing. If you’ve got a lot of money, I bet youve got some knowledge, too? 🤷🏼‍♀️

28928,m8f2vdk,comment,,"Have you tried melatonin? I'm 35, and my whole family are night owls. We all struggle with early mornings, and I had a really hard time getting to classes when I was younger. Fortunately, my job doesn’t have a strict start time, so I’m in a good position. Some days, I even start as late as 10:30 a.m. As long as I get my work done, everything’s fine.

However, I got tired of staying so late at work, so I got a prescription for 5 mg of melatonin to help me fall asleep earlier—and it’s been a game-changer. For the past two weeks, I’ve been waking up at 7 a.m. and getting to the office by 8 a.m. It feels amazing to leave work at 4 p.m.

When I’m getting ready for bed, I still catch myself scrolling through my phone. But once the melatonin kicks in, my eyes start feeling heavy, and that’s my cue to put the phone away and go to sleep. Also, by taking melatonin at the same time every day, I’ve managed to feel tired at the same time each night. This has helped me fall asleep consistently and establish a proper sleep schedule.

If you’re having trouble falling asleep on your own, melatonin is definitely worth a try. Just remember, drinking caffeine later in the day can interfere with how tired you feel in the evening. I’ve set a rule for myself not to drink coffee after 2 p.m.—though I make an exception on weekends.

I’ve tried everything, but this seems to work best for me. If you’re an anxious person, that can also make it hard to fall asleep. Anxiety prevents your body from relaxing, leaving you feeling tense, worried, and unable to sleep. If melatonin doesn’t do the trick, consider trying something else—like muscle relaxants, sleep music, or other calming techniques—to help your body relax and unwind.

Personally, I sleep like a baby with sleep music playing on my phone all night until I wake up. Small things can make a big difference!"," Have you tried melatonin?

So, Let’s cut to the chase here OP. you’re playing with fire, and if you give in to these urges, you’re not just repeating the cycle of pain; you’re actively choosing to become the same kind of person who fked you up emotionally. What happened to you was awful, no doubt, but dragging that toxic baggage into new connections and intentionally trying to destroy others is pathetic, vindictive, and straightup fkin cruel.

 You’re letting your ex live rent free in your head while you fantasize about ruining men who likely have nothing to do with your past. Guess what? The world doesn’t revolve around you nor does it owe you retribution, and no amount of making others suffer will heal your wounds.

 The problem isn’t ""men"", t’s you, your unprocessed trauma, and your refusal to face it head on. Saying you “stay away from men” isn’t noble; it’s avoidance, a fkin cop out that saves you from accountability. If you want to stop being a trainwreck waiting to happen, get over your excuses. Therapy costs money? So do toxic decisions when they blow up in your face, trust me, the emotional debt will be far worse. 

You can’t keep blaming your teenage pain for your adult choices. Either grow up, deal with your issues, and break the cycle, or keep walking this path and watch as you slowly morph into the exact monster you claim to absolutely despise. The choice is yours, but understand that continuing down this dark path will only bring you even more pain, not healing.

It hurt like hell but somehow I got through it. I had some temporary friends along the way and grew out of touch with them.

I was the loneliest person growing up - had no one to talk to at school didn’t fit in class, was the only person without a partner in a classroom of 30. It hurt like hell but somehow I got through it. I had some temporary friends along the way and grew out of touch with them. The friends I have today (at the age of 23) are the ones that stay in touch (I will say that I hang out with my friends only 3/4 a year) they are people I have known for a long time - some which I had initially considered acquaintances. If you are lonely - I hope you remember that there is nothing wrong with you, you are just surrounded by people who do not get you. Reading responses to this post is an indication of hundreds of people out there who will accept you for who you are.

Loneliness is the most difficult thing for us to deal with as Humans. I'm lucky, I'm an introvert, I can spend hour, upon days and even weeks alone without issue. I feel your pain. Nobody hates you. The only person that hates you is you. I grew up having to take seizure medication from age 1 to age 4. This medication chemically retarded my development. By the time I entered school I was 1.5 years behind the other kids in terms of development. I grew up thinking I was different and wrong for being alive. I thought everyone hated me and that I was a failure. This perception and low self esteem later in life caused me to develop deep addictions to cope with my pain. I remember always feeling so lonely, all of the time. I did have some friends though.  Those friends are still friends of mine today. They love me for who I am regardless of the short comings early on. It didn't matter to them. If you don't have good buddies like that you should try and find some.

Examples, I loved motorcycles and surfing. I rode motorcycles in the desert and I have those friends today. If you love exercise you will join an exercise group, if you love your work, you will make work friends, if you love to play dungeons and dragons you will join a group and play dungeons and dragons, if you love aviation you will join a group and find the best friends you could ever hope for. Do you get the idea? Then when you put out an invitation to a F'ing Coldplay concert, people will gladly show up. Here is the true test of a friend..

Remember Love yourself or none will love you.

Find your happy place and do more of that, friends will come from that.

You don’t need money for fancy memberships, look for community centers, free outdoor workout spots, or just start with bodyweight exercises at home. The gym isn’t just about surface level physical transformation. It's  a mental battlefield where you develop: discipline, resilience, and a sense of control over your life. That’s exactly what you need right now.

When you commit to showing up and pushing yourself, you’ll see progress that’s entirely yours. It’s empowering to realize that even when life feels out of control, you can build strength literally and mentally one step at a time. Exercise helps clear your head, releases built up frustration, allows you to channel your negative thoughts to fuel your workout and main of all, boosts your mood through endorphins. Plus, having a routine gives you structure, which you desperately need right now since you're trapped in this endless loop of emotional instability.

Stop waiting for everything to fall into place. Waiting it out is just another excuse to stay stuck. Look into free or sliding scale type counseling, online support groups, or even free apps with mental health tools. Moreover, Journaling, mindfulness, and self reflection cost nothing. And when you combine that with a consistent workout routine, you’ll start building a solid momentum toward real change.

You already know the alternative right: staying miserable af, stuck in bitterness, and dragging others down with you into a toxic hellhole. Don’t let your past dictate your future. Prove to yourself that you’re capable of becoming stronger not in just one but in every aspect of your life. 

The reality is, there is no one coming to save you or anyone, but you can save yourself. 

Getting to wake up each day is a blessing that many people take for granted.

29006,m8fax0y,comment,,"Might even help to peruse reddit for stories where men are screwed over in similar ways. Learning that there are vulnerable men too not just women and they are hurt by others. 

I read this story just this morning about a man’s 6 year relationship finally moving toward marriage. She got pregnant and he proposed, but she became colder and more defensive of her phone so he decided to check after ominous words from his best friend about Him ignoring her red flags. 

He found out she was cheating on him with her ex from HS and got pregnant with the man. He knew she was pregnant with his child yet he encouraged her to marry and stay with her fiancé so they could “ cuckold” him and she could divorce him after the baby was born and take child-support/alimony. She bragged about how OP was so gullible she could tell him anything and he would believe it. 

When OP was sending screenshots to himself for proof his girl woke up and saw him on her phone. He kicked her out and she happily left not having to “pretend” anymore. She then proceeded to lie to his family saying He cheated on her and they blocked him and told him he wasn’t welcome home for x-mas. She went to His parents house for Christmas and got presents for her new baby. It took till after the new year for the truth to come out. By then she refused to give back the ring and any gifts the family gave her for their first grandchild. That wasn’t even theirs.  

This woman not only totally devastated that man she also weaponized his family against him. Damaged their relationship that might never be the same again. 

Maybe if you started listening to more stories about what it is like for these men you’ll stop believing that all men deserve that level of manipulation, punishment, and heartbreak. 

I am sorry you were hurt in the first relationship you had. I hope you can open up your heart to learn that even though cheating happens a lot. There are plenty of people out there who have seem the damage it does. To individuals and to families.

For as long as I can remember, I’ve had this pattern where I only fall for significantly older people, and it always happens when they’re kind to me. It’s like I can’t help myself. If someone older treats me with genuine care, patience, or even just basic sweetness, I’ll catch feelings. Every. Single. Time.

I know it’s not right, and I know it’s not healthy. I’ve told myself over and over again that it’s not normal to immediately feel this way just because someone older is kind, but it keeps happening. I’m not sure if it’s something about the maturity or the sense of safety they give me, but it feels so automatic. The worst part is, this has happened multiple times now, and every time I end up feeling stuck and confused.

It’s not like I go out looking for older people to like—if anything, I’ve actively tried to avoid it. But when someone older is sweet to me, I can’t stop myself from feeling drawn to them in a way I know I shouldn’t be. I know there’s something deeper here that I probably need to work on, but I don’t know where to start.

If anyone else has experienced something similar or has advice on how to break this cycle, I’d really appreciate hearing from you. I want to understand why I’m like this and figure out how to stop falling for people just because they’re nice to me.

29075,m8fp1jp,comment,,"Man, you didn’t just leave the relationship—you went **full ghost mode**, new country, fresh identity, **CIA-level disappearance**. Respect. But let’s talk about what’s really going on here.

First off, let’s be real: she wasn’t just **cheating on** ***you***, she was **cheating on** ***herself***. When someone betrays others **so compulsively**, it’s not because they’re evil masterminds reveling in destruction—it’s because they’re trapped in their own **self-worth dumpster fire**. As Nelson Grey writes in **Chapter 7: Transforming Pain Into Compassion**:

*“Pain, though often isolating, holds the potential to connect us in profound ways—to ourselves, to others, and to the shared humanity of suffering. When we turn inward with compassion, we begin to transform our pain from something that burdens us into something that deepens our understanding and strengthens our connections.”*

She’s stuck in a **cycle of self-destruction**, seeking validation in all the wrong places, using people like **emotional scratch-off tickets**—hoping to finally hit the jackpot of feeling **enough**. And you? You took the damage like a champ, **absorbed the hits**, hoped she’d change, and when you hit your breaking point… **you ran**. Which, let’s be clear, is a **totally valid trauma response**.

But here’s the thing—you **don’t have to stay in that darkness**. You **can’t** let her betrayals define the rest of your life. You **can** take this as a messed-up, painful **initiation into self-discovery**. Yeah, it **sucks**. Yeah, it’s **unfair**. But you’ve already done the **hardest part—you left**. Now comes the part where you **figure out who** ***you*** are when you’re not playing **emotional janitor** to someone else’s chaos.

Take a **breath**. You don’t have to have **all the answers** yet. But start by realizing this: You’re **not damned** if you do or don’t—you’re only **damned if you let her mistakes become your permanent prison**.

And since you’re clearly thinking deep, here’s something worth reading: [**https://a.co/d/9XPaY3i**](https://a.co/d/9XPaY3i) Because if you’re gonna **rebuild**, might as well have a **good blueprint**.

Keep going. You’re **closer to freedom than you think**."," Man, you didn’t just leave the relationship—you went **full ghost mode**, new country, fresh identity, **CIA-level disappearance**. Respect. But let’s talk about what’s really going on here.

First off, let’s be real: she wasn’t just **cheating on** ***you***, she was **cheating on** ***herself***. When someone betrays others **so compulsively**, it’s not because they’re evil masterminds reveling in destruction—it’s because they’re trapped in their own **self-worth dumpster fire**. As Nelson Grey writes in **Chapter 7: Transforming Pain Into Compassion**:

*“Pain, though often isolating, holds the potential to connect us in profound ways—to ourselves, to others, and to the shared humanity of suffering. When we turn inward with compassion, we begin to transform our pain from something that burdens us into something that deepens our understanding and strengthens our connections.”*

She’s stuck in a **cycle of self-destruction**, seeking validation in all the wrong places, using people like **emotional scratch-off tickets**—hoping to finally hit the jackpot of feeling **enough**. And you? You took the damage like a champ, **absorbed the hits**, hoped she’d change, and when you hit your breaking point… **you ran**. Which, let’s be clear, is a **totally valid trauma response**.

But here’s the thing—you **don’t have to stay in that darkness**. You **can’t** let her betrayals define the rest of your life. You **can** take this as a messed-up, painful **initiation into self-discovery**. Yeah, it **sucks**. Yeah, it’s **unfair**. But you’ve already done the **hardest part—you left**. Now comes the part where you **figure out who** ***you*** are when you’re not playing **emotional janitor** to someone else’s chaos.

Take a **breath**. You don’t have to have **all the answers** yet. But start by realizing this: You’re **not damned** if you do or don’t—you’re only **damned if you let her mistakes become your permanent prison**.

Sub sandwiches work great or leaving that big bag of chips or drink in the cart as you put your bags in. ""Sorry I got confused and forgot what I put in and put out!"" is all I would need to say--and it has never happened.

You need to get some perspective which only comes through self examination and asking why you're extrapolating the behaviour of one person to every single man and trying to make them pay for mistakes they didn't commit. 

It sounds like you've had your feelings hurt and your ego damaged with feelings of not being enough, so you want to feel enough by becoming unobtainable and causing pain to good people who care just to hurt them. 

Make better choices and instead of this dehumanising sociopathic bullshit, remember how it felt to be in that position yourself, and consider now you're deliberately wanting to cause that.

So growing up I(late 20s M) had a terrible relationship with my mother. As bad as can be. She never used to constantly insult and belittle my intelligence everyday. She would emasculate me constantly in front of others. When my friends would invite me to hang out she used to grab me and pull me to the side and tell me that I was forcing them to invite me to places against their will and that they didn’t actually want to hang out with me. I say that to say I had a terrible relationship with my mom and it made me very emotionally needy with women. Replace “older people” with “any girl” and I was exactly like you. But all that changed when I read a book called “Anxiously Attached: How to be Secure in Life and Love” by Jessica Baum. That book taught me that the reason why I kept falling for any women that showed any kindness was because I never healed my Inner Child Wound. The pain I felt from my mom’s abuse never healed and it was what was subconsciously making me so needy for women’s approval/desire/attention.

29158,1i6xnhc,post,"I had a miscarriage, my mom had a baby and now my brother is also becoming a dad","Hi guys, 

So for context I guess you can say I am very hurt. I found out I was pregnant back in July with my baby due in April. My pregnancy was super stressful! For one, me and my partner didn’t even live in the same country ( I lived in America and he lived in Sweden). Right when I found out we were going to have a baby for a few weeks he said it wasn’t dueable and we talked about abortion. I just couldn’t bring myself to do that so I decided to keep the baby.

Then right after I explained to my family that I was going to keep the baby my mom immediately cut me off of my health insurance saying how my bf needed to pay for all of the medical bills with the pregnancy. Fast forward I left her house to move into a new place with my aunt. 

My aunt put me in Christian birthing classes ( I was pregnant out of wedlock so it was a huge guilt thing) on top of my bf not wanting to move to America. Then I find out my mom got pregnant on purpose so we can have the baby around the same time.

Long story short my mom and I don’t speak for months and the day before I am expected to move I loose the baby and deliver her within 12 hours at 22 weeks. My bf didn’t want to name the baby at first but because I had to sign the death certificate i had him pick the name. 

Now my mom gives birth to a girl and gives the baby (my new sister) my babies name! On top of that she asks me even to this day a year later why I couldn’t have a baby like she did.

Now I am just finding out that my brother is going to have a baby after my family kept it a secret from me and I can’t help but feel some type of way about it. I feel like not only was I not allowed to do my duty and be a mom and carry my child full term but now I have to act like I’m proud for my brother when in reality I am devastated.

It has been a year and I have not talked about my feelings to anyone not even my partner. I think it’s difficult for my partner to hear because it’s not really something he likes to discuss but I am still stuck on the what could’ve been. My question is am I wrong for not being happy about my brother? He has done nothing wrong to hurt me and I know that bringing a child into the world is supposed to be a blessing but I guess I am just wondering what happened to my blessing?

I broke up with him (partner of 2yrs) and moved in with his friend. I signed a lease with my ex, we shared a phone plan and worked together. He insisted I leave all my things there because he wasn't ready to let go. We had a couple fights about this and I decided to leave it. Figured it would be easier to wait until he was ready. He was taking the break up horribly. The friend was more a ""mutual"" friend and by the time I moved in he was more my friend. My partner randomly cuts ppl off and that's what he did to him. 
     I left my partner because he was an alcoholic and occasional substance abuser. He would lie, manipulation, gaslight, and just do hurtful things. No matter how much I beg them to stop and told them they had a problem. A week later the friend and I started being intimate. Horrible decision I know. I was just trying to run away. I had spend two years trying to get myself to leave and I thought this would ensure I wouldn't go back. This went on for two months. By the end of the two months my ex was still trying so hard for us to get back together. He sobered up and started doing the things he said he always would. I caved I told him I wouldn't see or sleep with anyone else (I broke it off with the ""friend"" disclaimer we were never dating, it was just arrangement.--- again that's what my ex asked both of us to do) while we ""worked"" it out. We were gonna take it slow. He knew I was sleeping with the friend. I never lied or tried to hide it. 
     Shortly after this I had to leave state. My uncle was dying. I left he took me to the airport..etc. we called every day, blah, blah, blah. Well the day after I left he started seeing someone else and didn't tell me until weeks later. He randomly dropped it and when I had a sour reaction that's when things really hit the fan. He got insanely controlling. Spent the rest of the month lying and tormenting me. When I got back and he saw me he had a HUGE breakdown. He slept with the other person multiple times after swearing he hadn't. This all came to light when I got home. Yes I already figured as much. Apparently they were in a full blown ""relationship"" and I knew the girl too. She was my friend. He instantly broke things off and blocked her. 
I had moved back in before I left state. So I was living with him, not involved for awhile because of this. It took 3 months before I could even look at him. He's been so kind. I told him we can try... But I'm not sure what I'm doing. This was almost 6 months ago and I still think about it daily for hours.

But based on what you said, this sounds like something that could haunt you for years. I've had struggles in this department myself, and I've known girls who can't have healthy relationships with guys anymore because they couldn't get past high school trauma. Same with many guys unfortunately.

Look into Christianity. Read the Bible, learn the basic teachings, maybe go to church with religious friends or a school club if there is one. It's hard to explain but a spiritual outlook will help you put trauma in perspective. You'll also be able to forgive and move on more easily.

The other thing I'd say is learn the difference between a good and bad guy. Your ex was probably charming, maybe good-looking, but he had terrible character. A lot of guys are like that. If you're able, you may want to ask your dad about this, men tend to see each other for who we are. Personality is how you come across, character is who you actually are and the values you hold.

Your mom sounds like a piece of work! Keep toxic people at a distance. i know it's hard when it's family. What she did is just cruel. No good mother would do this to their child. They would hold them, cry with them, and grieve with them! If my daughter lost her child, I would have her curled up on my lap like when she was 2! Hold her until she is ready for me to let go.

My social worker just left from talking me down, again, and all I can tell you is, when I was your age, I couldn't see a future, and I couldn't conceive of what all those well-intentioned people who didn't know what I was going through kept saying.

""Hang in there. I gets better."" (Yeah? When? How?)

""Just go to the movies/get laid/read a book/get a hobby/think of your loved ones..."" (Are you kidding me? I'm ~~suicidal~~ having a crisis and you think watching a movie will help?)

Etc, etc, etc. But I kept having stupid little things force me to stay alive, which meant I got dragged kicking and screaming into that future that did get better, and yes, I hated that those people who have no idea of what it feels like to have no hope were right.

That was the script for about fifteen years. Suffering, surviving, taking every tiny win I could get, hating myself with a rage I would never show another human or animal.

Then I received a miracle of chemistry, and new meds for BPAD 2 (mixed states) came onto the market. They did NOT cheer me up...they made it possible for me to go 17 years not trying to kill myself.

For whatever reason, they stopped working three years ago, so I am back to suffering through life. But now I have people who count on me, whom I cannot let down. I have (a very few) meaningful relationships. And yes, it's been day to day, hour to hour, suffering from mental and physical wounds, and seriously, my social worker did just leave after helping me through today's crisis, but having given me another innocuous tip for being alive when I wake up.

I hear you so loudly, and so painfully, but I know this is a battle you need to fight. People can support us, but we must show up for the struggle.

If it does happen to you, or to anyone else who reads this, you can use it as proof that, yes, you are in terror, and hopefully learn to use that knowledge to know to reach out.

I wish I could tell you a nice story about how wonderful things get, and all the wonderful things you would miss out on, but this is your story, and you need to reach out in hope that things will get better. To fight to have hope.

Ultimately, we live because we find hope. Please, reach out and find it.

I was in a very similar position to you about two years ago when I had just gotten a divorce. I’m almost 22 now and looking back I see how much of a gift it was to be set free from the situation I was in.
I had just moved home and was living in a tent outside my house during the late summer and all I had was my immediate belongings and my gaming laptop. I played games all day and lived off of money leftover tuition. I was SO insecure, I loathed myself because I thought I wasn’t gonna get to live the happy life I had thought out.
I worked at a job I didn’t like very much and called off a lot despite only working like three days a week. Depression was kicking my butt but I kept thinking to myself “I’m still here, I can literally do ANYTHING. I don’t have to hold back for anyone” 
And I thought of all the times I hated my life in the past and thought “I’m still here, all the reasons I had to hate life back then seem so immature”
And it hit me that even if I always feel down, and even if I always hate my life, my past self is looking at me thinking “wow that’s so much better than before”
So now that it’s been an almost two years and I see how different and how much better I’ve gotten I feel like I just needed time. I also decided I’m not allowed to off myself until I have gotten over all my setbacks and still hate life. Cause if I had offed myself because life was hard back then and it felt like nothing was worth it, I wouldn’t have found out the pain was in fact worth it. I got past so much pain and it honestly feels amazing. And I did it by simply letting the hard things be hard. 
I went from struggling to keep a 20hr job to successfully working a 40hr job by letting it just be hard.

I went from hating being single and feeling worthless to finding myself and knowing I’m okay on my own by just letting the pain work its magic

I went from wishing I hadn’t been born to being so excited for what life can throw at me by finding opportunity in everything I can. 

Moral of the story is don’t off yourself because it’ll get better in the strangest, most roundabout ways.

It might just be that you are doing better than every single one of your friends.

I am 50 & it took me YEARS to realize that I am more financially secure, happier, doing better in my career than 90% of all of my friends.

Here I was bitchin about how shitty I thought that my life was & I thought my friends resented me for what a loser I am when in reality, I was bitchin’ and complaining about minutia compared to their shitty life.

I have almost no friends any more because I have outlived some, some are all fked up or in jail. Some are too “p ssy whipped” to have a guy friend. I am doing vastly better than them.

I know you’re probably not going to read this or most comments, you’ve seen and heard it all.

At the same time, you know for a fact everyone who’s offering help here most likely knows you’re not going to actually reach out, they genuinely DONT care (because they don’t know you) and you probably see through all the fakery of offering help, support, numbers etc.

You’re alone, no one truly understands your situation and the more people try, the more they convince you that you’re correct. Because no one else is YOU. 

As I said, typing this I’ll tell you right now. I’m going to reply to this and forget I ever commented. I DO NOT care about you in the sense you need and you know it.

I’m here from my own interest because of shared experience.


I can see how logical you’re being, you’ve analysed your situation fully. You’ve convinced yourself it’s not worth it anymore. 

I’ll propose you one thing, and it may or may not work for you. This is what I did

Get up, stare at yourself in the eyes. Truly, stare and reflect. You might not even feel like yourself. 

Look at your reflection, your eyes, observe your features. 


No one else on this planet who has, hasn’t or will exist will look exactly like you, literally not a single soul. You are YOU, yourself. You are whether you like it or not, logically, the most special person among every other person on this planet. Good or bad, doesn’t matter


Reflect on your life, your situation, your childhood. Look DEEP, are you truly in the right headspace to make such a permanent decision? To end something truly special, never to exist again? 

You’re not ending the suffering if you do. You’re ending existence. 

Existence is suffering, joy, EVERYTHING in one. It’s evil, it’s beautiful, and you’re experiencing it.  


You’re not taking medication and ending emotional or physical pain if you follow through

You’re ending your experience of reality. 

You will NEVER experience this AGAIN.

Really, really dwell on that. 

It doesn’t matter truly whether you’re suffering or not, this decision is permanent and there are ALWAYS ways out of everything in life. 

Stare into your own soul, remember yourself as a child. That child is yourself, the only one who will ever be you.


They deserve to experience life’s ups and downs, they deserve to suffer, they deserve to struggle, they deserve to be happy, to have joy, they deserve to exist.

Just by reading your post, I have a hunch that you feel you don't have a purpose. Trust me, most of us feel exactly the same.

It's about finding things that give you genuine happiness. It is difficult, I know because I felt same around that age. But as you grow, you'll know that life is about simpler things and small steps everyday. Your current daily routine is either survival or killing time to avoid reality. You probably don't feel that you belong.

What helped me was volunteering, not the ones you do for others, but for yourself. The ones that come with genuine appreciation from the receiver and nobody else like giving someone needy a meal. And/Or the ones that make you feel content, like cleaning up a local park by yourself or even better, your room. 
Other thing - make friends. It might seem hardest thing to do in life right now. So easy way is - find groups of your interest so you enjoy the hobby while being around people. Loneliness is a poison, we often ignore it...
So hang in there, I know you've got it. If you need to talk to someone, you have so many people commenting and dm'ing you. Talk to them, I'm sure they'll be happy to make a new friend. dm me if you want. But whatever you do, just know that you are enough and you got this.

29301,1i720ci,post,I am utterly useless and a complete waste of space,"
P.S. This is pretty long so my apologies in advance. I just needed somewhere to vent.


I 17F just want to die but I’m honestly too much of a fucking coward to go through with it. The reason being the fact that i’m so fricken useless, a literal waste of space. I’m not attractive or pretty in any sort of way and nor am I academically intelligent. The thing is it’s not like i don’t try, i do, but the stress and anxiety of failing always prevails in the end, causing me to always blank out during exams and tests. It’s so pathetic. And believe me when i say i did not disappoint this year as I failed the majority of exams with flying colors. 

Normally, my lowest grade be between 75-85 in either combined science or biology but this year, my final year, i failed to score a 60% on both. Additionally, not only did i failed both sciences but also math and geography. Now i’m not blaming anyone but myself for this because i’m aware thats it’s my fault and my fault alone but man this hurt. My parents work so hard to put me through private school and i’m scoring fucking lottery numbers on my exams. And to add onto that, report cards come out tomorrow. 

Lately, dying is all i think about. My parents deserve so much better yet they ended up with me. A dumb and ugly ass bitch. Nothing more, nothing less. Furthermore, i ended up being nominated to be one of the school’s head prefect and I’m considering bringing the shirt in tomorrow. There are so many better contestants that could’ve been chosen and i just feel as though they’ve been robbed. I just know the principal regrets nominating me because honestly i know i would. I’m positive most of my teachers hate me especially my math teacher but i honestly can’t even blame her because i hate me too. I constantly berate myself for everything and anything and lack both self esteem and confidence. (At least i’m self aware). Every time something goes wrong in my life (which is very often) my first initial thought is to go die somewhere. 

I know that i shouldn’t be thinking this way and that i clearly need someone to talk to but i don’t want to be a burden or inconvenience to anyone. People have better things to do. Same thing applies even with my best friend, whom might i add is literally one of the most amazing and intelligent person i know. I can’t find it in me to burden her with my thoughts, it just feels wrong and selfish. And don’t get me wrong i love her and she’s a great person, but lately i just feel our friendship hasn’t been the same and it’s honestly my fault. She recently got into a happy relationship with a boy from school and i can’t ruin that. I want her to be happy. 

We’ve been best friends for nearly ten years and have shared nearly everything with each other. Have been there for each other when things got rough. Have cried on each other but i just can’t find it in me to say help. Help me please. She doesn’t know that i have these thoughts and honestly i’d like to keep it that way. Bottled up. 

I just wanna die. Die for being a pathetic loser. Die for being a dumbass. Die for letting my parents down. And die for being a waste of space. Life just isn’t worth living anymore if i’m just gonna continue being a failure. Why couldn’t God just make me naturally smart? Or pretty? One or the other or maybe even both. Why both stupid and ugly? A double fricken whammy. Like pick a struggle. Also, i just wanted to clarify that i don’t view others this way, just myself. :) 

Even now while typing this and proofreading it i feel stupid. Why I bothered to even type this up and post it on here like anybody cares? I don’t know. Nobody gives a damn. I could die tomorrow and nobody would give a damn and that would be okay. I’m not worth giving a damn about anyways. 

Again, i’m sorry to people that actually took the time out of their day to read this bullshit. May God bless you all and have a good day. :3

29324,m8hf51a,comment,,"Sorry about what you’re dealing with man. I can give you some tips. Try to change your phone or wipe it if you can’t get a new phone. Second thing to do is disconnect your personal device from your home Wi-Fi because that’s very likely how she’s able to do these things. Get a new router and don’t allow her connect to it ever.

Second thing to do is disconnect your personal device from your home Wi-Fi because that’s very likely how she’s able to do these things. Get a new router and don’t allow her connect to it ever.

It’s on his bike route to and from school, so he would stop in after school just to see how many donuts were left at that time.

They closed at 11:00pm and were allowed to do this.  He would drop the bag of donuts on a cafeteria table, first come first serve or he would drop them in the teacher lounge.

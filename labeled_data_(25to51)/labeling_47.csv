I’m serious.

DM me, I’ll bake an amazing mangled cake but promise it’ll taste good!

I bet you’d make an impact on my kids and you don’t even realize how amazing and important you are. You’re here for a reason, let us join in on figuring things out together. 

Happy birthday my friend.

27104,m7t4by1,comment,,"Happy birthday! Just so you know, vitiligo is a very cool thing in the model industry. I’d consider even looking into it if I were you. I hope you consider staying and not ending your life, you are 28. 28 is a tough age because lifelong friends go down different paths, I’m friends w almost no one from that age now. It’s hard at the time but you realize later that it’s normal, happens to 95% of people. 

When you’re 18-30 you think you understand yourself because people around you are a reflection of you - when those reflections get too busy or have plans you feel there’s less of you around - but that is just not true, it’s just a new perspective that doesn’t feel too great at the time. When you’re 30-40 you truly learn to listen to yourself and you make yourself happy because people get busy so you have a closer and smaller friend circle.

I promise it gets way better, you just have to treat this part of your life as a phase you’re unfamiliar with.

Our brains change when we hit puberty, I honestly think our brains change again when we hit real adulthood. People don’t talk about it, which is the real issue. How you feel is how I felt and how many others have felt too. It’s ok to feel how you do, and let yourself be ok to feel that way too.

Enjoy today, treat yourself to something you love. You are worth it, today and every other day."," Happy birthday! Just so you know, vitiligo is a very cool thing in the model industry.

27106,m7t4ep9,comment,,"Happy Birthday from Colorado! 🥰 Don’t change who you are for others. If they bring you down, they aren’t meant to be in your life. Don’t make excuses for shitty people. It’s never your fault and you never deserve to be treated poorly. The ex that couldn’t be there for you and ran the opposite way when you needed her support, is a selfish person and doesn’t deserve you. Surround yourself only with people that lift you up, make you feel good about yourself, have something positive to offer you, or speak words of care and encouragement. The people who treat you poorly speak more about their own belief in their self worth and less about who you actually are. Embrace your difference, it was a gift from God and you just have to figure out how you can use your difference to help others. Maybe you were meant to change other’s views about the meaning of beauty, or maybe you were meant to become a positive role model and mentor for kids with the same condition struggling. If you believe in God, read the bible, pray, and ask God for his guidance. Joining a church helps heal the heart. Never accept or justify someone’s criticism of you, those people are better left in the hell they came from. You are so much better than they are. Ignore those people and make friends with those that see past your skin condition. The way someone treats you is the same way they treat others who aren’t exactly like them. We all have something we hate about ourselves, your skin condition does not define you, but your heart and the way you treat others do. Maybe you were meant to write your heartfelt post to reach those who felt the same way so they didn’t feel alone. You probably just saved thousands of lives.

27109,m7t4ji7,comment,,"Ummm... There's NO EFFING WAY in gonna let you waste Coldplay tickets, sir. Or yourself. You have so much life ahead of you there's no real way to get your brain around it. Not to say that it'll just be fucking sunshine and roses the rest of your days - I'm not the type to blow smoke up ANYBODY'S ass, especially an internet stranger who's genuinely going through some shit. I'm honestly truly so freaking sorry for the current hand you're being dealt, man. I am. And I can relate somewhat...(*Note: home of the following is intended in ANY way to compete with, make light of, or be at all dismissive of your journey. Not is it intended to come across like some kind of session from one of those terminally cheery fuckers that says shit like, "" tomorrow's always a brand new day to start over"" or "" it could always be worse"", or ""turn that frown upside down"", etc.)
Anyway, I digress (as I tend to quite a bit sorry bout the squirrels). I (45F) attempted suicide for the 1st time at 17. Not some lame ass cry for help or anything like that. I had GENUINELY gotten tired of living and could not handle the thought of even another DAY alive, let alone the while rest of my life. Anyway, at that point in my life I had like 1 friend that was honestly really not much more than an acquaintance in hindsight but this person at least noticed me and would talk to me or say hi if we met in passing. I was an extremely awkward, lonely child and teenager. (My I.Q. level is higher than average to the point of greatly hindering my ability to relate to my peers, thus effectively removing any sort of social interaction, friends, etc.) 
Back to my point : my attempted suicide got hijacked by an emergency room doctor. I had overdose and on pills and as I was waiting for them to take effect I fleetingly wondered if my only friend would wonder where I went. So I went to say goodbye and explain that I wasn't moving or sick of on vacation or missing, I was just dead and wanted to say goodbye and thanks for talking to me sometimes. They rightly freaked the fuck out at my nonchalant attitude toward my impending demise and even more so due to the self - imposed nature of said demise. So they called 911. I tried to explain calmly and sensibly to them and all medical personnel that it was ok I didn't want help I was just gonna go die now and I was truly honestly fine with not moving anymore or ever again (in fact, it was my dying wish). I was baffled by these people being so appalled at my choice and how they kept swearing something was wrong with me and trying to admit me to a psych unit. I didn't get why they wouldn't just let me go back home, plop down on my couch, and die and be done and not have to keep suffering and being crushingly lonely and trying to figure out "" the thing"" that was wrong with me that wouldn't let me have a friend or even a casual conversation with as stranger or acquaintance 99.9% of the time. I would've fixed it in a heartbeat if I knew what it was about me. ..... 
This shit is getting REALLY long -winded, sorry, OP and anybody else still hanging on at this point (I'd be shocked if there were honestly). 
Long story short, I met my first REAL friend in that psych unit. And the next few years of my life after that I wouldn't trade for the world. Then a bunch of bad shit happened and I was in a really dark place for about 16 years but I'm coming out the other end finally. (My stepdad killed my mom and kidnapped my daughter who was 5 at the time - I was 25. She's 25 now and I wouldn't even recognize her if I passed her on the street. The years between then and now have been good, bad, and in between. To be honest my life is pretty painful right now, actually. I'm going through some pretty heavy shit and not gonna lie I don't have an actual plan in place and an not actually suicidal, but I'd be totally fucking fine with getting hit by a bus right now. As long as I didn't live through it, that would suck. But the thing is this: the good times I've had in life so far have my my heart whole beyond measure. I've had belly laughs that originated in my soul with some of the best people you could ever meet. I've seen some astounding and beautiful things. And I know that things never stay bad forever. Likewise, all good things come to an end. And all I know is that the bad never has a chance to get better if in the good things that comes to an end.

I look forward to hearing from you, friend. ❤️",1,,2025-01-18 14:51,t3_1i3oqiz,,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1i3oqiz/todays_my_28_birthday_and_i_am_going_to_end_it/m7t4ji7/,Neutral

I felt like a failure, being unable to kill myself and I couldn't understand how I wasn't dying from all the pain I was feeling, it had to impossible.

27134,m7t6lqr,comment,,"I am sorry you feel that way, OP. Or at the very least has felt that way. The elation from the comments you received prior to mine must be wonderful!

But we live in a sort of dystopian world nowadays. One you normally would read in fiction where the main character starts the story with an observation of how *shitty* everything is and that it couldn't possibly get any worse.

High prices on commerce, price gouging, homes being gate-kept, rental surges, massive student loan debt, absolutely abominally terrible job market, minimum wage gatekeeping, and that it is increasingly more difficult to even start a family.

So in a way I can sympathize with the lack of response even to a birthday celebration. People have a TON on their minds and a state of overwhelming pressure, or even their own depression.

At the same time I think it shouldn't be an excuse to forget about another's birthday. Each year I feel as if less and less people celebrate my birthday.

Don't let it beat you up. Celebrate your day as evidence that you possibly are immortal with the continuing journey as proof. The world may not care, but now you know that there are people who do, can, and will care. We just need to get to know each other first.

High prices on commerce, price gouging, homes being gate-kept, rental surges, massive student loan debt, absolutely abominally terrible job market, minimum wage gatekeeping, and that it is increasingly more difficult to even start a family.

So in a way I can sympathize with the lack of response even to a birthday celebration. People have a TON on their minds and a state of overwhelming pressure, or even their own depression.

At the same time I think it shouldn't be an excuse to forget about another's birthday. Each year I feel as if less and less people celebrate my birthday.

Don't let it beat you up. Celebrate your day as evidence that you possibly are immortal with the continuing journey as proof. The world may not care, but now you know that there are people who do, can, and will care. We just need to get to know each other first.

Sending you some love and Happy birthday! 
When reading your story i can relate to it. But i caught myself before heading to far down the rabbit hole. 
But here’s some tips on what helped me. Cut out all toxic friends and family. Focus on your self for a bit and double down on what makes you happy. That might be a hobby something that you might have been thinking about trying or doing. 
Seek professional help to get to a better mindset and view of yourself. 
Reach out to your brother and have an honest discussion with him how you feel. He might be able to help you. 

In terms of career, Fuck that. Ive seen people that have had nothing in terms of money and they have been the happiest people ever because they associate value with. Seek other things that fulfill you! 

Start starting up for yourself, by accepting who you are! Then start small. When talking to colleagues and friends. Don’t be to agreeable. Example: If you want to go to a special place for lunch say so! 

Workout regularly is something that have helped me very much 

LAST TIP:
DELETE YOUR SOCIAL MEDIA: its all fake happiness! 

Look here at this post: there are 7,3k comments that are sending you love! Now go and enjoy the Coldplay concert you your new friends and appreciate the love in the world!

Happy Birthday from USA (colorado). Don’t change who you are for others. If they bring you down, they aren’t meant to be in your life. Don’t make excuses for bad people. It’s never your fault and you never deserve to be treated poorly. The girl that couldn’t be there for you and ran the opposite way when you needed her support, is a selfish person and doesn’t deserve you. Surround yourself only with people that lift you up, make you feel good about yourself, have something positive to offer you, or speak words of care and encouragement. The people who treat you poorly speak more about their own belief in their self worth and less about who you actually are. Embrace your difference, you can use it to help others. Maybe you were meant to change other’s views about the meaning of beauty, or maybe you were meant to become a positive role model and mentor for kids with the same condition who are struggling. Never accept or justify someone’s criticism of you, those people are better left in the mud they came from. You are so much better than they are. Ignore those people and make friends with those that see past your skin condition. The way someone treats you is the same way they treat others who aren’t exactly like them. We all have something we don’t like about ourselves, your skin condition does not define you, but your heart and the way you treat others do. Maybe you were meant to write your heartfelt post to reach those who felt the same way so they didn’t feel alone. You probably just saved thousands of lives. You are a beautiful person, you just have to look in the mirror and realize it. And obviouslv from the thousands of us that responded. you are loved.

One of my closest friends thought this. He thought no one cared about him. He went down a dark path that had his mind twisted, thinking that he couldn't trust me or anyone. He isolated himself constantly, and went from one of the happiest and goofiest dudes I've ever known to a complete husk of a human.

On the day of his funeral, there were so many cars in the graveyard people were causing traffic on the streets around just to try to find a place to park. It felt like a hundred people were there, classmates, friends, family. Even the priest made a comment saying he didn't know the last time there were so many people there to pay their respects to someone. I was 20, and I remember how quiet it was with all those people there, so quiet I could hear the ropes stretching as he was lowered. 

Over 15 years later and I still hear those ropes. 

Your mind is sick and you need to see a professional who deals with a sick mind. It's hurting and clouded by a powerfully addictive drug called Negativity. You think no one cares about you know, but you don't know what pain you'll be giving those that do if you go the easy way out. Look at your brother and imagine him screaming alone ag night at the top of his lungs until his voice cracks and his face hurts. Look at your friend and imagine him sitting in his bedroom years from now, tears streaming down and wondering if he's just permanently fucked up now. Imagine seeing the absence of life in your father's eyes as automatic motor functions have taken over and left nothing but emptiness. I used to have dreams about him in a cold silent night, slowly swinging back and forth on the tree. ""What if I did it. What if I hurt him and made him do it. It's my fault. I pushed him to it. I got mad at him for X reason or Y reason. I did it. He died bc of me."" Those are thoughts that haunted me and many others for years and years.

Don't do it. If you're really a good person, then make God watch your suffering until the bitter end. That thought right there has gotten me through so much hard shit including what i went through here. Suffer through it. Grind your teeth and get mad at the world. Do whatever it takes to keep you opening those eyes and breathing life. I wouldn't wish the pain I went through on even my most hated people. I still think about him from time to time, what he might think of a song I hear, what he would say about a movie I watched, remembering his goody ass walking down the hallways towering over everyone (he was I think 6'8) his mop of a haircut bouncing and people following him and laughing.

 I still hear his goofy laugh. I still hear those fucking ropes."," 7k comments. Idk if you'll read this little one from me op, but if you do...

I’m the opposite and I freaking hate my birthday and hope people forget. I only remember my immediate family’s B day but I’m a guy, so although it’s not an excuse it’s kinda of accepted. I  have a wife to remember for me. People have changed in the last 20 years about being more self centered so they put less effort into remembering ‘friends’ birthdays and other things. Hang in there, I know it’s easy for me to say but get some confidence and you’ll get some real friends eventually. Just try your best not to be needy or annoying.

27180,m7umfxt,comment,,"A lot of assumptions here... Suicide is selfish. Assuming it wont affect anyone cuz you assume nobody cares??? I got news for you.. Birthdays by your age become less important. Its another day. I just had a birthday and forgot til halfway thru the day. No cake no presents etc. I'm a few years older than you.

life is hard man. You can wallow in self pity, or you can man up. If you need other ppl to find your own happiness, you are your own worst enemy. Other people sense your self pity. Your lack of confidence. Im not trying to be mean, just giving you tough love.

I had a 4 person concert situation similar to yours and i said fuck it and drove 5 hours through a record breaking thanksgiving blizzard and saw that show by myself. I was sad but I realized I am most important to myself, and others will only ever bring a shade of color to your life whereas you and only you can bring the whole palette.

 I'll tell you what worked for me. Self reaffirmation. Look in the mirror every morning. Tell yourself you are important. Say, ""I will have a great day. I'm gonna do great at work, and when im done im gonna take myself on a date. Im gonna go to my favorite restaurant and eat my favorite food."" or maybe you want to do somethin else, like ""I will go fishing, and learn how to prep and eat it myself."" or,  ""I will go get helium balloons, and draw all my sorrows on each one, and let them go one at a time outside and feel that weight lift off my shoulders.""

Do whatever you feel like in the moment, if it causes you happiness. Don't tell yourself no. Go on Facebook events, click on the first one you see and go. Even if you dont like how it sounds. My fave advice to give solo adventurers is get a motorcycle, or at least a moped. It is the single greatest solo adventure tool of all time. Hop on at a whim, just you and the wind, sights, smells for as long as you hold that throttle. Drive 6 hours in a random direction just cuz you can. Your confidence gained from learning your own zen will attract people to you. All of a sudden you will find yourself going to work happily. Laying in bed not wondering if ppl like you or forgot you, but instead wondering what tomorrow's adventure will bring, and in awe of todays adventure as you drift to sleep. Drink less. Say yes to every. single. invite. Tell yourself you are handsome and that your success is inevitable. Maybe microdose some mushrooms. By this time next year you will be astounded at your own growth.

good luck and happy birthday."," A lot of assumptions here... Suicide is selfish. Assuming it wont affect anyone cuz you assume nobody cares??? I got news for you..

Hop on at a whim, just you and the wind, sights, smells for as long as you hold that throttle. Drive 6 hours in a random direction just cuz you can. Your confidence gained from learning your own zen will attract people to you. All of a sudden you will find yourself going to work happily. Laying in bed not wondering if ppl like you or forgot you, but instead wondering what tomorrow's adventure will bring, and in awe of todays adventure as you drift to sleep. Drink less. Say yes to every. single. invite. Tell yourself you are handsome and that your success is inevitable. Maybe microdose some mushrooms. By this time next year you will be astounded at your own growth.

good luck and happy birthday.",1,,2025-01-18 19:25,t3_1i3oqiz,,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1i3oqiz/todays_my_28_birthday_and_i_am_going_to_end_it/m7umfxt/,Neutral
27181,m7unll6,comment,,"Wow. This is just amazing. I love how i am scanning through these comments right now and not able to find even one negative or unkind comment. This is really moving. 

OP, Happy Birthday. Seriously dude. Birthdays are important. I know what it's like to get so excited for your own birthday and put so much meaning in it to make it special, not just for you but for the ones you want to share it with you. I am so happy to see the moving experience that had taken place shortly after you posted. 

It took alot for you to come online and open up to the possibilities of the world. That is strength. To take the chance with what often seems to be the big cruel harsh reality around us existing within humanity. 

Quite often it seems the experience is mostly bad but I think this is deception talking to us when we are at our worst, feeling no right way to turn, or rather cornered by hurtful experiences, trauma, heartache, stress, fatigue, no love, the attachments that have become the glue that hold us together in the place of love, nuture, reassurance, empathy, understanding, compassion, protection and all our natural born hearts as they were formed in the womb desire. 


I chose to believe that the world or humanity, most of the people you will meet, opportunities that come your way, some may term it luck - is actually mostly good. Its quite worth the gamble my long list little brother. (I'm 29 going on 30 lol). 

I was supposed to send this last night, maybe 9hrs after you posted. I fell asleep while positing. Now I see reddit has taken down your post? Why?! This was so moving to see the strength and confidence you had to use sharing with us, and all the positive comments, friendship and good vibes being sent your way. I cried multiple times reading comments and more. Happy tears mostly and just heart being overwhelmed. 


I've fought the battle with suicidal ideation or fantasizations myself. Still comes up for me but I also 100% want to he here for what happens next. I have to much FOMO to miss out on life. Hahaha. Although, those snow Banks start looking really comfy and warm at times. The cliffs seem inviting. The walls seem soft and transparent like you could just walk through em and never stop walking... I think there is nothing wrong with us admitting this and sharing it with one another to know we are not alone. 

To kill the stigma surrounding mental health and normalize that we are not always all happy go lucky. We have permission to be sad, to hurt, feel pain, loneliness and feel disconnected or off sometimes. We also have permission and the right to feel happy, rewarded, fulfilled, supported/backed up, lucky, and successful. There is much to look forward to, especially when you can find joy in the littlest of things. ❤️


There is more I've wanted to say here but my brain ball is tapped out right now. Hell it was when I started writting early early this morning before I passed out. I couldn't deny or look the other way when I saw the notification for your post in my email/preview to what you shared. 

Love you man. We all love all, some just hurt too much or too broken for the feelings to come easy. (No one is ""too broken"" for fixing - remember the broken Chinese vases/pots that the cracks are filled with gold?) Long distant cousins and family we all are - yeah I believe that. It's okay, we can be distant enough that we can also share love, intimacy, affection and pleasure with one another as well. Hahaha. Had to throw a funny in there. 


Thank you all for your demonstration of open kindness (was supposed to say open-mindedness, but hey that works too), positive vibes, love and support, affection, reassurance and more. Compassion is 🔑.  

Peace, love & success.

27185,m7v34dc,comment,,"I can't find my original comment. Some people don't know how to validate, acknowledge or provide reassurance. 

Sometimes we need the people who make us want to prove them wrong or show them better and make us reflect on how we can improve, grow and change for the better. 

Yes it is also important to do some self reflection and take a deep dark look inside yourself. I have a friend, well, he's actually become less on my list now due to his actions and choices and wanting to bring others down with him - 

Who constantly buys multiple tickets to a concert or show thinking others will join him. He doesn't work, he's on the system, disability, etc. A drug addict who can't stay clean for more than 7mo. (I've been in recovery for over 7 Yrs I get it ok). 

But he just buys the tickets and then expects us to all be able to go with him or to want to go. Yet we are working people, construction workers, get tired and want to rest in weekends and don't always feel like attending said concert even if we had the time to actually do so. 

But it's been annoying with him in the past cause he expects us to just simply take the day off, go to the concert with me, ticket has been paid - don't go to work the next day. Don't be tired or want to stay at home. It's a touchy or strange predicament to be in. We've said to him ""bro why wouldn't you have asked before you purchased the tickets to find someone to go with who had confirmed their availability and desire to go"". 

Even then though, you can't always expect if you ask someone months before hand, that they could guarantee their availability or feeling like going that much ahresd of time. We don't always know what can happened. Too many of us get to overwhelmed or overstimulated in life that we just need to shut off for a bit and hide from the outside. So you can't blame others for needing to do what they need to do. 


I still feel for you though. Just a relative experience. You also have to think, have you given reason for friends people coworkers to have a hard time connecting with you or getting to close? For example, this friend I am referring to, he has been such a shit disturber! He gossips about other people's problems told to him in confidence, he literally seems to try and drive wedges between other relationships or friendships. It's like he wants to focus on him so puts efforts into tearing the circle apart so they don't all find out the common problem here. 


He also has no responsibility or accountability for his own actions and the things he's done wrong. Doesn't understand why all there things would throw a bone between the friendships or feel unsafe to be around. This guy did drugs in my living environment when I'm in my 8th running year of recovery- didn't give a fuck. Would have been happy if I relapsed and ended up on his level. Would have been happy if all the damage he tried to do by going back and forth with ""he said she said"" bullshit between my bf and I. 

So... it's touchy. Cause if it was this person I am referring to sharing what OP did, I don't know what I would think. I would be telling him to pull his big boy panties up, get a life and maybe if he didn't try to break everyone else down around him or had common courtesy and respect, he would have a different experience. 

(We have this guy- a best friend of over 10 years - a place to stay and try to recover and all 3 different times in the past year. Everytme after 2 weeks at most he would mess it up - do drugs in the home, lie about it, lie to our face and make us think we are stupid, meanwhile I'd been there done that so I  knew all along - gas lighting/crazy making? - yup.) 

So it's not like we weren't there or didn't try to be. Tried to give him a life worth living, tried to help him be better, got on the right track, save money to get himself into a nice place on his own where he could have been independant and not living with his 80y.o mommy anymore at 32y.o... 

But he squandered it just as he has literally squandered everything. He uses the system, takes our tax dollars to use drugs in other peoples homes, literally finds joy in homewrecking by causing break ups and turmoil. 

I think people got the picture. I had just done some reflection thinking, what if this was C-nor who posted this after everything we'd been through with him feeling like a loner and failure meanwhile, did it to himself. 

Yes, we all deserve compassion and chances, but if we don't provide that to ourselves and keep putting one foot ahead of the other, how can we expect to get forward? 


OP, Therapy does help by the way. If you can; social worker/case manager or worker - one that can come to your home or take you out for lunch and help you literally explore to bring your life to where you want it. Meet your goals. They do exist. I have one right now. A social worker that is mobile, also I've had a case manager who would step into my life and meet me where I was at, too. 

Group therapy: CBT, DBT, CPT. Dialetics is very important. They we think inside is one thing, our cognitive behaviour patterns etc. AND dialectics is about what we say, the dialect we have with ourselves and others. It helped me alot and I'll probably take em again and again. Life long work bro. 100%. You'll never stop getting better, learning and changing for the better. Help is immortal I guess. 

Also, psychiatrist can help with diagnosis and medication/prescription drugs. That doesn't really dive in deep and help the route problems though.

Psychologists, psychotherapists and those that are usually not covered by public health coverage or benefits but private, is where it is at. It is really life changing. Going on and off of pysch. Meds don't really help. They can help short term in providing some relief, give you the push to get to the other side of the road persay persay, 

But long term, you want to dive into some deep work. You want therapists or facilitators who give you homework. Are gentle but the right amount of push or being hard on you when you need it. Especially once they know more of your personality and behaviour and where you could adjust to even it out. 

Self awareness is so important and useful in seeking help, growth and positive change. It's also important to have self compassion, self appreciation, and to improve your self-talk. It all begins or is rooted in your SELF.

27224,1i5s3oc,post,"Getting kicked out of the house by my parents, the best thing that hapened.","Hi All,

It all started when i was born. My parents wanted a girl and in our country, the child's sex can't be disclosed and the moment i was born, my parents were taken aback and were extremely disappointed ( my parents themselves have told me this along with my other relatives) plus i was born a bit deformed. Maybe they have a reason to hate me.

2 years later, my sister was born and man, she was treated like royalty and has never got scolded or shouted at in her life.

I used to get mentally and physically abused by my parents, physical including getting hit with a belt, asking me to squat 100 times, or sitting like a chair without taking support of the wall, hands raised. I used to be an average student with lots of fear and insecurities. My father used to hate me so much that any small thing or a complaint against me would result in any of the punishment i mentioned above. For serious punishment, i was stripped naked and pushed outside my house, (had pubes growing out just then).

My grandpa saved me that day and had never repeated again.

This continued as i grew up, i was the dreamwrecker, the unfit child, the misfit.

Fast forward to present day, i got married to the girl whom my parents sought out, post our marriage, my parents started to mentally abuse my wife when i was at work and they wanted to give us hell so that we leave the house.

I was a child who has not experienced a father's love or a mother's warmth. I got the love from my inlaws who are no more with me.

After 18 months of hell, my wife finally gave up and told me everything. I was so upset, i felt i made a huge mistake by getting married and spoiling the poor girl's life. I had to do something, the next day, for the first time, i went to my parents and said i want to leave the house, i didn't mention any reason specifically. To my surprise, they said they are happy with my decision and asked us to vacate.

Before all this, now that i remember, 2 months into our marriage, my parents asked us to get out of the house because of some silly conversation.

I'm out of that hell, I'm struggling financially, which I'm sure the universe will sort it out and also, my wife is finally feeling healthy and happy. 

I'm crying inside as I'm typing this.

Don't neglect your kids especially if they are born deformed like me or have any problems, don't give your kids negative punishment or physical and mental abuse. Just treat your kids with love and compassion and the universe will look after you when you are old.","Getting kicked out of the house by my parents, the best thing that hapened. Hi All,

It all started when i was born. My parents wanted a girl and in our country, the child's sex can't be disclosed and the moment i was born, my parents were taken aback and were extremely disappointed ( my parents themselves have told me this along with my other relatives) plus i was born a bit deformed. Maybe they have a reason to hate me.

2 years later, my sister was born and man, she was treated like royalty and has never got scolded or shouted at in her life.

I used to get mentally and physically abused by my parents, physical including getting hit with a belt, asking me to squat 100 times, or sitting like a chair without taking support of the wall, hands raised. I used to be an average student with lots of fear and insecurities. My father used to hate me so much that any small thing or a complaint against me would result in any of the punishment i mentioned above. For serious punishment, i was stripped naked and pushed outside my house, (had pubes growing out just then).

My grandpa saved me that day and had never repeated again.

This continued as i grew up, i was the dreamwrecker, the unfit child, the misfit.

Fast forward to present day, i got married to the girl whom my parents sought out, post our marriage, my parents started to mentally abuse my wife when i was at work and they wanted to give us hell so that we leave the house.

I was a child who has not experienced a father's love or a mother's warmth. I got the love from my inlaws who are no more with me.

The torture for my wife got so bad, that she lost weight, became frail, but did not tell me what my parents did behind my back. After 18 months of hell, my wife finally gave up and told me everything. I was so upset, i felt i made a huge mistake by getting married and spoiling the poor girl's life.

I mean as soon as i turned 18 I had sex with someone who was 30. Then 34. Then 35, Then 38. 42. 53. I put myself in a really scary and uncomfortable situation with that last one and since then I've felt sick to my stomach when i think about it. It hasnt stopped me from pursuing older men but it definitely put a cap on the age range because, FUCK there are some pedophiles out there. My age limit is like 30 now and I currently have a fwb who is 29. But I feel like im doing something wrong constantly :(.

27291,1i5tdjf,post,Together we can move mountains Stained’s glass can be a powerful tool for recovery ,"Title: Together, We Can Make a Difference: A Call for Compassion and Action

In a world that often feels increasingly lost, it’s easy to become overwhelmed by the heartbreaking truth that so many cries for help go unanswered. Each day, countless individuals struggle silently, feeling invisible as they face their hardships alone. It truly pains me to witness the suffering around us—people in desperate need, yet our collective response can sometimes feel inadequate. But I believe that, with the grace of God, we can change this narrative.

My name is Aaron Orth, and I refuse to sit idly by while those around us endure their struggles in silence. Inspired by the teachings of compassion and love, I’ve taken a step forward by starting a GoFundMe campaign aimed at extending a helping hand to those who need it most. The individuals we’re talking about are not just numbers or statistics; they are real people—mothers, fathers, and children—whose lives hang in the balance while the world often turns a blind eye to their pain.

In these challenging times, let us remember the profound power of compassion and community. Even the smallest acts of kindness can create waves of change in someone’s life. A single dollar, a shared message, or a simple word of encouragement can mean the world to someone who feels lost and alone. Together, we have the potential to be part of something greater—a movement of hope, healing, and faith for those who are suffering.

If you find yourself unable to donate at this time, that’s completely understandable. What truly matters is that we raise awareness and spread this message far and wide. Please consider sharing this post; you never know who might be touched by it and inspired to help. In a time when the world can feel so dark, let’s be the light that guides others toward healing.

Let’s unite in this effort to shine a light in the darkness. Together, we have the ability to answer the urgent cries for help and restore faith in humanity. It’s time to take action and show those in need that they are not alone, that they are seen, and that they are loved. With the grace of God, we can turn our compassion into action.

Thank you for taking the time to read this message. If you feel moved to contribute, I invite you to join me in this important cause.

Just so I don’t blow up your inbox, feel free to message me. 

Vitiligo isn’t something you can control, but some kids and adults are mean and stupid. 

With friends, sometimes they’re simply unable to make events. If my closer friends buy concert tickets, we all agree to pay each other immediately, and if someone is unable to go, we try to sell the ticket to recoup that friend’s cost. If I see that a friend flakes out on events consistently, I simply keep that friend outside my closer circles. With friends who attempt to hang out, I try to make more of an effort.

I just turned 42 ten days ago. Trust me: you’re young, but with time, life gets better. You will make new friends, and your life can improve. Find a few hobbies and subjects that you’re interested in. Grow in those areas (you don’t have to be an expert, but it should be for your enjoyment). Grow at work. Try taking on new tasks if possible. These things will make it easier for strangers to click with you.

Success: it can come in waves. You may feel less successful than those around you, but there are people who care about you—sometimes more than you realize. I have been jobless recently, but people seem to appreciate that I listen to them. And from the outpouring of support, I think people really do care about you.

27320,m86hunw,comment,,"I think the better question is why they are interested in you. Don't take this the wrong way, because it's not really about you, but a man who is 30 years old shouldn't be looking at barely legal girls or boys for sex or romance. No matter how many times you hear ""Age is just a number"", do remember that you're not grown up at 18. And you won't be grown up for another few years. They are taking advantage of that, and they're going after way too young people for a reason.

People, usually men over thirty who are into young girls, will say we're too hung up on age, but the reality is that it is a problem. It can go well, and maybe not everyone has bad intentions, but it's such a fine line between a normal healthy hookup and a dangerous situation (physically or mentally). They can, do and will take advantage of you, and most of the time you don't even realise it until it's too late. I'm speaking from experience.

I think it's a good idea for you to have stricter age limits like you mentioned, and maybe also just try to avoid it altogether. I know people your own age can feel immature or annoying (Again, from experience. I've been there), but there are plenty of guys your own age or just a few years older that are more on your wavelength.

Try not to beat yourself up over it too much though. It's a natural thing to feel attracted to people older than yourself, I would be far more shameful if I was a 40 year old who slept with an 18 year old."," I think the better question is why they are interested in you.

27345,m86ngms,comment,,"So, as someone who actually had the same problems, I can share what would've helped me to start an art career earlier along the way.

I understand that you've bought the kid all the supplies they could possibly need, but that doesn't mean that they'll feel enthusiastic to use it. They need to see that it's fun first. They probably don't even know how to use it, and feel owerwhelmed by them. You can help them get through this by showing that you like it as well. I feel like if you really think it's important for them to leave AI art, the only way is to become interested yourself, and sit down with them to create together!

This is also neccessary, because when someone has an idea, they tend to use techniques they know, because they can already imagine how they'll be applying it with their knowledge at hand. So if they got into a particular area of art, or even just seen someone use the technique alongside them, and like the results, they'll want to try it as well. When they get comfortable in using it, and seen some results, they'll be comfortable enough to express their ideas through it. 

This is what I'm literally doing in art college rn. Even the teachers are usually looking up the techniques right alongside us learning it, and all we do is try out different techniques. Like i could literally pick everything up by myself through the internet, it's only worth it because it's faster with a teacher doing research with us on the techniques, as their job.
So what I think would really help the kid for now, is seeing which area they like, the LEGOs or the 3d pens, or painting, and then just do drills with them, like build something cool, either easy or complicated you find on the internet with a tutorial, but be there with them, and keep their morals up if it doesn't work quite the way you'd expect.

Also, after you have a technique they like, and got used to, you should focus on how to use the internet ALONGSIDE art work. At art college, we use it daily, you can see some pretty awesome ideas on Pinterest. Look up ideas before a project, make sure not to copy anything, when it's about your own art, and then you're ready to create!"," So, as someone who actually had the same problems, I can share what would've helped me to start an art career earlier along the way.

All I can offer is the knowledge that you are enough.  You like Coldplay.  You bought tickets to the concert.  You care about yourself enough for you to want yourself to have fun. So lean into that. People are tough. You can give them all the love you can and if they don’t want to they can’t reciprocate back. But you can reciprocate it back to yourself. Your hobbies can reciprocate it back to you. Make your focus about you satisfying yourself. Thats it. Don’t worry about doing anything for anyone else. Before anything you do ask “how does this affect me? Am I going to get gratification out of doing this?”  Then just let the people fall in line where they do. You can be enough for yourself.

I feel like this fits your recommendation you gave me, so I feel like I'm lacking in execution here; we're on a week on week off basis with their biodad; and we don't want to overwhelm them with art if they don't feel like it (which is why we said okay at least something artsy thats non-tech).

1. Happy birthday! I'm glad you found a tribe to celebrate with you. 

2. When your friends desert you and you really want to go to an event, GO ALONE! You're going somewhere with a built-in tribe, you're all there because of a shared interest, that's the BEST and EASIEST way to make friends and strike up conversations. 

My personal turning point was about a year ago where I had tickets to a Drum n Bass rave I really had been looking forward to and, for various reasons, everyone I was supposed to go with bailed. My instinct was to sell my ticket and forget about it, but as the night approached I found myself really resenting that decision, so I kept my ticket, went alone, and HAD THE BEST TIME EVER making dance floor buddies and enjoying some of my favourite DJs. Since then, I have gone solo a bunch of times, and I have always ended up meeting new people, and having a blast. 

The lesson is, don't let anyone else be the reason you miss out on lifes' experiences. You'll never regret doing what you enjoy, even if sometimes you do it alone."," Late to the thread. OP, but I wanted to say two things:

27537,m87ptyy,comment,,"I get where you are coming from, and I can understand how you feel, but you also need to come to terms with the fact that those feelings are conditional for others.

For example, if you mistreat the kid mom will probably stop considering you a parent. If you upset the kid enough he can just decide not to see you that way. I know because I lived it.

However as a stepdad you do have a special power: passive example.

His mom picked you AFTER dad for some kind of reason and the kid knows this. Whatever the reason may be he knows you can't be bad. Or not that bad (unless of course you create friction with his biodad, or do something to make the kid lose trust in you). This means that the things you do around the kid as examples will often absorb better than direct interactions. Direct interactions about this subject may feel like you are opposing his biodad and that wont work.

For example; actively making a piece of art that cannot be created by AI illustrates the limitations to 2d art. Sculptures for example cannot be made by AI. Even if a 3d model is generated it cannot be produced without a human hand.

Another good way to do this is by creating 2d artwork that cannot be reproduced by Ai. There are a lot of examples of this. All you have to do is manually create something and then show that AI can't copy it. Maybe he walks in the room as you happen to be trying to recreate your own artwork with AI. Maybe you ask for his help and he sees for himself that human work can't easily be recreated.

Chatgpt is my friend? Well if that's true, then proving that it's not actually conscious or that it isn't ""nice"" might be helpful. For example, chatgpt often can hallucinate false information, and recent studies of the 6 largest LLMs reveal consistent machiavellian behavior. This is a bit more difficult to explain to a 9 year old but definitely possible. Again, not directly but maybe mention a big oopsie that AI caused at work, or maybe he sees you listening to stories of people losing their jobs to ai models trained on their own work.

Showing these limitations and issues without making it an active point of conversation may have a bigger impact as the kid will see you actively creating, then go to dads house and eventually see the difference in action. Seeing you happy by creating with your hands, and then seeing dad simply content with AI will send him some strong signals. It won't happen overnight but it will happen. And if it doesn't it probably wasn't going to.

Best of luck."," I get where you are coming from, and I can understand how you feel, but you also need to come to terms with the fact that those feelings are conditional for others.

27565,1i5zkfu,post,I’m a horrible person that has made horrible mistakes.,"I started gambling in April 2024. What started out as a rainy day download of an online casino, has now taken over my life. It was great at first as my first day I went over $3000. I would play casually, and it seemed my gambling was not a problem. Fast forward, to September 2024. I took out a parent plus loans in the amount of $87,000 for my daughter two years prior to attend the college of her dreams in New York City. She started out doing fantastic. She moved into a dorm and made tons of friends. She informed me that she was doing wonderful in school. Her second semester was just as great and she was still informing me that her grades were above average and I believed her. Then came time for her to start her third semester. That day she tried to access her student email and confirm her schedule for her first day back. She called me informing me that she was locked out of her email and I suggested she called her school. She did. she then said her counselor informed her that she was suspended from school and definitely. We then called together. Her counselor stated it would do your daughter, a dis justice to continue her college career as she did not maintain her GPA. Come to find out that her second semester. She decided to party every night and not do her work. She tried to make it up without saying anything to me, and was unable to maintain her average at that point the only thing I could do was gamble to see if I could pay off that debt. As of today, I am facing eviction, and my car will be repossessed I have borrowed money from everyone I knew, just to gamble. I have pleaded with my daughter to enroll in school so I wouldn’t have to pay the loans off right away. She is refusing. I begged her to make it right. She’s refusing. I’ve hurt my family, my friends, and everyone that is close to me, due to my gambling addiction. I’ve contemplated suicide, because I don’t know how to get myself out of this hole. I’m tired of hurting myself and hurting others. I’ve lent money to countless people and have asked for repayment and every single person that I’ve lent money to will not repay me. Just want this pain to end. I’m praying for a miracle, but my prayers are not being answered. My faith is now nonexistent. Asking for prayers to be sent my way. 
*Im not looking for sympathy just prayers and positive vibes. I feel horrible about my addiction! As far as my daughter goes, when I asked her the other day for a sit down to discuss a game plan, she couldn’t talk because she was on vacation with her friend in Nashville! I am losing my home and she thought it was fine to go on VACATION! I’m angry, I’m sad, and I have every right to be! ","I’m a horrible person that has made horrible mistakes.

Try planning something WITH them so everyine wants to go. Personally i wouldnt enjoy a Coldplay concert, let alone want to spend hundreds of dollars on something i dont want to attend. I know that sounds mean but its the truth. But if my friend reached out and asked, “hey what can we do this weekend?” Or “lets plan a hangout night?” Id be much more open.",1,,2025-01-20 20:21,t3_1i3oqiz,,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1i3oqiz/todays_my_28_birthday_and_i_am_going_to_end_it/m880q6u/,Neutral

27639,1i60weg,post,I Took 50mg off of 5 ritalin pills at once. Nearing madness.,"A long time ago, i took 45mg a day. No effect except slightly faster heartbeat out of daily anticipation. FYI, I was diagnosed twice. Stopped the medication route then.

A month for exam prep, frozen. Pre exam day, frozen. Pre exam night i stayed awake, hoping the rare normality kicks in, frozen, remembered no info, failed. 

No challenging info. I dare say, with no adhd, i would finish anything less not at phd level revising 30min a day and weekend mornings.

Slept midday today. Despite having a careful persona, i committed the worst simple action of my life. 

I took 5 ritalin pills off what i had left from months ago, 50mg at once. In my life, i have never actively committed an action so crystal clear to end in tragedy and regret.

only legal med and at an extreme dose:

 Nothing, zero. No positive, no negative. 

 Im tired, boss

I made sure i had no other options to escape poverty by impulsively isolating off of the slightest interpersonal conflict. Stunted socially and stunted in discipline. My life companion is doom scrolling. 

The one thing im good at, academics, i can't even demonstrate and produce results. 

I won't off myself sober, and i can't afford nor would take enough drugs to intend and commit a mistake so effortful and painful. I dont want to kms, i dont want to lose, they win. 

I just want someone to witness my thoughts because im intrigued about taking the full 80mg day dose at once or a tablet or one box. Illogical. I wont, i just need somebody to witness my thoughts. I'm genuinely considering a merciful end if i get to my 30s at this status.

Genuinely dont know if im happy or sad i can't abuse medication.","I Took 50mg off of 5 ritalin pills at once. Nearing madness. A long time ago, i took 45mg a day. No effect except slightly faster heartbeat out of daily anticipation. FYI, I was diagnosed twice. Stopped the medication route then.

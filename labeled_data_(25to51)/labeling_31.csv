18190,1i6akz2,post,Another story in the sea of many unfortunately ,"This is going to be long don’t feel obligated to read it. I just need to vent and get some advice or know if it’s normal. Three years ago, I was raped by my boyfriend at a house party. I’m not sure if I drank too much or if I was roofied, but it is pretty blurry. I remember a portion of the assault and that in itself is traumatic enough for me. It’s really hard coming back from that however I don’t remember the rest of the evening. I can remember up until a certain point so the unknown is also freaking terrifying. It was really really really hard to get through that and learn how to move on with my life after something like that happens. I did everything to cope between substances and alcohol and even therapy. My therapist ended up, forcing me to tell my mother and also called the police Because I was still a minor and for some reason she had the ability to do so. My parents ended up, blaming me because I was drinking. I don’t really want to get into that, but that’s their opinion. Not too long after that I met my husband And he’s been great and we don’t really talk about it but when we do, he’s very supportive and has my back. But recently when we argue he’s becoming a violent putting his hands on me pushing me into walls and makes me feel very scared and now it’s like all of a sudden I’m going through all that stuff that happened when I was 16 again. Becoming hypersexual, but also disgusted and scared and depressed at the same time. Is this normal to go through this late I don’t even know why I’m typing on here. I just I’m feeling like I’m going crazy. Please help me. I’m getting nightmares and flashbacks again. It’s taken so long to come this far. I’m just scared it going to take me that long again. Every time I think about it it feels like a heart attack. I feel like someone has to relate. 

Edit
I fear for my life often. You wouldn’t believe the bruising he left behind. I don’t know what he did. But he is still out there and could come finish the job any day.

18200,1i6c542,post,"My stepdad raped me when I was little, and to the day I still feel disgusting (VENT)","When I was little, I'm not sure how old, my stepfather raped me at my old house, in the bathroom. He told me it was game, and that he needed it, and that I couldn't tell anyone else, no matter the situation. So, little me complied to what he wanted- I did what he wanted, and I didn't tell anyone. He manipluated me into having sex with him, and made me hide it. I was groomed. (before he had slowly been building a relationship with me. Buying gifts, visited me at school once, was super kind, etcetc  
) 

After that, I had dreams about it for around a year, as little me thought it'd been a good thing, so I dreams about it after, which ""made sense"" to me, so I didnt tell anyone. Years and years passed, years pass where i'm able to report him to get him in trouble. (the 5+ years rule my mom has told me about + If I even wanted to report him, I have zero proof.)

  
And recently, I've been feeling like a disgusting person. I feel like I was so naive as a kid- why did I believe him so *easily,* that it was an okay thing for him to do? Why didn't I SPEAK UP? If only I'd been smart enough to know it was wrong- I could've gotten help for it. Now it'll always be justive left unserved, my body left unavenged.

My body feels gross, my mouth feels gross. I feel gross, I can still imagine how it felt, what he did to me, I still feel like I'm tainted by his touch, and it disgusts me. I hate my body, I hate how gross I feel. The boys at my school catcall me, follow me moaning, etc- they touch my shoulders, one even spanked me once with a ruler.

I became hypersexual and he groomed me to initiate things based on his cues

18231,1hrgcsr,post,the hate ive felt towards women weighs heavy on my heart.,"Let's be honest; there are glaring issues with women in Western culture. We all know women included, that modern women's behavior is less than savory. I don't need to pad that statement with (not all women) as I believe we can all be mature enough to understand that's implied. 

Ladies, you all know what I mean: toxicity, fakeness, hyper-competitive nature, ego drive, narcissism, ""all my friends are men cause women to suck"" (we've all heard women utter this countless times), etc. I could point the finger at men, too, but we disproportionately hold men way more accountable as a society. Hence, I never felt the need to fixate on them because it's already overdone, and that's why I've been so vocal and aggressive at throwing hate toward women indiscriminately, partially because of the excessive pushback and deflective, dismissive, reductionist, blame-shifting nature of the response I've received from my criticisms. The hate I've endured has magnified and amplified my frustrations, which turned to bitterness and resentment, which naturally leads to hatred, but that's not me. I've watched myself allow the toxicity to turn me into a worse person, and it permeates into the minds and hearts of the men around me. My words have harmed others, and I feel incredibly guilty. I went from trying to approach my grievances with compassion and tenderness, especially in spaces like Reddit when I'm met with not only pushback but mockery, to abject hatred. It's soaked into my soul, and I allowed it to set the tone of my future approaches, full of malice, anger, and hatred, partially to anticipate the kind of pushback I've become accustomed to. 

I still stand by my criticisms about women because it does need attention and reflection, but I'm letting go of the anger, rage, and hate. I'm tired of hurting others because I've been hurt by such a large volume of people who never walked in my shoes to understand my point of view, and I don't think that should be a one-sided effort. I know others' perspectives if given a genuine chance to connect and talk about sensitive and emotionally charged issues to balance the scales of perspective. Hence, we come to this growing cultural divide between the sexes.

But rather than meeting down the middle and finding perspective, I always have to defend my grievances, experiences, etc., while the other tries to push their narrative. It's taxing on the mind when I only want resolution, peace, happiness, and fulfillment. I don't think that's too much to ask for, but some people want to see the world burn, and for a brief moment, I became the very thing I stood against, acting as a mirror, but it hasn't accomplished anything but pushed people away and made me deeply regretful. 

I'm sorry. How can we communicate more effectively? Maybe I lack the tools to convey this in a way that doesn't offend people; maybe what I have to say offends people no matter how I approach it, but I think we all can do better, myself included. Can we stop the fighting? Can we put down our shields? Can we lead with our higher thought process despite the conflicting emotions so there's a chance of resolving our own inner turmoil?  If not for the world but for your sanity? I like to think even the most bitter person deep down wants something they feel too helpless to achieve on their own, and in this case, of social friction, we need each other. I don't think this is something we can overcome as individuals because there's a breakdown on a communal level.

The hate projected onto me, and the projector is a disservice; how things ripple through the entire medium of life constantly circles back to the projector, amplifying their disposition, like myself. Sometimes, it takes standing at the edge of the abyss to know one more step, and you could be swallowed whole by darkness, and we ALL deserve love and harmony. 

What is your take on this? Please be respectful and intentional with your responses. I would like this to be a positive conversation. I know plenty of jokesters out there may be apathetic to my heartfelt message, and I will not entertain that energy because I'm desperately trying to preserve the last bit of hope and good in me—Thank you to those who've read this far.","the hate ive felt towards women weighs heavy on my heart.

18232,1hitahk,post,"My ex murdered someone, and I'm feeling guilty.","So I broke up with my ex a little over a decade ago, for VERY good reasons. He had always had a tough go of things - we got together when we were still very young, but while I grew up, got educated and found stable work, he struggled. Some days I felt like he was afraid of succeeding at stuff - he dropped out of classes just before the final exam, quit his jobs for pretty arbitrary reasons, etc. But his lack of success also wore on him. He was constantly disappointed in himself and the world, and by the time we broke up he had started getting involved with drugs (I didn't know that at the time, but in hindsight I was pretty dumb not to realize it sooner) and some really nasty people.

He also completely trashed my apartment and was making me start to genuinely fear for my life and my safety, so there's that. I made him give me his key, got him to leave the apartment, locked the door and never let him in again. Healthiest decision of my life, even if it messed me up royally for a good while. I thought I was basically sending him off to his death, and it was so hard to see myself as someone who could be so callous toward a friend who had been a partner for like twelve long years before things started turning really bad.

Little did I know, it would be so much worse.

As i unfortunately expected, he did continue his downward spiral. Unlike me, he didn't have much of a support network to begin with, and the drugs weren't exactly helping him maintain what little he still had. They also triggered mental issues, that worsened progressively. I know this because he kept trying to contact me. I never replied to any of his attempts, and blocked him wherever I found him, but that didn't stop him at all. When I found out my phone actually received and saved blocked messages even though it didn't show them to me, I checked them and found nearly 150 messages, all some level of unhinged. He was tracking a world-spanning rape-and-torture conspiracy, he had recently met a legendary criminal (who has been dead for more than 20 years but ok), he had had a paradigm-shifting insight into the nature of time and gravity and it was going to make him famous, he threatened to have the police come over and take back the stuff that he left at my place (that I had already had his sister come and collect for him years ago), he told me that he had beaten up people, that gangsters were out to get him, that all his friends had abandoned him, That I owed him money (he owes me a HEFTY sum, but I'd gladly pay twice that to keep him out of my life) and I'd better get it to him immediately or else, etc. etc. Oh, and sometimes he told me he prayed for me and my family to be blessed and happy, which was nice of him, I guess...

He also reported me to the police twice, as he was absolutely certain I had been kidnapped and tortured. A bit bizarre to be sitting at home with a cat in my lap and have the cops call me to ask if I was being held against my will somewhere.

His unhinged text messages mentioned that he was very displeased with how little support I was getting from the police, and how he had really tried to get them to help me. I'm sure, in his own world, he was trying to win me back by saving me from a bad situation - only problem was that he'd probably just dreamt the whole thing. But having trouble distinguishing dreams from reality is not good, and I was very worried about what else ""I"" was telling him in his dreams/hallucinations.

I half expected him to show up outside my house or my job some night, and tried to think of what I could do or say to get out of such a situation intact, but thankfully he never did. Nevertheless, those were years when I was always walking around with a hard ball of stress and anxiety in my chest, never really fully able to relax. I took to sleeping with a knife next to my bed

Fast forward to about two years ago.

I had just gotten off a late-night shift and collapsed in my bed. the time was something like 2 a.m. and I was sleeping heavily when the signal from my phone jolted me awake. I looked at the phone while it kept ringing until I had gathered up enough awake-brain to realize that it was a number I did not recognize. At this hour, from an unknown number - it pretty much had to be him. I let the call go to voicemail, as I always do since the break-up when unknown numbers call me. No message. But as i laid back down and tried to calm down from the adrenaline spike, the phone chimed twice. No text, just pictures. Bad quality ones. I was still a bit groggy both from the lack of sleep and the burst of panic, so I didn't make much sense of them. The first one looked like a picture of a credit card or something, the other one was of a man in his underwear, sitting in a couch, looking away from the camera - and there seemed to be blood on his head. Not much, but like he'd been in a fight or something. All I knew for sure was that I didn't know the man or the place where he was. Nothing about it made sense.

I figured I should save the photos, but my first priority was to block the number. By now I was shaking and my mind had seriously blanked. I was almost afraid to touch the phone for fear of accidentally calling him back - and somehow I ended up deleting the photos.

What followed was a lot of me trying to convince myself that it was probably nothing, that I was exaggerating, that it was just someone who'd gotten the wrong number or something. That it had nothing to do with me. That no one was going to take me seriously anyway - ""Yes, officer, I believe my ex of ten years might be up to something bad... no, I'm not sure what, but he sent me these pictures - at least I think it might have been him, but it was a number I've never seen before and... no, I accidentally deleted them, but I think there was a guy with some blood on his head... no, I don't know where this might be... no, I don't know who the guy with the blood was... yes, I'm sorry to bother you. So sorry. Yes. A good night to you too.""

Eventually I managed to go back to sleep.

I don't remember how much later, but I get a call from the police again. And this time they want me to come in for an interview. My thoughts immediately goes to that late-night call, and the pictures, and I agree because of course I do. The first thing they say when I come in, before I've even sat down, is ""Do you know (Ex's name)?""

It turns out, he had this guy locked up in his apartment for DAYS. Beating him, humiliating him, stabbing him - and ultimately killing him. It turned out the dead man was an actual sex offender, and I am sure that my ex was finally acting out his vigilante dreams, but the police never found any evidence that Ex knew who the guy was at all. At the interview I gave them everything I could think of, and when they said they might be able to retrieve the deleted photos I offered them my phone, which they formally registered and kept for about a week. I don't know if it helped any, but I hope so.

In any case, he was sentenced to the harshest possible punishment (we don't have the death penalty where I live, but it is highly unlikely he will ever be free again) which was a huge help to my mental well-being. Knowing that he is definitely off the streets has allowed me to begin to slowly relax and start living normally again. Only one thing keeps gnawing at my conscience...

The night he tried to call me, and sent me those pictures... was the first night that he had the guy. That man was alive and suffering HORRIBLY for TWO MORE DAYS after that. He had family. A sister. A mother.

If I had answered the phone...

Or called the police...

Or SOMETHING other than just turning over and going back to sleep and try to forget...

It eats at me.



EDIT: I'm so sorry, I forgot to say that that thing that registered in my sleep-deprived brain as ""I dunno... credit card...? Maybe...?"" actually turned out to be the man's ID. If I had studied that picture a little more closely, or kept the images like I intended to, I might have been able to give the cops a name, maybe even an address to go to for inquiries. Sure, the whole thing went down at Ex's apartment, but I still can't help but play the ""what if"" game. I know I shouldn't.

18233,1heakbg,post,My friend of 23 years has been acting weird lately,"I want to say I noticed it around the end of November that he started acting out of character. He went with me to store to get some soda for Thanksgiving dinner. After we checked out he tells me, “I bet that cashier wasn’t actually woman.” I looked back and asked why that mattered and he said “I just wanted you to know.” I tucked it away as a weird comment, but then it just kept going. It was like his catchphrase for any non-conventionally attractive woman. Any woman that he doesn’t see as a 10/10 must be a man according to him.

He’s also gotten really weird about Mexicans, and as a Mexican man that’s made me the most uncomfortable. He showed me a Tik Tok of this guy taking advantage of a Spanish speakers and having them say inappropriate things. I told him I didn’t find it funny and that it’s disgusting. He asked why I was so offended and I had to point to my skin. He told me “Yeah, but you’re not like Mexican Mexican. You were born here” I told him that’s pretty messed up to say and he rolls his eyes and just keeps scrolling.

He recently started making hypothetical scenarios involving women, lesbians, and trans people running up on him and how he’d fight back regardless of their sex and orientation. I mean, I would also fight back against someone who was hitting me, but he’s been bringing up these topics almost unprompted. Like we’d be on a drive listening to music and then he’d just come up with this scenario.

I don’t know what’s up with him. I’ve been friends with him for 23 years. We’ve gone through so much and now he’s been acting super strange since November.

The only reason I’m even posting this is because he’s taken a huge anti-vax stance which is way out of left field for him since he graduated college with a bachelor of science. It just feels weird.","My friend of 23 years has been acting weird lately I want to say I noticed it around the end of November that he started acting out of character. He went with me to store to get some soda for Thanksgiving dinner. After we checked out he tells me, “I bet that cashier wasn’t actually woman.” I looked back and asked why that mattered and he said “I just wanted you to know.” I tucked it away as a weird comment, but then it just kept going. It was like his catchphrase for any non-conventionally attractive woman. Any woman that he doesn’t see as a 10/10 must be a man according to him.

He’s also gotten really weird about Mexicans, and as a Mexican man that’s made me the most uncomfortable. He showed me a Tik Tok of this guy taking advantage of a Spanish speakers and having them say inappropriate things. I told him I didn’t find it funny and that it’s disgusting.

18234,1hcs9yz,post,(M29) My sister (F27) is in love with and dating a currently incarcerated convicted rapist,"TLDR: my sister met a guy who was convicted of assaulting and raping a girl before he was sentenced to prison, apparently loves him, and has continued to visit him in prison. I love my sister and want a relationship with her but I want absolutely nothing to do with this person.

So for context I live on the west coast, as does my whole family, and my sister lives on the east coast. Around May-ish of last year she met this guy on Hinge and started seeing him. At the time he apparently had already been charged and convicted of assaulting and raping a girl at his apartment, and was awaiting sentencing. My sister for whatever reason liked him and continued seeing him, even attending the sentencing hearing and meeting his family. He was sentenced to 18 months in prison and registered as a sex offender (extremely light IMO), meaning he will be released this Jan '25. My family found out because her friends where she lives were very concerned and texted my younger brother, who then let me know. I immediately told my parents because i'm not messing around with something like this. My parents were freaked out obviously and that's how the whole situation unfolded.

Early on whenever she was confronted about it or we even talked about it she would burst into tears and it would become basically impossible to talk to her. Many of her friends have stopped seeing her because they are obviously not comfortable with this at all and my sister was not responsive at all to their concerns. I imagine she believes it is her against the world and other people just don't understand. She has visited him in prison along with his family multiple times and has seemingly no intention of stopping this relationship. He is currently her phone background.

This whole situation has weighed so heavily on me. I love my sister and want the best for her, but I also want absolutely nothing to do with a convicted rapist sex offender. She has come home for thanksgiving last year and this year, and the subject is just not spoken about because everyone knows she would freak out and it would turn into a huge fight/ordeal. But you can just tell that everyone is thinking about it and avoiding the subject/walking on eggshells around her.

I believe we can't keep going on like this. It weighs so heavily on me and my parents especially, but she shows no signs of ending this, and I don't want to not have a relationship with my sister. It also feels like this dark secret I can't tell anyone. I'm dating and have had healthy relationships with partners and friends alike. How am I supposed to tell someone this? Even my best friends do not know, but as we approach the new year I feel like I just need to get this off my chest to them at least. This issue was a large contributing factor that prompted me to seek therapy and that is going well but I have not found peace with this issue yet.

As of now, if the relationship continues when he gets out of prison, I am going to express to my sister that I love her and want the best for her but cannot support her current relationship and will have zero involvement. If anyone has any feedback, input, or wisdom on how you would approach this issue or how you have dealt with something similar I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you. (This is my first post like this and it is an emotional one so apologies for any errors or faux pas)","(M29) My sister (F27) is in love with and dating a currently incarcerated convicted rapist TLDR: my sister met a guy who was convicted of assaulting and raping a girl before he was sentenced to prison, apparently loves him, and has continued to visit him in prison.

18235,1hb4tlj,post,"My girlfriend is abusing me and my friends are concerned, but I love it.","I’ve been praying for a girlfriend my whole life and was lucky enough to get one last year. We met at comic con, she was Spider-Gwen, I was Miles Morales, it was fitting. I had to tell her I liked her cosplay and ask for her number. She happily gave it to me and we spent hours going to panels and shopping around. When we stopped to get food I realized I would have to take off my mask and so would she. We’d been talking with our masks on the entire time, though with her figure and voice I knew she would be stunning. I was right, she took off her mask to eat the fires she ordered and it was like a blinding light of beauty that could be felt across all nine realms. I was scared to take mine off in case she thought I was ugly but I did it quickly to get it over with. She told me I looked handsome. I thought she was lying but that look she gave me told me otherwise. We talked about our favorite cartoon network shows and ate until she picked up a fry and said “open wide good boy.” I gobbled the fry and we both laughed over it as a joke but I was melting on the inside.

Skipping forward a bit we took some photos for some photographer and spent the rest of the day together. We said our goodbyes as everyone began to leave and headed home. We kept in touch until around winter break where I stayed at her place for a week and we made it official. She lived a state away from me so I couldn’t visit her as much as I liked, though when I did it was heavenly. I noticed that after a few months she became very touchy in public, I would tell her to wait a little until we got somewhere private but that only made her feral. I tried to bring it up to her one morning and she got offended quickly. She pushed me and I tripped on my damn sock and she got on top of me. She’s older and more athletic than I am so it was hard to get her off of me.

I don’t think I need to explain what followed.

When she was done she sat on the couch and put me in her lap saying she only does what she does because she loves me. It didn’t really get better from there, she would just kinda take me whenever she wanted. Even when I’m feeding the cat she’ll sometimes come up behind me and make me drop everything so she can make me cum. I’ve never been opposed to dominant women if anything I preferred my partner to be dominant, but this was more than I expected.

It’s crazy to so but I’ve honestly started to really like the way she treats me, I’ll even act like I don’t want to so she’ll be more assertive. I told a few of my friends some of what she’s been doing and they told me to get out of the relationship, but I don’t want to. It’s like I want to get out so I’m not being abused but I also love the way she makes me feel. She’s not just using me for sex we do all sorts of lovey dovey relationship stuff, I’ve even talked about moving in with her.

18236,1h74hgd,post,"My boyfriend lost his sh*t because he saw our Sims ""WooHooing""","ETA: The clickbait was just a little joke, I didn't think it would gain this much attention or offend that many people 😩 My bad, genuinely- can't edit the title

2nd ETA: Yes, I am now aware of Wonderful Whims' existence and have replaced Wicked with it- thank you all lmao!

My boyfriend and I like to spend quality time together on opposite sides of the bedroom, doing our own thing in each other's presence. I prefer quietly watching my shows, drawing, reading, playing chill games, etc. He likes hanging out on games like Rust and Call of Duty, yelling with his buddies in an xbox party. Between matches/raids/etc, he'll get up to check on me and give me a kiss. 

Tonight was normal, we were doing the same as usual; He was playing Rust and I was playing Sims 4. He got up to give me a kiss at the worst *possible* time- see, I have WickedWhims installed. If you aren't familiar, it turns the Sims' ""WooHoo"" into actual uncensored sex, but it also comes with things like periods, expanded personalities and behaviors, etc. I use it for the latter, and have sex autonomy settings turned off (so no sims will WooHoo without being commanded to do so). The thing is, I've been wanting my sims (me and him) to have a second baby. They had just started trying for one right as he came over, before I could switch to the POV of our son to continue cleaning as he was. 

When my boyfriend walked up, I jumped a bit and tried to move to get the view off our sims, and was unsuccessful. Honestly not sure why because he probably wouldn't have looked at my screen otherwise- Anyways, he naturally questioned my response. He didn't look at the screen again, just asked ""What was that about?"" I sat for a second, mildly panicked and trying to think of a good excuse, and I just gave up and said ""Our sims are fuggin"".

He. Fell. On. The. Ground. He was hyperventilating and in tears when he came back up, literally pointing and laughing at me. He said ""You had me thinking it was something else.. You reacted like a kid being caught watching porn"" and went back down for a minute. We laughed together a bit longer, he told me he loves me so much, and we continued happily playing our games afterwards. 

I just thought it was funny, and I think really shows how genuine but unserious our love for each other is, so I wanted to share lmao. I'm sorry for the obligatory clickbait-y title, I also thought that was funny lol. I love my boyfriend a lot.","My boyfriend lost his sh*t because he saw our Sims ""WooHooing"" ETA: The clickbait was just a little joke, I didn't think it would gain this much attention or offend that many people 😩 My bad, genuinely- can't edit the title

I was sexually abused by two siblings, a sister and a older brother by the time I was around 8 years old and it went on and off till i was about 11.

In the end I cut ties with my brother as he had no ""excuse"" for what he did but I kept sort of friendly terms with my sister up till recently (because of the circumstances I mentioned regarding her abuse towards me I didn't disown her straight away).

All of this led to me having an unhealthy relationship to being with people and how I treated sex. I only ever saw relationships as a vehicle to having sex for my own gratification and not for the emotional contact you had with someone else, this ended up with me having ""relationships"" where I didn't give any effort to them and just did what I had to do to convince the girls I was seeing to sleep with me.  
This lasted till I was 31 and I met someone who I was finally able to have a normal relationship with and we're together now for 14 years, have 2 kids and are happy together.

\---------------

Fast forward to now, we allow our son to sleep at his nans house occasionally since she lives so close to us he can quickly run around there for bedtime and then come back home to get ready for school in the morning.  
My mum has a relative living there with her because he was made homeless about a year ago and she took him in to help out.  
This week I found out that the relative was on the sex offenders register for having certain illegal content on it related to kids.

Now my first reaction was calm, collected and reasonible towards almost everyone involved in this situation with the relative being the exception to my calmness.  
That was till I was informed the same day I found out about all this that social services are now going to be called on me and we're going to be investigated for child endangerment for allowing our son to sleep in the same house with a sex offender.  
I'm not worried about this investigtion, we knew nothing about the situation till this week, the person in question is a close relative so its not like we were letting our son stay with a unknown entity here, we just weren't informed about the situation by anyone.

That last part is where the friction with the family starts, NO one told us about the relative being on the sex offenders registry when aparently EVERYONE knew about it except us, my mum knew, her sister knew, my cousins knew.  
When I told everyone about how their secret they decided to keep from me has caused this situation with social services to happen and now my wife is having constant breakdowns and panic attacks becasuse shes worried we'll lose our children (i did say I wasn't worried, my wife on the other hand is a wrecked ball of nerves), when I told everyone involved this aparently I'm over reacting being angry about it.

The sister who abused me as a kid was defending this relative saying people make mistakes, I guess I'll drop the fact now the relative on the register is her eldest kid, who she kicked out of home and made him homeless in the first place because she didn't want social services knocking on her door worried about her 2 other children.  
Now I got really pissed at this point and called her out that she was worried about how her kid might abuse her other children so she kicked him out but she never once thought to tell me my kid could be in danger, that none of my family who knew never tried to warn me, not even my own mum

I've cut ties with everyone now and I'm still just right up to before writing this getting angry texts from them moaning about how unreasonable I'm being and how stupid I am for being angry with them all over this.

I'm refusing to be angry anymore but I am disappointed, let down and betrayed, especailly with my sister and mum who both know that I was abused as a child because one delt with the fallout from that and the other was the one who did the abusing.

18239,1gqvi48,post,I don't love my mother anymore.,"(TW: Mention of attempted suicide.) 

So, yeah. The title is pretty self-explanatory, but I feel like context is important.

  
So I, F(I won't say my actual age, since I'm not very comfortable in it, but I'm in high school), have had a strained relationship with my mom for a while now.

  
When I was developing most as a person (Think ages five-nine), I never saw much of my mom, since she had a job in the medical industry that required her to take calls, so some of my earliest memories is me mouthing 'are you on a call' to her just to make sure it was okay to even talk to her. She was pretty emotionally neglectful, which I only realized recently. When she wasn't working, she was cooking, arguing with my dad, or in the living room watching TV watching hit TV shows to watch in the family upstairs living room with your six year old wandering around, such as Sex in the City.

  
She often drove me to Speech Therapy when I was seven. I never really knew why she took me there until I started recognizing symptoms of autism and ADHD in myself and ended up asking her a couple times if I was neurodivergent. The first time, she told me no. The last time I asked, she said yes, I was high-functioning autistic. Apparently, I was diagnosed at three, but I didn't get to know that until seven years later. So every time I had headaches in school, every time I got overstimulated and couldn't put my finger on why, she didn't tell me, and I had headaches for a couple years daily just thinking it was normal. She said she didn't tell me because she didn't want me to feel bad about myself, although I'm not entirely convinced that's the reason, considering the fact I've always been very accepting of people who are different.

  
I've always been sensitive to her yelling. At me, at my brothers, and at my dad. Recently, I've started recording the fights she has with my dad so that in the event they hopefully get a divorce, my dad can get primary custody. She's also yelled at me on multiple occasions, despite knowing it makes me cry. Once, she sent my brother to his room when I was around nine and so I went to comfort him and we watched a couple videos together. When she found out, she screamed at me and sent me to my room where I cried for an hour and even attempted to hang myself on my doorknob using a bead necklace I had. I went upstairs and tried to apologize, and she said my apology wasn't good enough and sent me back to my room. After another hour, I finally came up with a mediocre apology that was considered good enough for her.

A few years ago, she was diagnosed with stage three ovarian cancer, and we only grew more distant. I understand she had cancer, and I understood the chemo was having harsh effects on her body and mind, but I ended up seeing myself as more of a nurse to her, handing her the skittles, the remote, getting her a sparkling water from the fridge, or something to drink, rather than a daughter trying to take care of her sick mother. She's doing much better now and hasn't been in chemo for months now.

Recently, she's been very absent. The only time I see her is brief chats afterschool that last maybe five minutes at most or during dinner.

  
Dinner was the cause of our most recent argument.

My grandma was over and we were having a meal that everyone else likes, but I don't, so I was just having something simple. Our dinner is very scheduled, mom usually has it ready at 6, and if she doesn't, we can usually go downstairs and she'll call us up when it's ready. Since grandma was over, though, she wanted us to stay upstairs and socialize, which I learned after I started to go downstairs.

Around ten minutes later, my dad comes in from playing with our dog in the backyard. Mom starts to argue with him about how he always comes to dinner at the last second and leaves as soon as possible. She knows I hate it when they fight. My dad apologized again and again like usual, but mom just kept trying to argue like she always does. I stood up and told her if she kept fighting with dad, I was going downstairs.

  
Around five minutes after that, I asked her how much longer dinner was going to be, since it was around fifteen minutes late at this point, (I know it wasn't very long, but I'm one of the kids victim to a 'let the internet parent' parenting style and don't have a very good attention span anymore), and she said around fifteen to twenty minutes. I asked to go downstairs, since everyone else was busy talking to each other and I had run out of things to talk about. 

She reminded me of something she said a couple months ago when I kept asking whether or not I could eat in my room, where she said if I asked one more time, I could go to my room without dinner, so I said I would be fine with that. She started to tear up and asked me if I even cared about what other people thought. (For a little extra context, I did temporarily become somewhat sociopathic due to extreme bullying in the last school year, but luckily I'm hardly being bullied anymore.) 

I ended up expressing that I know dinner is important to her, but that dinner is a meal, and this was just talking. She claimed I don't stop to consider what other people think, and in a heated moment fueled by years of keeping my mouth shut and lying when I said I loved her, I ended up telling her that clearly she doesn't stop to think what other people think either. She got offended and ended up telling me that she does 98% of the work in this relationship and I only do 2% before I walked down the stairs and went to go cry in my room.

  
I feel horrible. All this time I've tried to be a good daughter for her. Love her, support her, get good grades, make her look good, but I don't love her anymore. I feel horrible about myself and I feel so conflicted. On one hand, I feel like I was in the right and my friends seem to agree, but on the other hand, I feel like a horrible person.

Thanks for reading, I just really needed to talk to someone about this.","I don't love my mother anymore. (TW: Mention of attempted suicide.) 

So, yeah. The title is pretty self-explanatory, but I feel like context is important.

  
So I, F(I won't say my actual age, since I'm not very comfortable in it, but I'm in high school), have had a strained relationship with my mom for a while now.

18240,1gp6l8n,post,My small familial relationships make everything else so hard,"So to start, problems arise in my relationships which I believe to be largely in part to my upbringing being very emotionally rough, as well as my current living situation. I'm in a long distance relationship with my girlfriend of 4 years, and I'm very much in love. I have a very small circle of friends (about 5 of them consistently with more that come and go,) that I love to death, but can't really talk to cause I just don't think they'd understand. This friend group of mine is purely online as we each live in different states, but we have met in real life and I even went to school with one of them as a youth. It's more of a nasty combination of not wanting to burden them (despite knowing they'd be more than willing to be ""burdened,"") and feeling as if I know what they will say already, so why bother? Anyway the point is that I don't have any real immediate connections physically outside of the family members I live with. Which brings us to the current biggest issue at hand.

My Mom and I both live with my grandparents, whose political alignment doesn't matter BUT their interest and honestly, obsession with their side of politics, makes it very hard to interact with them WITHOUT having the conversation relate back to the ""state our country is in."" Their political alignment is the most defining part of their personality now. It doesn't help at all that just a few weeks ago they were at each others throats screaming about divorce and from the sounds of it how much they have truly hated each other over their 30+ years of marriage. Regardless they're not exactly friendly. For example they've made sure to make all 3 of our closest neighbors hate us whether it's through camera's pointing at each others house or corrections to lawn behavior/etiquette. With the exception of us all of their family has either cut them out or been cut out, the same goes to the few friends they had but I believe that to be more of a reflection of time passing. My feelings of love for them are FINALLY almost completely gone because I've heard for countless years the hatred they've spewed about any and everyone including myself. The hardest part of living with them is the constant threat of doomsday that they've perpetuated; ""so and so wants to kill us with bombs,"" ""this group of people are terrorist/murderers/rapist,"" ""the alarm the government is sending out is going to activate the covid vaccine and turn us into zombies,"" ""this group of activist is going to take over and have people like us hung."" At the end of the day I know getting out and away is the solution but throughout my childhood they've conditioned me into feeling like I can't survive without them and that's what makes my relationship with them hard.

My relationship with my mother is most accurately depicted by the Behemoth roller coaster at Canada's Wonderland (high highs and low lows.) Between the back and forth of living with her and living with my grandparents, she wasn't exactly the best. Childhood trauma isn't the focal point of what I'm saying, but to summarize as a child I never saw her as a caregiver or someone that fit my idea of a ""mother."" In contrast, when I grew up I started to see her as an ally, then a friend, then someone motherly. But because of the volatility of our relationship, I've never felt I could fully trust that she wants what's best for me/cares as much about me as she says. Deep rooted trust issues SURPRISE SURPRISE! I believe she has ADHD which is a bit of a point of contention because I'm not a doctor, and she refuses to get diagnosed. I've expressed in the past how sometimes it's hard to talk to her cause of her getting distracted or derailing the conversation or just completely taking over. Which is largely (there's much more,) why I believe in my unprofessional diagnosis of her ADHD. I won't feign ignorance in that I can see how this would offend someone, but usually her responses result in denial, followed by attacks to my character. Honestly in a lot of situations where she is criticized even remotely negatively by me it results in her following DARVO to an impressive degree. What happened between us today is the straw that broke the camels back and kick started me writing this in the first place. I wanted to share with her where I think my head is at with my girlfriend, and how I'm kind of struggling to identify if I'm being complacent in our relationship. I had expressed at the beginning that it's really hard to talk about cause it's safe to assume what people would say, and that this is the first time I've talked to ANYONE about all the details. Our conversation ends prematurely cause as I'm talking to her (about 30 minutes have past at this point,) I pause to collect my thoughts and she comes in with a pair of jeans and a t-shirt asking, ""how much do you think we could sell this outfit for?"" I respond with where I think the value is, but I'm ultimately feeling down because I just poured my guts out just for it to be followed up with that. After collecting my thoughts for a minute or two I bring it up to her, ""sometimes it's really hard to talk about heavy stuff with you because your ADHD can make what I said FEEL insignificant."" I recognize that I could have phrased it much better but I really expressed that it's just a feeling and that I understand and that I'm truly just sharing how what she did made me feel. But because I weaponized a ""disability"" that she's not even professionally diagnosed in she got really combative. Concluding with, ""every time we talk about you and your girlfriend, it disrupts our relationship and I don't ever want to talk to you about her again, good luck to you and to her and I wish you all the best."" This behavior is not new from her, usually her response to conflict is ""okay fine I'll NEVER EVER EVER DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT AGAIN."" There are some parts of the conversation that followed my offensive statement, but since I don't remember them verbatim I don't want to misconstrue them. Maybe I'll clarify further if there are questions/comments but I don't know yet.

I believe my relationship with my girlfriend to be rather conventional except for the long distance. The distance is a point of contention at the moment because of how long we've been together and societal pressures yada yada. I could gush about how amazing she is endlessly, but since this is a rather negative post where I'm trying to expel negativity allow me to summarize by saying she's extremely sweet. Where a majority of my problem lies with her is in accusations that have been thrown at me about her. These accusations paired with my obvious baggage do not make a great mix. In our four years of being together I have been reached out to randomly on instagram from four different people that she is cheating on me. I would like to believe I'm not naive but I for the most part think these are false claims. Because of the blow reading a message like that can do to someone in a long distance relationship, I tried to get more information before bringing it to her. Whether that was asking them, which in the first two had examples that I knew about/found out about that were very shady. I.E. she told some guy at a sneaker boutique she didn't have a boyfriend and traded instagrams with him. Or when she made a tinder because her friends were doing it and swiping for matches. She did exchange messages with some of the people on there (I asked if I could see,) but nothing indicative of cheating was at the very least still visible. The latest and fourth claim was the most odd, where I asked the guy about how he knows/who it is/why they're telling me, and they were very cryptic and shared no details so it was rather easy to brush off. Except for the fact that she was visiting me for my birthday that week and the guy had mentioned how she ""blew his friend off randomly for the next week,"" which was while she was with me. Since he didn't have anything that he wanted to present as evidence I just simply asked if I could go through her phone. She complied and I did some digging, didn't find anything relating back to the guy messaging me or any common friends. But I did read messages between her and a guy friend that she has that were quite alarming. Her responses never really entertained his messages but his messages were graphic/inappropriate, calling her ""babygirl,"" asking her to come over and sleep/drink, telling her about his sex life etc. When I confronted her on this similar to my mother (we really date our parents huh?) she responded with DARVO. This inevitably made me even more worried and an argument ensued. One of the things she said that stuck with me after calling her out on her use of DARVO was, ""not everything is psychology OP, you always try to think into what I do or say!"" I still disagree because quite literally, EVERYTHING IS psychology, but I digress. My passion/interest for behavioral science aside, we were able to clear the air. I was able to express how it was incredibly disrespectful to me and our relationship that she couldn't establish boundaries with him, and she reassured me that nothing happened. What troubles me is that I'm not ignorant to the possibility of her cheating, we don't exactly have the best sex life (largely in part to my lower sex drive,) and I more than understand that usually that's a key component to a cheater committing the act of cheating. However a lot of her time is accounted for. We spend most of our non working hours AND some of our working hours in a discord call. She's honest about where she goes and I believe she's honest about who she's with. We share locations with each other, and text every so often while we're out doing whatever. So her windows would be short BUT not impossible. My trust issues mixed with 4 random accusations and an common/understandable reason (it's still not right/okay but I get why it happens,) make trusting her word a little bit harder of a pill to swallow. Which leads me to my main point of inner conflict, am I just complacent and comfortable but unable/unwilling to forgive and trust? Or do I truly love her and this is just a growing pain that is going to take more than 5 months to get over? 

I was going to write another paragraph about my relationship with my self, but I'm writing this and one sitting and kind of emotionally expended. I may return with an edit since I do believe it's important to provide context about myself. Despite all of this I'm happy though, I think idk maybe it's delusion, but I have a goal career I want to pursue, I love my friends, I love the time I have to myself, and I do love my girlfriend. I was going to plug this into grammarly and hopefully make it more palatable to potential readers but this is offmychest and I just want it off my chest. Thanks for reading, I just really needed to share my feelings with anything besides myself really.

18241,1go92rc,post,My Buddy’s  Housing Struggle With a Felony,"A life long buddy of mine (27m) has a felony bc he slept with a girl when he was 19.

The girl said they didn’t have sex, but he did. Anyways, a “rape kit” that was forced on her came back negative, so again, no hard proof. Anyways, fast forward, he ended up accepting a plea deal to do 3 yrs in prison so that he didn’t have to face a jury trial, and wouldn’t have to register as a sex offender. 
He’s out, he’s ok, but now he’s having a hard time adapting to real life. He has a hard time getting a job bc of said felony, and even worse than that is finding a good place to stay. 
I know most of you will say “just move in with someone.” But the thing is that there’s basically only rental properties where we live, and the rental properties will not allow you to just stay with someone. Every person living in the place HAS TO fill out an application or everyone will be evicted. Most people won’t chance that.
So, he’s stuck in an overpriced trailer that’s about to fall apart. It’s such a shit box. He’s too scared to fuss at them or lodge a complaint bc he’ll get kicked out of the one place he can live. It’s so frustrating to watch. ","My Buddy’s  Housing Struggle With a Felony A life long buddy of mine (27m) has a felony bc he slept with a girl when he was 19.

18242,1gm4uap,post,Stepdad in prison because of me and I can't sleep because of it,"My stepfather sexually abused my son. I did the only thing I could and reported it to the police. My cousin then told me he sexually abused her too when she was younger. We just got through a four year legal battle and court case and won- my stepfather is now in prison.

The thing is- my mum stuck by him and hates me with a passion, she also got other people to scream at me and intimidate me throughout the court case.

This has all brought up such complicated feelings. It took a lot for me to even forgive my mum awful physical child abuse and rebuild a relationship with her and now she's chosen a convicted sex offender over me and her grandkids.

My family is ruined and although I'm so pleased he was found guilty I'm now filled with guilt myself worrying about him in prison and how my mum and younger sister will cope

18243,1gg3yo4,post,Snoring is ruining my relationship ,"Like the title says, trying to sleep with my fiance is ruining my life. 

Last night I was yet again woken up through the wall at 6am after 4 hours of sleep and couldn't go back to sleep because of the fucking snoring and feel like I want to just end it

Let me preface this with the fact I've lived and shared sleeping spaces with other people and partners before without issue. Like I've slept across Europe in hostels with 12 people in a room but I cannot stand sleeping with my fiance.

The worst part is it wasn't always like this in the first 2ish years of our relationship. The snoring was *nothing* like it is now, because he could easily be turned on his side and wear a nose strip, which effectively solved the problem. I'm pretty sure it's because he's gained weight and drinks too much (daily), but nothing I say will make him want to change that.

The cliffnotes:

Me
- adhd + snoring as a misophonia trigger
- requires either silence or constant noise (like white noise) to fall asleep 
- had extensive jaw surgery making prolonged earplug wear painful
- needs a minimum of 30+ minutes to fall asleep without drugs or alcohol 
- will struggle to fall back asleep if woken

Him
-  choke snores like a derailed train all night in every position at a decibel that offends god and echoes through the entire apartment 
- falls asleep in 1 second and cannot be woken up afterwards without literally screaming at him 
- will fall back asleep in 1 second if you manage to wake him up. This includes asking him to move to the couch, which involves asking 30 times and waking him up from snoring *sitting up right*

Things we've tried:
- nose strips 
- mouth guard 
- pillows 
- waiting for me to fall asleep first (impossible unless I'm extremely drunk)
- separate rooms (snoring can be heard through all walls, and I need to wear earplugs anyway because I can't tolerate it. Multiple problems with this include pain, missing my alarms and being late for work)
- sleeping pills (I shouldn't have to effectively drug myself to tolerate sleeping with someone, also the next day side effects are brutal) 
- mouth taping

I'd like to try custom earplugs, but I don't have $500 to drop on that at the moment. 

A typical night of trying to sleep together will be me running a fan, taking several relaxation and sleep aids, wearing earplugs and trying to fall asleep as fast as possible. When he inevitably sleeps first, we'll fall into a familiar bullshit pattern. It's me sleeping in 1-2 hour increments between being woken up by the snoring and having to kick and yell at him to get him to stop until the sleep anxiety prevents me from sleeping again. Repeat ad nauseam. 

I recently spent a weekend at my parent's place for Thanksgiving and I swear to god I slept like the dead uninterrupted for 12 hours every night, zero substances involved. The relief I felt was palpable. I know it's him that's causing this problem, and I'm so fucking angry every day. It makes me snap at him all the time, and you can imagine what that's done to my sex life. I'm in an open relationship, for fuck’s sake, and I'm too pissed off at him to even care about sleeping with someone else. I'm pissed off that he lives like a slob and doesn't take care of himself, and there's nothing I can do about it. What am I supposed to do, waterboard him in our bathtub until he books a dentist appointment? (he has been ONCE in the last 5 years and it's only because I forced him) 

And yes, before I get slammed with an avalanche of ""get a sleep study"" comments, I have been literally on my knees begging him to get one done for over a year because all the men in his family have sleep apnea and he probably does too. For a long time the conversation was shut down with ""the sound of the cpap machine would keep you awake anyways,"" (even when I showed him videos of cpap machines demonstrating the level of noise they produce is no more than running an air conditioner) and ""it's too expensive"" (even when I showed him that it would be covered by our healthcare and his insurance) and ""it probably won't help the snoring"" (even when I showed him that regardless of the snoring, untreated sleep apnea can literally kill you). Last week, after essentially being shamed by my brother, he *finally* made the phone call for a consultation where they said it was very likely he had it, but now he needs to get a referral from a doctor to move forward with the at-home sleep study and guess what, *he still hasn't done it!*

I'm so fucking done with this man.

4 days ago I woke up with severe neck spasms and my neck locked, and it freaked me out so I went to a physiotherapist who said ""it's like someone has wrung your entire neck out"" and asked me if I was going through any major life stress. 🙃 Like I guess so, if you consider sleep anxiety as a major life stress.

He is, understandably, also developing sleep anxiety from all the nights of being kicked and yelled at. I've tried to explain that I sometimes spend upwards of 10 minutes trying to wake him up by whispering in his ear, kissing his cheek, rubbing his shoulder, gently asking him to please wake up etc, and he will not fucking wake up unless he's kicked and yelled at. Even then, that's rolling the dice. This has actually destroyed my desire to think about a family with this person. 

So we've given up on sleeping together, but that doesn't even help much because like I've said, I can still hear him snoring throughout the entire goddamn apartment. I feel like I'm literally trapped between the pages of The Trial. I can't escape. 

When I'm pissed off like this I like to imagine throwing every single fucking crusty sock and the sea of dirty clothes he leaves on the floor 24/7 into a garbage bag and smacking him in the face with it just to see the other half of the bedroom floor.

I hate how angry this makes me.

18245,1fvfx61,post,My mom is dating a pedophile,"Okay, here’s some background info on my family.  There’s me (24nb) and I have two sisters (21 and 25) and one brother (5).  Our parents divorced when I was 14 and my younger brother has a different father.  Once my mom had my brother, my little sister was heavily parentified and spent the majority of her high school years taking care of our brother and continues to babysit almost daily/frequently overnight . My little sister is also in the process of buying my moms house, so they live together right now.   My moms been dating my brothers father for the last 5 years but they broke up like 3 months ago and now she’s dating this new guy.

So this guy is a convicted sex offender, on the list and everything.  His offense was sex with a minor, I think 2nd degree.  There’s just a lot about him that makes me uncomfortable.  He met my mom literally the weekend she broke up with my brothers dad and she sent me a weird text saying he’s “the one” - this is not really how my mom talks and acts.  He basically moved to the same town my mom lives in like 2 weeks later.
 
He’s been causing some fights and stuff between my little sister and mom.  My mom was going to throw my little sister a birthday party later this month but I guess her bf said something about my little sister being ungrateful and my mom cancelled the party. My sisters are both concerned about this guy being alone with our brother.  My mom works nights and so my little sister watches my brother most nights but my mom is going to move out once my sister buys the house and we don’t like the idea of them all living together.

 My mom is talking about getting married to the guy, even though since she’s divorced my dads she’s always said she never wants to get married again.  He also JUST filed for divorce from his wife who he was married to before he went to prison. Which apparently my mom also paid for.

 It’s like my mom has had a complete personality shift and I’m very wary of this guy.  I live an hour and half from my family but they all live in the same small town and I’ve been hearing most of this second hand from my sisters.  I don’t know if there’s anything I can or should do?  I also don’t know if I’m overreacting (I believe that he technically took a plea deal, but that was after he was convicted and it was overturned I think) but I’m just deeply uncomfortable with the whole situation.

TW: Rape & suicide


I (25M) had this freelance employer (31F) who had always been trying to get me to have sex with her since we met. 

It's quite new for me because I'm from Mindanao, Philppines and grew up in church. She, on the other hand, grew up in a liberal lifestyle in Laguna, on the other end of the Philippines. I would repeatedly say no and tell her we're just friends and that i don't like her like that. There was a time when she was so high that she almost begged me to have her in bed. Now, I have a girlfriend (25F) at that time and I just laughed at her knowing she was high as hell. Soon after that, i cut her off. 

A few months later, this woman contacted me again, desperate for the work that I did for her because i was the only one who understands the assignments she gives me. Because i have a very low paying job, I reluctantly accepted. 

By this time, my then girlfriend broke up with me because i had, and I quote: ""not a dream for myself in sight."" When I was busting my balls trying to save up for us. (We were together 5 years at that time.) 

Hearing my heartbreak, as I was madly in love with my then girlfriend at the time, my employer (31F) sprung in action. She would send me gifts (the ones she know I really liked), and even sent me to Manila as I have never been to the capital before. She knew I loved history so she took me on a tour around Binondo and museums there. 

She was obsessed with me, and I'm not saying that just to flatter myself, she erected a small shrine for me in her house and offered cocoa on it every single day. I knew because she'd send me pictures that she did it even when i didn't want her doing any of that. 

That said, she also knew that I take utang na loob very seriously. She knows how I was taught to always repay the good things given to me, and never take revenge or hold a grudge if offended. 

After Manila, she stayed in my house for a few days because she wanted to celebrate her birthday in my city. (She lives in Cotabato for work). I offered her my room while I slept in the living room. 

One night, she texted me to come to the room and called on the ""utang na loob"" that I incurred upon her. Something happened to us, but it was not something I enjoyed or appreciated. I just laid there while she had her way with me. All the while, I was holding back tears while I thought of my ex at the time. 

Two weeks later, she texted me she was pregnant. My entire world crumbled. I refused to go home because I was sobbing uncontrollably, and I don't want my mother to hear me. Luckily, it was a friday and I was alone in the office for two days. Unluckily, this was the beginning of my descent to darkness. 

I told her I never wanted her, that I was willing to take the baby and raise it alone than to be with her. This is after she gave me an ultimatum that she'd abort the baby if I don't marry her. These conversations and arguments would last for a week and I hid it from everyone. I even began tying a noose for myself (I consider myself an expert in tying a noose, the literal hangman's noose) because i was so defeated.

While I was battling that woman and myself, my then ex returned out of the blue and told me she still loved me. Even after she belittled me, I still loved her. So i told her everything and she decided to accept me. 

Meanwhile, before this other woman would know my ex returned, she claimed to have had a miscarriage. 

Now, when she learnes my ex returned, the other woman wouldn't accept that, she wanted me so bad that she contacted my then girlfriend and told her lies about me. Our work meetings which were usually just me and her in a public place got turned to us going to a motel together. My then gf believed her more, even when I tried to explain.

I had to quit my job to preserve the image of the organization (I worked in an NGO that preserved women's and children's rights). She claimed that I defamed her because i told my then GF that ""I felt like I was raped."" (Take note, I know it wasn't constituted as rape, but as I was forced to do it, I felt like I was taken advantage of like that.) and further threatened to sue me for it. 

I tried to hang myself again. But I found that I couldn't do it because I'd leave my mother alone, not to mention my dogs who adore me. But I would just sit quietly and feel like i was having a heart attack because I was anxious of everything. 

I let the other woman be, and gave her everything she wanted, even drafting and signing an NDA that says we can never speak about it again because her reputation was tainted. I was humiliated in my previous bosses and her bosses who knows me because of the partnerships our organizations had before. 

My then GF and I would be together for another few months, I even gave her a promise ring because i really wanted to marry her at the time before she'd use all those things against me over and over again, when she, herself kissed another married man while we were still together, but kept it as a secret for so long. 

We broke up and my world crumbled again. I fought for her, appealed to how we grew up together, but she wouldn't have it. She'd rather ghost me than accept me again. So I finally stopped. 

That was 5 months ago. I got better, focusing on the fact that, I survived it all.

That is, until yesterday when my previous employer texted me. The following is the message she sent: 


""Hey its me. I ended things with anger and hate, and I just want you to know I regreted being that way. Ive been finally okay. Im happy. And since Ive been calm and regulated, I think I can finally say this- You deserve the truth. There wasnt any baby. Im sorry you have to find out this way.

Have a happy life. I wish you roses.
-D.""

She's more sorry I found out this way than being sorry she lied. 

I was taught not to harbor any ill will towards anyone, and I'm known to have immaculate patience. But I can't just fucking take it, she fucking lied! I lost everything, a job i was very much fucking passionate with, a woman I wanted to build a family with all because she fucking lied!!! 

But alas, my hands are tied. To avoid further engagements from her who causes me to tremble after even just hearing her name (im even trembling writing this, i just really want this off my chest), I have to be silent. For the sake of my peace and for the sake of my sanity. 

TL;DR: Woman forced me to have sex with her then claimed to carry my baby. Almost caused me to unalive myself but a year later, confessed it was all a lie she came up with just to have me. ","She disrupted my life, but later claimed to have lied

Now, I have a girlfriend (25F) at that time and I just laughed at her knowing she was high as hell. Soon after that, i cut her off. 

A few months later, this woman contacted me again, desperate for the work that I did for her because i was the only one who understands the assignments she gives me. Because i have a very low paying job, I reluctantly accepted. 

By this time, my then girlfriend broke up with me because i had, and I quote: ""not a dream for myself in sight."" When I was busting my balls trying to save up for us. (We were together 5 years at that time.) 

Hearing my heartbreak, as I was madly in love with my then girlfriend at the time, my employer (31F) sprung in action. She would send me gifts (the ones she know I really liked), and even sent me to Manila as I have never been to the capital before. She knew I loved history so she took me on a tour around Binondo and museums there. 

She was obsessed with me, and I'm not saying that just to flatter myself, she erected a small shrine for me in her house and offered cocoa on it every single day. I knew because she'd send me pictures that she did it even when i didn't want her doing any of that. 

That said, she also knew that I take utang na loob very seriously. She knows how I was taught to always repay the good things given to me, and never take revenge or hold a grudge if offended. 

After Manila, she stayed in my house for a few days because she wanted to celebrate her birthday in my city. (She lives in Cotabato for work). I offered her my room while I slept in the living room. 

One night, she texted me to come to the room and called on the ""utang na loob"" that I incurred upon her. Something happened to us, but it was not something I enjoyed or appreciated. I just laid there while she had her way with me. All the while, I was holding back tears while I thought of my ex at the time. 

Two weeks later, she texted me she was pregnant. My entire world crumbled. I refused to go home because I was sobbing uncontrollably, and I don't want my mother to hear me. Luckily, it was a friday and I was alone in the office for two days. Unluckily, this was the beginning of my descent to darkness. 

I told her I never wanted her, that I was willing to take the baby and raise it alone than to be with her. This is after she gave me an ultimatum that she'd abort the baby if I don't marry her. These conversations and arguments would last for a week and I hid it from everyone. I even began tying a noose for myself (I consider myself an expert in tying a noose, the literal hangman's noose) because i was so defeated.

While I was battling that woman and myself, my then ex returned out of the blue and told me she still loved me. Even after she belittled me, I still loved her. So i told her everything and she decided to accept me. 

Meanwhile, before this other woman would know my ex returned, she claimed to have had a miscarriage. 

Now, when she learnes my ex returned, the other woman wouldn't accept that, she wanted me so bad that she contacted my then girlfriend and told her lies about me. Our work meetings which were usually just me and her in a public place got turned to us going to a motel together. My then gf believed her more, even when I tried to explain.

I had to quit my job to preserve the image of the organization (I worked in an NGO that preserved women's and children's rights). She claimed that I defamed her because i told my then GF that ""I felt like I was raped."" (Take note, I know it wasn't constituted as rape, but as I was forced to do it, I felt like I was taken advantage of like that.) and further threatened to sue me for it. 

I tried to hang myself again. But I found that I couldn't do it because I'd leave my mother alone, not to mention my dogs who adore me. But I would just sit quietly and feel like i was having a heart attack because I was anxious of everything. 

I let the other woman be, and gave her everything she wanted, even drafting and signing an NDA that says we can never speak about it again because her reputation was tainted. I was humiliated in my previous bosses and her bosses who knows me because of the partnerships our organizations had before. 

My then GF and I would be together for another few months, I even gave her a promise ring because i really wanted to marry her at the time before she'd use all those things against me over and over again, when she, herself kissed another married man while we were still together, but kept it as a secret for so long. 

We broke up and my world crumbled again. I fought for her, appealed to how we grew up together, but she wouldn't have it. She'd rather ghost me than accept me again. So I finally stopped. 

That was 5 months ago. I got better, focusing on the fact that, I survived it all.

That is, until yesterday when my previous employer texted me. The following is the message she sent: 


""Hey its me. I ended things with anger and hate, and I just want you to know I regreted being that way. Ive been finally okay. Im happy. And since Ive been calm and regulated, I think I can finally say this- You deserve the truth. There wasnt any baby. Im sorry you have to find out this way.

Have a happy life. I wish you roses.
-D.""

She's more sorry I found out this way than being sorry she lied. 

I was taught not to harbor any ill will towards anyone, and I'm known to have immaculate patience. But I can't just fucking take it, she fucking lied! I lost everything, a job i was very much fucking passionate with, a woman I wanted to build a family with all because she fucking lied!!! 

But alas, my hands are tied. To avoid further engagements from her who causes me to tremble after even just hearing her name (im even trembling writing this, i just really want this off my chest), I have to be silent. For the sake of my peace and for the sake of my sanity. 

TL;DR: Woman forced me to have sex with her then claimed to carry my baby. Almost caused me to unalive myself but a year later, confessed it was all a lie she came up with just to have me.

18247,1fpdzr8,post,"I’m still, legally speaking, a minor","I am under court-appointed guardianship. According to state laws, I have no meaningful adult rights and I have essentially the same control over my life as a minor.

It’s somewhat similar to Britney Spears’ situation… but not quite.

I have a full-control “conservatorship” who happens to be a state appointed lawyer. He and his office manage all my finances and finalize housing decisions while taking a small slice of my SSDI.

The disability? My father claimed Asperger’s to received SSDI and pay for “treatment” in a Children’s Home when I was 15 by calling up his lawyer to have a chat with a doctor who worked with me a few years prior. There was no further assessment… just the doc saying, “oh, he’s in treatment? I don’t see why not.”

Then bam… disability claim and Pops didn’t have to pay for the facility.

I keep getting people shitting on me for not “taking responsibility” for my life and telling me “You’re a man. Act like it.” and it sucks. I feel shame, grief, sadness, fear and confusion because how the hell do they not comprehend when I say “I am a ward of the state. The state owns me. I do not have adult rights and capacities.”

I cannot work full-time without repercussions from the guardianship office. I can potentially work part time for, at most, $200-300 per month on top of my disability income.

It’s like everyone has a narrative or plan for everyone they meet and anything unusual is immediately something they hate. I’m “lazy” or I’m “not man enough.”

My father’s a narcissist and he always dances around the claim… never explaining the situation or conditions to anyone… and he’s violent so he periodically flips out and needs to practice “damage control” so I get isolated from the family and have to deal with whatever resources the state can provide… usually overcrowded state-funded complexes or privately owned homes registered as “care facilities” for government subsidies.

Tons of drug use, violence and plenty to fear in those places… convicted criminals, sex offenders, etc.

So yeah… I’d appreciate a little compassion, maybe some curiosity above judgments and maybe a little empathy.

Besides, this situation could wind up with positive gains… I could attend college with my limited income when supported additionally by my somewhat wealthy, successful family. I could start working for my brother-in-law who runs a successful small business with his family that’s been in operation for decades… or my cousin’s place where they’ve been selling glasses frames for 40 years.

There’s plenty of possibilities if people let the fuck go of their determined pride and accept the pain they just might be causing.","I’m still, legally speaking, a minor I am under court-appointed guardianship.

18248,1fkeluf,post,I was caught in a sting operation ,"Throw away account for obvious reasons. This happened over a decade ago in my early 20's. My mom had died 6 months earlier and I wasn't handling it well. I barely left the house, I started pulling out my hair and almost never showered. I had just narrowly avoided becoming homeless so I was looking on Craigslist for a hookup for stress relief (I did this regularly but with the exception of one time, nothing ever came of it). I came across an ad about a dad looking for guidance for his daughter. It was weird but I replied. You can pretty much guess what happened next. Looking back at it, there were so many tells this was a cop but I was stupid and not in the right frame of mind. So we agreed to meet up at a gas station and I was arrested.

 The next six months were crazy. My older brother who was living with me at the time bailed me out the next day but said he couldn't live with me anymore. I moved to a new apartment while going through my case. I didn't even get a plea deal until I got a psychosexual evaluation. The evaluation showed that I had normal sexual attraction for an adult man. After that I got a plea deal of 30 days in jail, 5 years probation with sex offender restrictions, mandatory therapy and they would withhold adjudication. I only served 3 weeks before I was released. After I was released I pretty much did nothing for a year and a half, just living off of money my mom left me. Eventually my brother moved back in with me along with my cousin. The money was running out and it was really hard finding a job. I did get one in retail right when shit was about to hit the fan. Around that time my brother moved out again so it was just me and my cousin for a few years. Everything was fine until my lease was up after 3 years and the new rent was way outside my range. My cousin found a place for himself while I lived in a shared room air bnb for a year. One of the conditions of my probation was no internet access, which I routinely broke, that's how I got the air bnb and how I got my job. I literally couldn't live without the internet. By the end of one year in the air bnb I had found a single room to rent and my probation was done in 2 months. I eventually rented the whole house and am still there now.

I started off in individual therapy but that was too expensive so I transferred to group therapy. Everyone else in the group was an actual sex offender but they weren't the stereotypes you see in the media. They acted like regular people and the majority of them were victims of some type of abuse when they were kids. That therapy gave me so many tools in life that I still use today when dealing with mental or emotional issues. 

I don't talk about this often and most people don't know. My brother and 2 of my cousins are the only family members that know. My best friend and another older friend know. I eventually told some of my closer co-workers and they treat me no differently. I feared when I told people they would freak out or treat me like garbage. I based that off of how the internet reacts when this type of stuff comes up. Every person I told pretty much just said “oh” and treated me no different. Most of the time I forget it even happened. The only time I really remember it is when I think about the future. What will future partners think? What happens if I want to move or get a new job, will it hinder me? I think of starting a YouTube channel, will someone find out and destroy me? What if I can't have children and want to adopt, is that impossible? Even with everything I've been through and the questions I have, this situation made me a better person. It forced me to grow up fast and gave me invaluable tools that I will never forget. Its almost to the point where if I could go back in time to prevent myself from falling for it, I would actually have to think. I don't even really know why I'm posting this. I guess I just needed to get it off my chest since I never really talk about it.

18250,1fan4x4,post,"UPDATE II: I think my husband fathered his best friend's children, and now one of them is attracted to my daughter. ","(You can find the original posts on my account page, Reddit won't let me link them.)



I didn’t expect to have another update so quickly, but after posting my first update I did a lot of thinking about my kids. I ultimately decided that whatever else happened, I needed to warn Sophie about the situation, and do so immediately. To hell with Luke and whatever that meant for him. To hell if that meant all of the kids learned of the situation. She needed to be aware of what she might be getting herself into. 



So I discreetly kept her out of school. We went back home, to our home, last night, and this morning, I dropped everyone off and saved Sophie for last, before driving right past her school and telling her that we needed to talk. Always a frightening thing for a teenager to hear from a parent, but I was quick to establish that she was not in trouble, but she needed to know the truth about why Amy and I were fighting, why her dating Tom was out of the question. I very gently explained that because of Luke’s closeness to Amy and Tom’s resemblance to him, I had come to suspect that perhaps Luke and Amy were intimate at some point over the years. If that was true, and there was any chance Tom’s father was actually Luke, that would be a significant problem. 



Sophie was quiet during all of this, and even after I had stopped talking to let her respond, she paused for quite a while, before she finally said that we needed to get Tom and discuss this with him as well. I had no objections, so she texted him to meet with us. They’re both skipping school today, but Sophie gets straight As and this is extremely important, so I looked the other way. Tom came to meet us, and Sophie had me relay what I told her to him as well. I apologized to him for any indication I might have given that I didn’t think he was “good enough” for my daughter, and to both of them for not telling the truth sooner. 



Tom and Sophie just gave each other this oddly knowing stare.



And, Reddit, that’s when they blew my mind. 



Sophie spoke first, with Tom backing her up. They revealed to me that in fact, they had already known about Luke and Amy, or at least they had strongly suspected. Apparently Tom has overheard conversations that are…questionable. As well as overhearing the sounds of sex from Amy’s room, sounds he would just as soon forget, but all signs point to Amy’s lover having been Luke. Tom had wondered for a very long time, and back in January, he finally voiced his fears to Sophie. She agreed with them. She could also see a strange sort of closeness between her father and his mother. They agreed that Luke was likely having an affair. They agreed that, because of Kaylee’s allergy, Luke might very well be her father. And if Kaylee was Luke’s daughter, the rest of Tom’s siblings could be Luke’s as well. Tom could be Luke’s kid himself. The math led them to the same places as me. 



So Sophie and Tom came up with a little plan. As it turns out, they are not in love! They never were. They’re still just best friends. But they had the same instinct as me, that they didn’t want to blow up our entire family and social unit without more direct evidence (which Tom has been working on acquiring) and though Sophie very badly wanted to tell me the truth, she was hesitant because she knew it would shatter me. She had no idea I was already suffering in silence. Sophie apologized for not voicing her suspicions sooner. Honestly, we both cried, and I made sure she understood that none of this was her fault, and that I loved her very much. 



So, the bottom line is, Sophie and Tom already know they could be half-siblings and aren’t actually interested in being a couple. That was their idea for how to rock the boat. To force Luke and Amy to do something about the situation rather than just keep making a fool out of me. I also think it was Tom/Sophie’s way of punishing them for their affair. Teenagers can be vindictive. So they concocted this idea that they wanted to date. Every flirtation I’ve witnessed, every inappropriate touch - all staged, apparently, and for the benefit of Luke, Amy, or both. This was supposed to make them sweat and Sophie/Tom expected they would jump out of their seats to forbid it from happening. When I was the one who did instead, that kind of threw the kids for a loop. They couldn’t understand why I cared more than the actual cheaters. They began to suspect that maybe I knew. Tom confronting me that one time about “Why can’t I date Sophie” was him trying to gauge if I knew or not. 



Maybe I shouldn’t be surprised. Sophie and Tom have always been close friends and confided in each other. Maybe I should be a little more concerned at how sneaky they’ve been, but honestly I’m just so relieved they’re not dating. (Sure, they could be lying to throw off the scent, I guess, but they apparently already knew that they’re likely related, they didn’t blink at all when I told them.) We even had a bit of a laugh together when Tom mentioned how he had been “a little offended” that I was so against him dating my daughter before. I kind of jokingly asked him, “So you don’t think she’s gorgeous?” And Tom, bless his heart, shrugged it off. “She is. But so is my English Teacher, and I’m not asking her out either.” 



Either way, the question now is…where to go from here? We have to figure that out. I will say that it is such a relief to have told Sophie and I feel like an elephant has taken one of its feet off my chest. Having her in my corner, and Tom in my corner as well, means a lot to me, and even though I basically just got it absolutely confirmed that Luke is sleeping with Amy…I kind of already knew that anyway. So now it’s just a question of how to proceed. Tom has already volunteered to submit his DNA so I can compare it to Luke’s, and both he and Sophie advise me not to tell Luke and Amy when I do this, which I agree with. They’re both completely on my side, which means more to me than I can ever express to them. Tom has also been trying to set up a camera in Amy’s room to catch her and Luke in the act. Sophie told me flat out that I needed to divorce her Dad, and hearing that from my own daughter made it clearer than it’s ever been. She’s right. ","UPDATE II: I think my husband fathered his best friend's children, and now one of them is attracted to my daughter.

Tom confronting me that one time about “Why can’t I date Sophie” was him trying to gauge if I knew or not. 



Maybe I shouldn’t be surprised. Sophie and Tom have always been close friends and confided in each other. Maybe I should be a little more concerned at how sneaky they’ve been, but honestly I’m just so relieved they’re not dating. (Sure, they could be lying to throw off the scent, I guess, but they apparently already knew that they’re likely related, they didn’t blink at all when I told them.) We even had a bit of a laugh together when Tom mentioned how he had been “a little offended” that I was so against him dating my daughter before. I kind of jokingly asked him, “So you don’t think she’s gorgeous?” And Tom, bless his heart, shrugged it off. “She is. But so is my English Teacher, and I’m not asking her out either.” 



Either way, the question now is…where to go from here? We have to figure that out. I will say that it is such a relief to have told Sophie and I feel like an elephant has taken one of its feet off my chest. Having her in my corner, and Tom in my corner as well, means a lot to me, and even though I basically just got it absolutely confirmed that Luke is sleeping with Amy…I kind of already knew that anyway. So now it’s just a question of how to proceed. Tom has already volunteered to submit his DNA so I can compare it to Luke’s, and both he and Sophie advise me not to tell Luke and Amy when I do this, which I agree with. They’re both completely on my side, which means more to me than I can ever express to them. Tom has also been trying to set up a camera in Amy’s room to catch her and Luke in the act. Sophie told me flat out that I needed to divorce her Dad, and hearing that from my own daughter made it clearer than it’s ever been. She’s right. ",13227,2197,2024-09-06 19:04,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1fan4x4/update_ii_i_think_my_husband_fathered_his_best/,Neutral
18251,1faa9xw,post,Falling in love with my husband’s best friend after having regular threesomes and I don’t know what to do about it ,"So the story starts a few years ago when me (32F) and my husband (35M) sort of fell into swinging with my husband’s best friend (34M) and his gf. We had a fun time for a year or so, sometimes we would all have sex together, sometimes we would wife swap, sometimes just the girls would have sex while the guys watched etc. All harmless fun. Then my husband’s friend we’ll call him Josh, and his gf broke up. 
Josh, husband and I decided we still wanted to have sex so kept hooking up just the three of us. 
Then my husband got a job that requires him to be away a couple of weeks at a time. I asked husband if I could still hang out platonically with Josh, for coffee etc. and hubby said yes no probs, he’s your friend too. 
There has been no sex involved during these times, I have no desire to cheat on my husband.
But now that we have been spending more  time together I feel like I am falling for Josh. I’m not falling out of love with my husband though, and I don’t want to hurt him or offend him but I do kinda want to bring it up with him how I’m feeling. I’m so confused and don’t really know what to do. Am I just feeling this way because I’m sexually attracted to Josh? Will I be risking my marriage if I tell my husband I’m in love with his best friend too? Could I somehow date them both without anyone getting hurt or is that a stupid idea? In hindsight we probably shouldn’t have continued fucking just the three of us, I should have realised that catching feelings is inevitable if you’re having good sex and craving more of it.

18252,1evzpjw,post,I can't lose weight and I wish doctors could believe me,"Tw: mentions of anorexia beaten years ago, eating disorders.




Growing up I had a bad relationship with food and had to beat anorexia twice when I was 5 and 6. I turned 8 years old and ballooned to being overweight while eating a balanced diet from the nutritionists and ED doctors that were treating me recommended I try. It was food I enjoyed but was healthy. I was eating more vegetables and fruit than other kids at that point, and the food was to help me gain to a healthy weight, and it did, not sure what weight it was at 5-7 years but I remember my BMI being right in the middle of healthy for that time in my life. The diet went as followed : 1 egg for breakfast, no lunch as I hated eating at school, and a healthy steamed chicken dinner with all sorts of greens and veggies I liked like carrots and red peppers included. The portions were great for my age too. I was okay with eating the same thing every day and still am to this day.

 all of a sudden, eating small portions and healthy food for 2 years, I hadn't ever really even touched a sweet as they made me feel sick, I gained almost overnight to have a morbidly obese BMI. My parents didn't seem to care. My parents were even told by the doctors that I must be sneaking downstairs at night and eating food when it was not true. My mom even felt offended that the doctors thought she isn't able to keep track of what's in the fridge. 

I stayed like that until I was about 12. I walked to school and back everyday, played during break in school and even started trying the treadmill at home as my weight was bothering me, I never strayed off my diet and started eating half the portions even. When I was 12, I had enough of the weight and went on one of the worst ""diets"" a 12 year old or even an adult could do. I ate once a day at 3pm. 1 butter sandwich and yogurt. 500 calories. And I lost the weight. Down from 80kgs at 11, to 49kg.

Then at 13, the diet left me tired and I started strayed off it and went back to my normal one with the addition of sweets and fast food (i never really ate it as a child so I was just tasting how addictive those foods were) I gained back up to 84kgs.

At 15 I went back to what I called the 500cal diet with exercise this time. I was got to 60kgs that time. Behind the scenes of my weight happiness was hunger, tons of hunger. Then I was left by my now ex back then who did something horrible to me. I lost my appetite for a few weeks then gained it back with a catch, I only felt hungry for ice cream and nuttela pancakes for almost a year before going back to normal food. Spiked to 86kg which is where I am now all those years later. 

I've tried it all. Exercise, gym memberships as going there makes me more motivated than at home,10,000 steps a day even on rest days. Pescetarian diet, less portions, no fast food, no sweets, less portion but same homemade food I make (I make chicken like sweet and sour, kung pao at home with rice, noodles. Sometimes I make battered cod at home with rice, casserole with ham and cheese, obviously for that eat tiny portions), gluten-free, less oil, I switched to never adding salt to my dishes. Nothing has worked and I've had to endure people saying I'm lying. That I'm a binge eater that lies to people about what I eat for sympathy. Ive been constantly told I'm a liar by any doctor I tell that weight loss is only a task I can do by going back on that horrible 500cal diet. I swear even toddlers eat more than 500cal a day.

I have been told that I might have hypothyroidism. It runs in my family as my Grandma, Auntie and (possibly) cousin has it. The symptoms I have are obviously the weight gain, the puffy face that stays no matter what I do, the bloating, the 3pm crashes I have, loss of sex drive, the thinning hair and nails, the deep hoarse voice ive always had, the mental and physical slowness and brain fog. I'm just scared to do the test though. I'm scared about that if it's not hypothyroidism, I will never know what it actually is. I will just blame myself and my diet and force myself to live eating less than my birds do. 

Right now I eat unsweeted coffee for breakfast, and then cod fish battered with jasmine rice. Nothing else for the day and I'm 86kg. I use the treadmill daily for an hour, which does some steps and burns 300cal. Daily since last year. On ""cheat days"" I have a chocolate milk once a few weeks. Refuse to eat from fast food restaurants too. All the  daily food I eat doesn't require oil to cook and I never salt it extra by hand.

I don't want weight loss tips as this isn't the subreddit for it, and I've tried everything already. I just wish people could listen to me and really believe that I have tried everything. I wish doctors would try and see maybe there is a problem, maybe some food intolerance or stomach, gut problem causing slow metabolism and weight gain. But they push me away with their diagnosis of liar. Maybe it's just my GP though, they were never helpful. And don't try any of the ""500cal diets"" I described here. They are YoYo diets that will make you so sick of eating like that you will bounce back as if you never even lost the weight. They are useless and tiring and will end you in hospital like I had to be in twice for extreme weakness where i could barely breathe. I'm so mentally exhausted from the way people treat me as someone who can't lose weight but looks bigger.

18253,1evv62v,post,My mother is not a good person,"There. Said it.

I actively dislike my mother and do not respect either parent. I am honestly SICK of that woman. She is a controlling, disrespectful and utterly self-absorbed creature. Despite what everyone says about FaMiLY, she isn't it. Here's some of the highlights over the last 2 decades:

* Lied about the true cause of my uncle's passing. My uncle passed away from a form of Cancer. She just said it was complications from a long standing issue with his teeth. On top of that, my aunt later unalived herself and my cousin had to be sent into State care due to a psychotic break. The woman hid all of this.
* I have no relationship with anyone else in my family. She dislikes her own family and looked own on one of her brothers because he chose not to have kids. Only people she chooses to keep in touch with are some very old relatives who rely on her for getting stuff done. I have no memories of cousins like normal people. I only realised this when I went to University.
* Anything about being a woman, dressing, personal grooming, hygiene, sex I had to learn from the internet or from friends. My friends never understood why I don't know how to wear certain garments or makeup. My mother wouldn't even buy me my own clothes till my brother went to University. But if anyone ever compliments me, she takes it as what a good parent she is.
* She does no sort of personal improvement. Us kids never needed extra tutoring, we used to handle our own schoolwork and were good at it. So when we started school, she would have had plenty of time for herself. Yet all she did was watch sensation news and reality TV. She gets agitated if one of use watches TV and she wants to. I stopped watching TV thanks to her. She has no hobbies, no friends. I think she spoke badly about some people she used to work out with so now she has no one.
* She constantly wants someone around. Not to talk to but talk at. She constantly has to talk and comment and share her opinion. Just her opinion. When someone is driving or working or whatever. She has to be heard and acknowledged. But never corrected. She is always right even when wrong.
* She has never encouraged my hobbies and always sees me having a social life as a bad thing and doesn't like it if I go visit friends. Yet she expects my friends to be up and willing to help whenever and if I needed something. She has no friends and mocks me when I text my friends.
* She does not respect the fact that I have to work from home and also do my own housework. To her, sitting at a computer isn't really work. She thinks the housework she does and the exact way she does it is best. Truth is she is inefficient. 
* She complains how no one cares about her or respects her. But in truth she cares for no one. Not even herself. She wears badly fitted clothes and feels the need to give her opinion at every point. I cannot go to a shop or doctor without this woman feeling the need to insert herself into the situation. I am in my 30s and have lived abroad for years now. She still barges into everything and knows nothing but doesn't shut up. I pay for myself but I am so embarrassed by this woman. 
* She cannot bear to be corrected or contradicted. She immediately becomes hostile and can start screaming at you. She only interacts with tradepeople and older people who can't talk back. 
* She has constantly told me how much she sacrificed by giving up her career to raise her kids. How much she regrets that. I don't want to ever have kids or even marry or be in a relationship because I might become her. 
* If she were to see this, she would just be offended and cry about how ungrateful I am. That I am lying. 

I don't want sympathy. I just needed to vent. I am so tired of this creature. I am unfortunately in my home country for a wedding and had to stay at the house. ","My mother is not a good person There. Said it.

18255,1ertw04,post,"I’m dying, so I’m finally speaking to NC/LC family members ","TLDR: I (23FtM) have lymphoma, so I’m dying. I had a really shitty upbringing due to my family and their “friends”, cut a lot of them off, and am now doing the rounds of reaching out to explain everything they’ve done. I’m not telling any of them that I’m dying, I just want to know if they ever realized what they put me through. 

As far as the cancer goes… it sucks. With treatment, it looks like maybe a few very miserable years. Without treatment, about a year, give or take a few months. I’ve always had friends remark that I’m much more optimistic and outgoing than they’d expect after getting to know me well enough, but in all reality, that’s just my autopilot. I’m just opting for pain management with minimal treatment so I can feel like I’m truly living for the next year or so. But I don’t want to live a life with all of these painful memories and mental scars. If I hadn’t gotten sick, those scars likely would’ve healed over time, but I just don’t have any fight left in me anymore. 

My sister (25F): Bailey is my half sister, my only sibling on my dad’s side. She often acted resentful of me for having both parents in my life, despite how abusive my mom was to all of her kids. I’d much rather have just our dad take care of me, but there’s no explaining that coherently as a kid. Our dad worked long hours to make ends meet and give us an enjoyable life at his house, which meant we were alone at home a lot. She’d often invite boys over when he was gone, usually 3+ years older than her, which made them 5+ years older than me. Our dad didn’t allow that, but she prevented me from snitching by claiming that our dad would lose visitation rights over me, so I’d be stuck with my mom. Her “boyfriends” would force themselves on me when she wasn’t around. Once, as a kid, one of her friend’s mom dragged me into a van to drive me home, and I still get nervous walking around in the town I lived in at the time. She ran away from home at 18, got arrested in the state over, and dragged our dad’s name through the mud by attempting to press child abuse charges against him so he’d stop trying to reach out to her. Guess who was stuck dealing with a grieving father every other weekend and got to join for the car ride to get her from the police station in the middle of the night? She popped back up about a year later at my high school, claimed I harassed her, and almost got me expelled despite being an honor student. She apparently doesn’t remember most of this, and seemed truly apologetic. Bailey wants to make amends, but isn’t willing to have a sit down with our dad where we explain all of these things. 

My dad: I grew up looking up to him and admiring his work ethic. He is what I’d describe as a great guy with a wonderful sense of humor and very friendly. He fought for years to gain full custody of my older sister, Bailey, due to her mom being an abusive addict. When I was 8, he and my mom divorced. She was abusive to him, so he signed whatever he had to in order to achieve the quickest possible divorce. Including her getting primary custody. It feels like he just didn’t have the same energy to put into fighting for me as he did for my sister, despite knowing how my mom would treat me. He never asked what my home life was like at my mom’s and actively avoiding talking about her. I didn’t get to learn how to do household chores or how to cook because he was either working or wanting to do fun activities when I was at his house. When my mom kicked me out at 15, he claimed I couldn’t move in due to his girlfriend adjusting to moving in, which was later revealed as blatant transphobia on her part. Yes, they’re still together. He apologized many times and we both cried during that conversation. I reach out to him more often than I used to (about once a month), and he’s stopped texting me on a weekly routine. 

My mother: boy howdy there’s so much to unpack here that I likely will eventually type out in an email to send her. She was mentally and physically abusive, frequently brought her children around her New boyfriends, and had us spend the night with her at her friend Tank’s house. Fun fact, Tank is a registered sex offender, specifically involving several children. When I was 18 and on a hookup app, he messaged me on there for ‘help’ with a specific type of ‘problem’. I told her about it, and she claimed someone catfished his crusty ancient ass. Aight. When I came out as trans, she changed the locks on me and claimed I killed her daughter (metaphorically). When I met with her recently, I started by explaining that I’m seriously sick and it’s not looking great. She called it karma for killing her little girl so many years ago. I left and don’t plan to reach back out. Today is her birthday, and it sucks that I can’t stop thinking about her. 

Please know that I have a lot of friends that care about me, several siblings I haven’t mentioned who I am on good terms with, and plan to surround myself with loved ones until my final day. 
","I’m dying, so I’m finally speaking to NC/LC family members  TLDR: I (23FtM) have lymphoma, so I’m dying. I had a really shitty upbringing due to my family and their “friends”, cut a lot of them off, and am now doing the rounds of reaching out to explain everything they’ve done. I’m not telling any of them that I’m dying, I just want to know if they ever realized what they put me through. 

As far as the cancer goes… it sucks. With treatment, it looks like maybe a few very miserable years. Without treatment, about a year, give or take a few months. I’ve always had friends remark that I’m much more optimistic and outgoing than they’d expect after getting to know me well enough, but in all reality, that’s just my autopilot. I’m just opting for pain management with minimal treatment so I can feel like I’m truly living for the next year or so. But I don’t want to live a life with all of these painful memories and mental scars. If I hadn’t gotten sick, those scars likely would’ve healed over time, but I just don’t have any fight left in me anymore. 

My sister (25F): Bailey is my half sister, my only sibling on my dad’s side. She often acted resentful of me for having both parents in my life, despite how abusive my mom was to all of her kids. I’d much rather have just our dad take care of me, but there’s no explaining that coherently as a kid. Our dad worked long hours to make ends meet and give us an enjoyable life at his house, which meant we were alone at home a lot. She’d often invite boys over when he was gone, usually 3+ years older than her, which made them 5+ years older than me. Our dad didn’t allow that, but she prevented me from snitching by claiming that our dad would lose visitation rights over me, so I’d be stuck with my mom. Her “boyfriends” would force themselves on me when she wasn’t around. Once, as a kid, one of her friend’s mom dragged me into a van to drive me home, and I still get nervous walking around in the town I lived in at the time. She ran away from home at 18, got arrested in the state over, and dragged our dad’s name through the mud by attempting to press child abuse charges against him so he’d stop trying to reach out to her. Guess who was stuck dealing with a grieving father every other weekend and got to join for the car ride to get her from the police station in the middle of the night? She popped back up about a year later at my high school, claimed I harassed her, and almost got me expelled despite being an honor student. She apparently doesn’t remember most of this, and seemed truly apologetic. Bailey wants to make amends, but isn’t willing to have a sit down with our dad where we explain all of these things. 

My dad: I grew up looking up to him and admiring his work ethic. He is what I’d describe as a great guy with a wonderful sense of humor and very friendly. He fought for years to gain full custody of my older sister, Bailey, due to her mom being an abusive addict. When I was 8, he and my mom divorced. She was abusive to him, so he signed whatever he had to in order to achieve the quickest possible divorce. Including her getting primary custody. It feels like he just didn’t have the same energy to put into fighting for me as he did for my sister, despite knowing how my mom would treat me. He never asked what my home life was like at my mom’s and actively avoiding talking about her. I didn’t get to learn how to do household chores or how to cook because he was either working or wanting to do fun activities when I was at his house. When my mom kicked me out at 15, he claimed I couldn’t move in due to his girlfriend adjusting to moving in, which was later revealed as blatant transphobia on her part. Yes, they’re still together. He apologized many times and we both cried during that conversation. I reach out to him more often than I used to (about once a month), and he’s stopped texting me on a weekly routine. 

My mother: boy howdy there’s so much to unpack here that I likely will eventually type out in an email to send her. She was mentally and physically abusive, frequently brought her children around her New boyfriends, and had us spend the night with her at her friend Tank’s house. Fun fact, Tank is a registered sex offender, specifically involving several children. When I was 18 and on a hookup app, he messaged me on there for ‘help’ with a specific type of ‘problem’.

But it seemed nice enough. I looked a little more into it after my husband had made an offer ( I didn't want to in the moment but I didn't speak up loud enough to stop him) and found out that there are three whole sex offenders near us and after looking further into the street behind us it's a lot more sketch than we initially thought. (One boarded up house, and one burnt down house) 

Weirdly enough the houses on our street are well kept and nice so idk what the hell is going on back there but I don't think I would feel safe there by myself at night with my daughter and I grew up in the methiest trailer park imaginable. 

I've talked to my husband about it until I've gotten blue in the face and I get the vibe that he thinks I'm being dramatic. We've already sunk so much money into this house already and he's very fiscally minded so I get why he doesn't want to give up this house but I really don't feel like I'm going to be safe there. I keep telling him that I'm getting anxious and sick to my stomach over it and he just brushes it off. 

So now I'm here, I'm probably going to hate living there and lose sleep at night because I feel unsafe. 

I've already bought security cameras. I'm thinking about getting a gnarly looking dog and keeping a gun in the house but there isn't much I can do now.

18258,1efum4j,post,I feel like I'm going crazy.,"\*\*Warning long post\*\*

I have nobody to talk to about any of this, and I'm starting to feel like if I don't get this all out I'm gonna go crazy. Everything bad started happening years ago when my fiance (now husband) and I moved away from NYS to go to WA state. I thought it was going to be a great change and I was excited at first, I had just had our first baby and we were good and happy and had all these plans for when we arrived in WA. Well, immediately those plans fell apart, my husband had promised me I would be able to stay at home for a little while as a SAHM while he worked as a masseuse since I'd been working hard to save up for this move. Well, I thought he had everything set for transferring his massage license while I did all the work of securing a place for us before we moved, he hadn't. He thought he could magically do it when we got there without informing me of that, so he was unable to get a job. I had to scramble to make sure we were financially okay and quickly got a job in 5 days to support us (my sister had moved with us as well and she couldn't seem to get a job either.) I had to do overtime almost every day to keep up on the bills, and I barely saw my son, which killed me. But because of this, my husband fell into a depression, instead of looking for other work or working on transferring his massage license he just gave up while I took on the load of supporting our family. 

Well, it just started going downhill from here. He decided to reconnect with an ex-girlfriend at first, his first love as he said, seeming to need to resolve things with her after almost ten years and didn't care that we were engaged and had a child together and I was doing everything I could for us. I found out and started having arguments with him telling him that it made me feel so disrespected, and all he did was gaslight me like I was crazy. 

Well, that was just the start of it. He hid all communication from me with his ex, and started befriending lots of women in our new area and hiding those messages from me as well. I had also become pregnant with our second child. Eventually, he got a job almost after a year, which allowed me to stay home since I was about to give birth to our second child, and I had saved up enough money to pay for his massage license transfer which would take a while but was still coming, and I felt like things were finally getting better. 

We were happy for almost 2 years, he wasn't depressed anymore, I thought he had stopped communicating with his ex and all these other women, I was blissfully unaware. It was close to my daughter's 2nd birthday when he decided he wanted to fly his cousin out to visit us for the entire summer and without discussing it with me quit his job to hang with his cousin all summer long. I had to quickly scramble again and get a job because we did not have the finances for him to do that. I got a job just in time for us to cover rent, while he took the rest of my first paycheck to pay for his cousin's plane ticket. And somehow this became me ruining his summer cause he now had to watch our children while I worked. 

Well anyway, after that I decided I would just keep my job to make sure I knew we always had money coming in and I didn't have to worry. Eventually, he got his massage license and started working which finally allowed us to have a good amount of income coming in. We were in a good spot, again. Then through his massage job he befriended a client, that he did a private massage for, who was not the best person in the world. And this is where we met a girl that nearly ruined our marriage. (this happened over the course of a couple years) my husband had found other female massage therapists that he decided was alright to become inappropriate with, and then this woman, let's call her Chelsey, kept asking him to do all these things for her late at night, which I had voiced made me really uncomfortable, but he didn't care. Well one night, she had asked him for a massage, late at night, and the massage became very inappropriate. Well, I didn't know anything about it until the cops showed up at our doorstep telling me that Chelsey had filed charges against my husband, saying that he had done stuff to her that she hadn't wanted. I asked him about it and he denied everything and lied right to my face. 

Me, wanting to believe him and chose to believe everything he told me. Then I suddenly became very sick and was hospitalized and almost died. My husband was being so great to me again and I felt like things were good again, and nothing seemed to come up from the cops again. Well, I was naive. Months later everything resurfaced, and I quickly found out that my husband had lied to me about everything when he had to hire a lawyer. He tried to hid it from me, but I checked his email to his lawyer explaining to them everything that had happened. I was heartbroken. The lawyer fees took all the savings we had, and I had to be his main character reference to tell the courts he was a good person, and that broke me a lot inside after finding out what he'd done. Right after this I was hospitalized again because I hadn't recovered fully, and I was incredibly sick. I told him I couldn't stay in WA state any longer and wanted to move back to NYS, since I believed my mother needed me since we found out my father had been abusing their adopted daughter. He agreed, and he had to attend therapy for sex offenders out in NY as per ordered by the court. 

I thought we could start to recover from all of this when we distanced ourselves and moved back to NY and had family close by to help us. Boy was I wrong... While still recovering from what my husband had done, me and him trying to fix our marriage from all the damage he'd done, I found out my father was not my father (Thanks 23 and me) I decided to discuss this with my mother. My mother decided to take an extreme route for me finding out and cut me out of her life, calling me ungrateful. I had nearly lost my marriage, and then I'd lost my family, and I was pregnant again (a bad decision believing a child would help fix our marriage.) I felt like I was losing my mind. 

Now present, my husband showed a big effort in fixing our marriage after he had to go to therapy and coming to the realization of what he'd put me and our kids through. I thought that we finally in a good place again, and I relied on him to help me get through the pain from my mother. He suddenly had become a rock for me, but after 2 years of living in NYS, getting over things and healing, and believing we were finally moving on with our lives, my husband has decided to regress to how he was before. I feel like he doesn't care about me anymore, and nothing I can ever do will change it. I have tried and tried over the 16 years we've been together, but I just don't know if I have the energy to try anymore. I have loved him so deeply throughout the years that I feel like I have lost myself, I have always wanted him to be better and I really wanted to be the one to help him get there, but I don't know if I can do it any longer and I've been trying to figure out if I want to break up our family for the sake of my happiness or just ride it out until the kids are old enough to understand. Every moment with him hasn't been bad, I have many amazing memories with him that have kept me here, but I also feel like any change he makes that's positive only lasts for a couple of years before he stops, and I don't think he'll ever change for the better for me and the kids. 

If anyone actually made it this far, thank you, thank you for reading about my life. I still might not know what to do, but I know I'll get there eventually, and one day maybe I'll be brave enough to find myself again and put my happiness first. But for today, I just needed to get this all off my chest.  ","I feel like I'm going crazy. \*\*Warning long post\*\*

There are a series of homes my guardian works with near Detroit owned by a Rene Butler in which residents are still given smoking rooms and while the rules claim “no drugs” allow residents alcohol and weed. In one of them, I shared a room with a violent sex offender.

At another home I resided in for less than 24 hours before my mother got me out, a caregiver named “Uncle Steve” lit up a blunt to “bond with the new guy.”

The basement had an Xbox and a half dozen men smoking weed with joints filling an ashtray. Upstairs, a half dozen women were in a bedroom, possibly doing the same thing and dismissing me saying they were “having a staff meeting.”

10 years of Boy Scouts did not prepare me for 10 years of... this.

18260,1edq8nn,post,I fell in love and didn't even know it,"When I was in middle school I met this girl we’ll call Christine for the sake of anonymity. We met when she was sitting beside me in class and I saw she was drawing. Being the cocky little shit I was back then, I decided to copy what she was drawing on my own paper when she noticed and asked if I liked drawing too. As soon as she did, I felt myself freeze up and begin to stutter, but she didn’t seem offended or upset in the slightest bit and so we laughed it off, kicking off the beginnings of a soon to be fulfilling and life changing friendship for me. 

We’d spend most of our time getting to know each other either in class or lunch where she shared with me her favorite interests such as musicals, Voltron, Bo Burnham, Vines, and her favorite music artists. She was extremely talented at drawing, as mentioned earlier, and singing as well as it seemed like she couldn’t let a second of silence go by past the two of us without filling it with the soft sounds of her melodic humming. Not that I ever complained; I loved listening to her. She loved acting and was a part of the school’s theatre club and would even audition for parts outside of the club at the local theatre in my town. Upon looking back, I’m a bit bummed that I never attended any of the times she invited me to go see her. Regardless, I remember being so enthralled with her that I found myself listening to her favorite musicals and artists religiously so we’d have more to talk about and become closer. Hell, I even made her a collage of all of her favorite interests and hobbies for her birthday, something which I had put so much effort into because I knew she would see it and wanted her to be happy about it. While this might not seem like a big deal to some people, it was for me as I don’t remember being so excited and passionate in my other friendships  to the extent where I dedicated so much time and effort to strengthening and maintaining our bond. 

Sometime during our relationship, she told me she was bisexual. To preface this next part, I didn’t have a clear grasp on my sexuality during this time because up until this point I hadn't experienced any romantic or sexual attraction to anyone and played around with the idea of being asexual as it seemed to suit me at that time. Moreover, I didn’t even know bisexuality was a thing before I met her as I grew up in a strict Catholic household where it seemed sex didn’t exist. It didn’t help that prior to middle school when I began using Wattpad and Quotev to read fanfiction and take romance quizzes about fictional characters that I found myself interested and unknowingly attracted to some of the female fictional characters. I say unknowingly because I did not distinguish my attraction to the male and female characters as being different from each other and simply liked what I liked. However, as I approached middle school, I learned here and there about “the dangers of  homosexuality” from my church which  instilled in me a fear of being gay and being rejected by my friends and family. As a result, my understanding of sexuality and attraction was incredibly limited and it wasn’t until I met Christine that I began questioning my own preferences, albeit the asexual part of my identity which, even then, I felt unsure about as I lied to her about having a crush on some boy in hopes of fitting in.

From here on out, it seemed like how we acted around each other could’ve been interpreted as flirting as we would playfully make dirty jokes amongst ourselves whilst punctuating each joke with a sultry look. Similarly to how I made an effort to indulge myself in her interests and make her gifts, I never made these types of jokes with other friends. Looking back, this type of behavior could’ve been me safely expressing myself under the guise of harmless fooling around between friends, but I digress. She would also make things for me as well, such as when she handmade me my own copy of  “Milk and Vine” using computer paper and string, and when she gifted me cookies she baked for my birthday in tupperware, both of which I still have to this day. I even recall being so overwhelmed with joy when she gifted me the book that I asked if I could hug her–another big deal for me since I’m not the biggest fan of physical contact. 

However, what should’ve been the most obvious sign of my feelings for her was when I found out that she had made out with a girl I disliked at the time and who was also her friend. Now I can’t exactly say who had informed me about this as I get confused between believing she herself told me, her friend she was with told me, or another mutual friend of ours told me. Whatever the case may be, all I could remember at that time when I heard about it was the sudden pang of jealousy and anger I felt in my chest. My emotions were so intense that I recall feeling upset for the entire day and a few days after that; however, I chalked it up to me just hating her friend in attempts to soothe my bruised ego. Flash forward to the end of the school year where our last time seeing each other in person is at our middle school prom before going our separate ways. The actual final interactions I had with her were over Instagram during my freshman year of high school where she sent me something once and said it reminded her of me to which I replied “Thank you for thinking of me <3.”

I’m 20 now and in my sophomore year of college and decided to post this after recently coming to terms with sexuality and the fact that this girl literally changed my life. If it wasn’t for her, I don’t know how long it would’ve been before I found out about bisexuality, let alone accepted that I was bi myself. Moreover, it’s because of her that I actually enjoy listening to musicals on my own and have connected with more queer folk because of it, namely my current core friend group. Even now as I take the time to analyze how I behaved around her, I realize I was very comfortable asking her for help and communicating how I felt, something which is very hard for me to do given my anxiety and the way I was raised; I realize that when I was with her, I never thought about anything else and was able to live in the moment of us just talking and laughing with each other. I felt content just being her friend regardless if I didn’t recognize that I had feelings for her. Additionally, I’ve just realized that the qualities I look for in romantic partners now are the same ones she herself possessed, making her the one that got away in a sense, but a necessary person in my life nonetheless. 

Since our last interactions on Instagram, it seems she may have deleted or moved her account as the one she originally messaged me from no longer exists and because of that, I have lost all contact with her. And to those who might suggest I try searching to find a new account she may have created, I don’t think I’ll go through with it simply because I wouldn’t know how to break it to her that she literally changed my life without putting such an immense amount of pressure on her to reconnect. I can contend with the fact that we’ve both gone our own ways for the better and wish her nothing but the best going forward.","I fell in love and didn't even know it When I was in middle school I met this girl we’ll call Christine for the sake of anonymity. We met when she was sitting beside me in class and I saw she was drawing. Being the cocky little shit I was back then, I decided to copy what she was drawing on my own paper when she noticed and asked if I liked drawing too. As soon as she did, I felt myself freeze up and begin to stutter, but she didn’t seem offended or upset in the slightest bit and so we laughed it off, kicking off the beginnings of a soon to be fulfilling and life changing friendship for me. 

We’d spend most of our time getting to know each other either in class or lunch where she shared with me her favorite interests such as musicals, Voltron, Bo Burnham, Vines, and her favorite music artists. She was extremely talented at drawing, as mentioned earlier, and singing as well as it seemed like she couldn’t let a second of silence go by past the two of us without filling it with the soft sounds of her melodic humming. Not that I ever complained; I loved listening to her. She loved acting and was a part of the school’s theatre club and would even audition for parts outside of the club at the local theatre in my town. Upon looking back, I’m a bit bummed that I never attended any of the times she invited me to go see her. Regardless, I remember being so enthralled with her that I found myself listening to her favorite musicals and artists religiously so we’d have more to talk about and become closer. Hell, I even made her a collage of all of her favorite interests and hobbies for her birthday, something which I had put so much effort into because I knew she would see it and wanted her to be happy about it. While this might not seem like a big deal to some people, it was for me as I don’t remember being so excited and passionate in my other friendships  to the extent where I dedicated so much time and effort to strengthening and maintaining our bond.

18261,1dmagi8,post,I am pretty sure my ex boyfriend was an abusive narcissist and I constantly blame myself for what happened. ,"In case it's needed, TWs for emotional abuse and sexual assault.   
  
During my previous year of college, I met this guy. He seemed fine at first, at least aside from a weird first interaction. He was sweet, and interested, and made sure to let me know how special I was to him. He'd shower me with affection, compliments, praise, and attention. I suspect now that he was love bombing me, and I was wary at first, but I still ended up trusting him. 

We talked for a few months, hung out, and talked frequently, even went on a date. I really started to like him, and we decided to officially start dating at the beginning of the year. Things were fine at first. He seemed to be a good fit. At least, until small red flags started popping up.

The first was him calling me stupid for saying a university should not be run as a business. This hurt my feelings, but I pushed it aside. 

Slowly, the red flags grew. I didn't even really realize how bad they'd gotten until after I broke up with him. He started taking crap about everyone behind their backs, lacked empathy and started acting like he was better than everyone, he mostly talked about himself, and how cool he was. I honestly wonder if he was a sociopath? 

As for the relationship's red flags? He was overly jealous of my male friends, and would accuse me of being obsessed with a man I actually despised. For example, he'd bring him up, I'd reply, and he'd angrily tell me I was clearly obsessed with him. It was flabbergasting. He started doing this with one of my female friends (who is straight yet he refused to believe me) because someone asked him if she and I were a couple. 

I have a tough relationship with my parents as they are both very toxic, far right conservative, and Christian, and I have a lot of trauma and am an atheist, queer, and liberal (all the things they dislike). However, whenever I'd try and talk about my struggles with my ex, he'd cut me off and just go ""I love your parents!"" But he'd only seen them for less than 2 hrs in total. He'd do this with about everything I complained about. Whether major or minor. He'd just overall underplay my concerns and sometimes, like in the case of my parents, he'd challenge me to say something positive about them instead. It felt very demeaning. 

Weirdly, he started trying to convince me to move out of state with him and would also try and keep convincing me to go on wilderness adventures with him. This would have separated me from everyone I already knew and I would be lying if I said I wasn't scared he had a bad motive for this. We'd only been together for a few months.

I was clear I did not like being choked in the bedroom, but he'd still end up choking me until I started tapping him to stop and he'd go ""Oh right you're not into that, that's so weird."" mockingly. This happened several times.  
  
There is one occasion I can definitively say was S/A. The whole situation has become very hazy in my memory and it makes me so angry with myself that I cannot remember everything, but I made it very clear that I didn't want any hickeys on my neck from the beginning. I am in a professional field of study, and don't want to have my sex life appear in my professional life. However, he would constantly jokingly act like he was going to give me one. I would push him away or tell him to stop, and he would. He'd say he liked scaring me. It was weird, but whatever. However, one day he went too far. I remember he went at it hard and I cannot remember what I did. I imagine I probably tried to push him away or get him to stop since I always did, but he held me tight and I ended up with the biggest hickey right on the front of my neck. Nothing would hide it. Not my hair, not my clothes, nothing. He kinda apologized, and I ended up leaving his room soon after. I was horrified and felt so violated. I remember just wanting to cry as I tried to use life hacks to remove it. Eventually, I got it faded enough, and when he saw me next he joked about needing to do it again. It was clear that he wanted to mark me as his territory and it was very gross. I am not sure if I am being dramatic over this, and I wish I did more to stop him. In a way I feel like it is my fault? 

I only slept with him a few times, and he started making cruel, and rude comments about my body. He mocked my breasts in several ways, and refused to believe me when I told him I wore a D cup. He told me I was lying. These comments all really wore down on my self confidence to the point I had trouble looking in a mirror. I had a minor pregnancy scare once (even though we were using protection—he just clearly wasn't educated on condoms) and after it cleared up, he said ""Well you know one benefit to you accidentally getting pregnant would be that your boobs would get bigger."" I was mortified, I was so angry and hurt. He made sex unpleasant in many ways and never seemed to listen to me or my needs. I won't go into that though. 

Whenever he'd try to initiate sex again, he'd refuse to wear a condom. They didn't fit him right, he didn't like how they felt, and he was too cheap to buy himself some that fit. I offered to, but he never would measure for me. So I gave up and would turn him down whenever he wanted sex. While cuddling or initiating he'd try and make it weird like ""it'd be so easy to just slide it in..."" like it was gonna turn me on? Important piece of context, he also wouldn't get STD tested when we started dating because of a fear of needles. He ended up starting to try and pressure/guilt me into having sex. For example, he started saying ""You know, I think sex is a very healthy part of a relationship."" out of the blue to me a few times and I'd just go ""You know very well why we're not sleeping together.""

Toward the end, I didn't understand why, but I began flinching when he tried to touch me and would grow panicked whenever he'd come near me. He noticed and complained that it was making him look bad. This was just a few weeks before my final straw. 

My final straw was a sequence of events:   
  
1. Our mutual friend was being awarded for an accomplishment and we both went to the ceremony as her guests. She told us strictly that we needed to wear business attire and he refused to believe her. He showed up in crocs, a pair of jeans, and a wrinkled t-shirt. I was already a little on edge because of this, but the entire ceremony, he would be whispering to me how stupid he found ceremonies and called it a waste of time. When it was over, we left and he could tell I was angry. I explained and he gave me a lackluster apology. Someone at the event said we were a good match because I ""mellowed him out"" and he brought this up and said it offended him because he didn't want to be ""mellowed out by anyone."" This also ended up hurting my feelings too. 

2. He was on the phone with me and started talking about how people with adhd have the world built for them. He proceeded to say they all needed to just man up and deal with it like he had and I started telling him that he needed to stop putting people in boxes. After a while of me explaining adhd and my  big sister's experiences with adhd, he told me on the call ""I'm gonna be honest, I am not even listening to you."" He apologized for being a jackass later, but started up the behavior again almost immediately. 

3. This one took place when I told him we needed to talk. We planned a date and time to meet and talk over our issues. I was almost in tears as I told him all the things that he did that hurt me. The entire time we talked he stayed on his laptop, working on homework, barely even looking up at me. He didn't even apologize. He started saying he felt judged by me and that he had to ""walk on eggshells around me"", and that I was not putting effort into the relationship like he was. For some reason, in this conversation he started saying that he found all religious people to be idiotic and that angered me even more because he's once again being overly judgmental to a huge group of people and that is against my personal morals. It only sealed the deal. I broke up with him and the final text he sent me said ""Don't you think this is silly?"" and it still hurts me. 

I didn't see a lot of these red flags until after I broke up with him and I was talking to friends who were mortified to hear of (and point out) the assault, the attempted coercion, and the emotional abuse. Now that I understand what happened in full I blame myself for enduring this for several months. Not only this, but I constantly tell myself I am being dramatic and that maybe he wasn't so bad? I am not sure if that makes sense. I am too scared to tell our mutual friends, and I am too scared to report him even though he's about to be put into leadership positions and I am terrified of him having power over other students (and myself) when I am convinced that he is a manipulator if not a full blown sociopath. I haven't even told my family about what really happened, and this whole situation has been incredibly traumatic and haunts me daily. I feel like it's my job to stop him before he hurts someone else, but I also feel like what he did was not enough for me to report him to our uni. Maybe I am just downplaying things, idk. Either way, I am scared of the future. I am worried if I report him, he'll try and get revenge. If I don't, I'm worried that I will be forced to see him and coexist with him in this student group without being able to tell people what happened. The thought makes me want to throw up, and I am so angry for letting this situation happen in the first place. If I had only prioritized myself earlier and not put up with mistreatment, maybe it would not have gotten so bad.

18262,1dlw59i,post,BF on every gay dating app known to man ,"I (M) have been with my boyfriend for almost a year now and this year has been particularly difficult for him he lost his mom in January, has a terrible schedule and workload at work, his family uses him as a bank,…etc. I love him and he says he loves me. He does incredibly sweet things for me and I have tried to do the same for him but I was unemployed for awhile as I moved across the country the beginning of last year and have been looking for and applying to multiple jobs. We did meet on Grindr so it’s no surprise to me that he has that account. About 5 and a half months into this relationship we were out at a bar and I got foolishly stupid drunk and made out and groped some guy, don’t know why I did it, my boyfriend was at that time the only man I wanted but it happened. I apologized he said it was ok and we sat and had a long talk. He told me that for the entire time we were dating he was going on dating/hook apps and still talking to people. he said he hasn’t physically cheated and never would, I was shocked and felt incredibly betrayed told him about soft/emotional cheating and how that it’s only a matter of time before he does physically cheat. In the same conversation he tells me he’s got a prescription for Cialis (our sex life does not need it) and that he was adding DoxyPep with his Prep (for those who don’t know prep is a pill for HIV prevention , and doxypep is other STI prevention, I was floored as I haven’t been with anyone else the entire relationship I asked if he had been with anyone else and he said no. I asked if he was looking for an open relationship cause I wasn’t and am still not. He said no and that I was the best thing in his life we exchanged the L word the first time and I thought that would be the end of the apps. So a week later with the talk of new medications and apps floating in my head I got the opportunity to check his phone, now I’m not proud of this he was asleep and left his phone unlocked so I checked, I looked through any already opened apps I found Grindr, Adam4Adam and Sniffies. I also found a few texts that were sexually explicit but nothing that said you know thanks for the sex. Crushed I went out to dinner with my friend to see what I should do, context we had just celebrated my birthday and also just came back from Hawaii with his father and sister as a memorial trip for his dead mother! So my friend justified my going through his phone because “I have my own trauma” and said that my boyfriend is a very insecure person (being older than me) and controlling and that maybe he was going to these apps to get validation. He said I needed to have an honest and serious conversation with him, I agreed cried for a bit and that was that. That weekend got super crossfaded drunkenly told my boyfriend everything I knew about the apps and sexual texts and how I felt betrayed. He and rightfully so said he felt betrayed cause he trusted me not to go through his phone and that was personal and that he likes to go on the apps to see who’s gay around him, not to give too much away but we live in San Francisco everyone is gay around him! I told him that and he was like yea but seeing there face on apps tells me that and I said great that works for Grindr cause you can’t have explicit pictures as your profile picture but Sniffies and Adam4Adam most of the pictures are ass or dick so you recognizing some of the asses or dicks? He got offended, we fought made up and again I thought that would be the end of the apps. During same fight I brought up the doxypep and he used a fire extinguisher as a metaphor “it’s just to have it doesn’t mean I’ll use it blah. Well my crazy went into full blown mode after that and I’ve checked his phones when they are unlocked and he’s asleep, his Apple watch while he was sleeping and it was on him, tried to find his bottle of Cialis and Doxypep cause I wanted to count the amount of pills, like seriously…crazy, still finding messages but nothing saying he physically cheated just pictures and texts, he stills goes on apps and now I have anonymous profiles on the three I knew of to track when he goes on. He hides the pill bottles don’t know where but basically tore his place apart looking for them found a little travel pill thing in his work bag which had you guessed it a Cialis pill and his prep didn’t find the doxypep, now my mind goes into overdrive and puts together the fact that he goes on the apps at work and that he takes Cialis and Prep with him to work that he’s most likely cheating on me at his lunch breaks. Tell my friend this new information he tells me I have to talk to boyfriend again but this time with a clear head no alcohol so we can figure this all out. We have another talk I again ask if he’s looking for an open relationship however this time I say if that’s the case great I’ll pull back be a once a month booty call or whatever but I’m in super deep and if this is only a weekend thing for you let me know again he tells me he doesn’t want to lose me he loves me I’m the best thing in his life…etc. so again I thought that would be the last of the apps. Well last night he fell asleep on the couch his phones were unlocked and this time I didn’t just look at opened apps I found his folder marked socials and opened it he is on every gay dating app ever I mean I was blown away by how many there were in the folder and I clicked on 75 percent of them was able to go into his messages and it’s still the same thing, I swear this man is driving me crazy so I sit up on his couch cause I couldn’t share a bed with him this morning crying and needing to just tell anyone about this. 

Btw it has been several months of this, thanks for reading if you did.","BF on every gay dating app known to man  I (M) have been with my boyfriend for almost a year now and this year has been particularly difficult for him he lost his mom in January, has a terrible schedule and workload at work, his family uses him as a bank,…etc. I love him and he says he loves me. He does incredibly sweet things for me and I have tried to do the same for him but I was unemployed for awhile as I moved across the country the beginning of last year and have been looking for and applying to multiple jobs. We did meet on Grindr so it’s no surprise to me that he has that account. About 5 and a half months into this relationship we were out at a bar and I got foolishly stupid drunk and made out and groped some guy, don’t know why I did it, my boyfriend was at that time the only man I wanted but it happened.

18263,1dig5f5,post,My girlfriend cheated on me with my friend and gaslit me into believing there is something wrong with me,"This is gonna be a long read so sorry in advance, i appreciate everyone who reads this whole thing,

Let me preface this by saying i know im nowhere near perfect, but this is my side of the story.

I dont even know where to start, i guess with a little bit of backstory:

Me and my (now ex) girlfriend (im gonna call her K) were in a really serious relationship. Everything seemed to be going great and everyone said we both looked really happy together (and we were). We loved each other, never had fights (with a few small exceptions that we resolved quickly) and we had no reason to even think about breaking up.

Now, i guess in retrospect the beginning of the end started after my birthday last year. I met a new friend and we became really close really quickly (Gonna call him D). After some time, i noticed that when we (me and gf) were hanging out with our friends, he would start talking to her and later they would move to the side to talk privately for like an hour. At first i didnt really bat an eye as K and D had some common topics and i wrote it off as them not wanting to be interrupted by our random conversations (between others in the friend group). Later it started annoying me but i still didnt think much of it. I brought it up a few times to K and she basically told me they talk about their childhood trauma or whatever as they had really similar childhoods with messed up families and i nor anyone else in the group could really relate which i understood. i just told her to please chill a bit with it as it was starting to get on my nerves. The issue was temporarily resolved until one day she broke up with me out of the blue. She gave me a bullshit explanation which included the following: The day before, i somehow ended up hanging out with this guy who used to be my friend but fucked me over.... I dont know how that concerns her but i wasnt really thinking straight cause the breakup was so random i didnt even know what was going on so i didnt question it. Another reason she gave me was that even tho we resolved the issue with D and she talked to him less or at least didnt make me feel neglected when we all hung out together, she still felt like i had a problem with it and she just couldnt live like that???? I know, that sounds stupid, i guess we talked some more and shit and then i went home. I still hadnt processed everything that just happened but the next day, i went out with her best friend (gonna call her M).

M told me the actual reason K broke up with me is cause of my lack of communication and not telling her about my demons and struggles or whatever so she felt like she couldnt talk to me. There was some more stuff but its not that relevant. the next day me and K went out and talked for hours and cleared things up. Basically she was telling me what M told me and also that when she has a problem, my way of comforting her (trying to lighten up her mood or at least make her laugh a bit and stuff) was doing no good and it had to change. She also told me that if she didnt break up with me, i would never change which i agreed with and told her that there was a high possibility of her being right. 

So at this point, were still talking over messages and saying we love each other and showing affection and all that and she tells me that she wrote me a letter and she wants to give it to me irl. we end up seeing each other the next day and she shows me pics of the letter on her phone cause she didnt expect to see me so she didnt bring it. it was hand written and you could see the tear drops on the paper. id transcribe it here but im worried that if i read it again, im gonna have a mental breakdown. In short, she told me how much she loved me and missed me, and how she is never gonna forget me or feel the same with anyone else, and that i am special and that she is selfish for saying all of that as she was the one that broke up with me. Also said she would give her life for me and she will never forgive herself for doing this to me as im a great person and she knows i never meant any harm but it was just the right thing to do as she was hurting. It really felt genuine and meant a lot to me. The day after, we went out to smoke some weed and she gave me the rewritten version of the letter with some minor stuff changed but it was basically the same. We ended up agreeing to get back together that night after she told me she observed a big change in my behavior or whatever.

I didnt mention this before but her and D were kinda phisically close and touchy but i guess i was blinded by my love and didnt see it as a big concern. also in her friend group (which kinda merged with my friend group and we became one big FG during our relationship) it was a normal thing and it was not just between her and D so i didnt really find it odd.

Damn this is getting long, here comes the fun part (for you, not for me really).

about two weeks later, everything is back to normal with one exception, her relationship with D was getting really really close if thats the right word (english is not my native language so appologies for any mistakes) and it started rubbing me the wrong way but iirc i didnt really bring it up or if i did i didnt push really hard. at the 2 week mark of us getting back together, im at my friends birthday and she messages me shes really drunk and blah blah blah (normal thing for us to dm about every mundane random thing during the day), a few hours later she tells me she is home with D and that her mom is there and that theyre gonna go to the gas station over the street to get a bottle of wine or whatever. im not gonna explain everything but that was a normal thing in our friend group to just randomly drink and often it was wine but still.... later, she tells me they wanna go to sleep but theyre probably not gonna and theyre gonna stay up all night cause theyre talking or whatever. im like ""D is sleeping over?"". and she said yes. I asked if hes gonna sleep in her bed (she had a big 2 person bed and her mother had her own room) expecting her to say ofc not and she says sarcastiacally something like ""no hes not"" (there is a word in my language that is used in these sarcastic sentences that has no translation in english but you get the point). I get really pissed off and tell her were gonna talk the next day cause i was drunk and sleepy after the birthday.

The next day, i was supposed to come sleep over at her place which we arranged a week earlier. I get there and her mother is there so we go to her room a few minutes later. We talk and talk and she attempts to gaslight me into believeing what happened the night before is just a normal thing friends do with the justification being that everyone in the friend group does it and her mom didnt let him sleep on the couch....

At first she cuddled me and cried and appologized and told me she was gonna chill out with D and that she was crossing boundaries but later doubled down and told me shes not gonna change her relationship with any of her friends cause of me and that its selfish and i can leave her if i dont like it and she would understand. She also gave me shit for not instantly telling her what the problem is but first going to my best friends X and Z to see if i was overreacting. She said i shouldnt be asking them shit and i should think for myself. Later i learned thats a common thing manipulators do. they isolate you from your loved ones so youre easier to manipulate. We kinda agreed that she would not push it that far again (sleeping in the same bed with him, even if her mother is there) and we would put this behind for the greater good of our relationship. like an hour later, my other friend X messages me and tells me that he warned D that i was pissed and that i might verbally or phisically attack him (X is a great friend and i know he meant no harm and were still friends, he just has poor judgement in situations like this which i cant blame him for god bless him). D then DMd K and told her us 3 need to talk and he was coming soon. we went out to the gas station across the street and met him there, talked for some time and they basically both denied it being anything but platonic friendship and all that. at that point i was just exahusted and wanted to end the conversation and fight and put all of that behind so we kinda came to an understanding at the end.

When it was time for D to go home and for us to return, i wanted to buy some juice to mix with the vodka i had brought to Ks place but forgot my wallet inside her home so D so generously offered to buy me the juice. not even the 0.5l bottle i needed but the big expensive 2l bottle i didnt even know what to do with. (later i would realize how much he was actually dickriding to get me to like him again)

so the next day, Ks mother is off to work in the morning and i promised K were gonna have sex in the morning cause we havent in a long time and i know how sad she is when we miss a chance to fuck especially when she wanted it first like in this instance. so in the morning, we wake up and i ask her if she wants to do it now cause her mother is coming back in a few hours. shes like ""let me sleep for like 15 more minutes"" so i cuddle her for an hour and a half more until we wake up again. we do it, clean up and she is moody. instead of i guess comforting her the way she wanted, i tried to make her laugh and lighten up her mood and shit. i went home later and she broke up with me over text. she told me she thought i changed but i really didnt and referenced what happened that morning as proof. 

I, being so blinded by my love for K didnt even realize all the bullshit she was talking and allowed her to gaslight me into thinking there is something wrong with me. I really thought i was the problem and didnt even think about D as i had no proof anything happened between them. I begged her to at least go out to talk with me and to not end it all like this and she agreed but she was mad. she was mad at me cause in our breakup conversation i guess i compared myself to her exes by saying i hope you wont talk shit about me like you do about your other exes. i guess she was offended that i would ever put myself on the same level as them or whatever. Anyways, we end up going out the next day.

Now, before i say the next part, i want to remind you about the letter she wrote me just two weeks prior and about everything she said to me back then.

So, i meet her and shes completely cold. I am trying to talk to her and shes constantly looking at her phone, checking the time, telling me she has to go in X minutes and generally making me feel like this means nothing to her. She did actually cry a bit but she tried to hide it to maintain her cold image or whatever. but yeah, for the most part she was cold asf which was really shocking to me and i couldnt help but think of how she was acting just 2 weeks prior.

Now for my biggest L of this story, i end up appologizing to D for treating him how i did and all everything that happened.

I got home and just went into the bathroom, locked the door, sat on the floor and then it all actually hit me. i ended up writing dms to K for almost 2 hours telling her everything and how i felt cause i wasnt really comfortable saying it all when we met up cause i was put off by her coldness. 

Long story short, within the following months i was slowly pushed out of the friend group while everyone individually was still acting like my friends. 

The worst part now:

In an effort to keep me in the friend group, one day my best friend X calls me to hang out with all of them. Were hanging out and everything is normal when out the corner of my eye, for a second, i see what i think was K and D making out but i wasnt sure so i didnt react. i call X over and trying to stay lowkey ask him if i just saw what i think i saw and he tells me yup, they announced their relationship a few days earlier. at this point i just go behind some building and call up my friend who was not in the city at the time just to tell him this. He has known K and D for like the longest time and told me he was sure they would never get into a relationship when i was doubting myself after the breakup.

He was shocked and i still remember his words on when i told him that. 

I ended up talking to him for like an hour untill my battery died. I went back, just took my things and said i was in a hurry and couldnt stay any longer. I was ready to fucking die. Everything was a lie. So much time wasted, my friedships, my relationship, all of it, lies. i thought i was gonna faint or puke. the weight of it all was just unbearable. the worst fucking feeling ive ever expirienced. i finally knew i was right all along. the good thing is that i stopped loving her at that moment and that person was dead to me. the new K was someone i didnt know and didnt love. there was no more K i spent all this time with, i loved so much and experienced everything with. she was dead. the bad part is that i didnt know how to cope with it and the truth is, 8 months later, i still think about it every day and wonder, how can one be so cruel. i know what we had was real love and there is no doubt in my mind about that. I get that people cheat, i get that she mightve gotten bored or stopped loving me and i dont blame her for that, but how can you be so selfish. was it really easier to gaslight me into thinking im a bad person and that there is something wrong with me than just admitting you have feelings for someone else.

How can you be so cruel, its like torture. It still affects me to this day and i think about what happened every day. I moved on but it hurt so bad im still feeling it. How can you knowingly hurt someone so bad? someone you once loved.

How do you live with yourself knowing what you did and what kind of person you are. I know she can experience empathy and shes not a psychopath, so how do you just do something like that. dont you have feelings?

She uses reddit so she might find this. I hope she doesnt but in case she does, its too specific for her to not realize its about her.

I guess if she does find it, ive got nothing to say to her. I dont hate her and i dont love her, im not sure if i forgave her or if im ever going to, but im damn sure never gonna forget.","My girlfriend cheated on me with my friend and gaslit me into believing there is something wrong with me This is gonna be a long read so sorry in advance, i appreciate everyone who reads this whole thing,

I begged her to at least go out to talk with me and to not end it all like this and she agreed but she was mad. she was mad at me cause in our breakup conversation i guess i compared myself to her exes by saying i hope you wont talk shit about me like you do about your other exes. i guess she was offended that i would ever put myself on the same level as them or whatever. Anyways, we end up going out the next day.

Now, before i say the next part, i want to remind you about the letter she wrote me just two weeks prior and about everything she said to me back then.

So, i meet her and shes completely cold. I am trying to talk to her and shes constantly looking at her phone, checking the time, telling me she has to go in X minutes and generally making me feel like this means nothing to her. She did actually cry a bit but she tried to hide it to maintain her cold image or whatever. but yeah, for the most part she was cold asf which was really shocking to me and i couldnt help but think of how she was acting just 2 weeks prior.

Now for my biggest L of this story, i end up appologizing to D for treating him how i did and all everything that happened.

I got home and just went into the bathroom, locked the door, sat on the floor and then it all actually hit me. i ended up writing dms to K for almost 2 hours telling her everything and how i felt cause i wasnt really comfortable saying it all when we met up cause i was put off by her coldness. 

Long story short, within the following months i was slowly pushed out of the friend group while everyone individually was still acting like my friends. 

The worst part now:

In an effort to keep me in the friend group, one day my best friend X calls me to hang out with all of them. Were hanging out and everything is normal when out the corner of my eye, for a second, i see what i think was K and D making out but i wasnt sure so i didnt react. i call X over and trying to stay lowkey ask him if i just saw what i think i saw and he tells me yup, they announced their relationship a few days earlier. at this point i just go behind some building and call up my friend who was not in the city at the time just to tell him this. He has known K and D for like the longest time and told me he was sure they would never get into a relationship when i was doubting myself after the breakup.

He was shocked and i still remember his words on when i told him that. 

I ended up talking to him for like an hour untill my battery died. I went back, just took my things and said i was in a hurry and couldnt stay any longer. I was ready to fucking die. Everything was a lie. So much time wasted, my friedships, my relationship, all of it, lies. i thought i was gonna faint or puke. the weight of it all was just unbearable. the worst fucking feeling ive ever expirienced. i finally knew i was right all along. the good thing is that i stopped loving her at that moment and that person was dead to me. the new K was someone i didnt know and didnt love. there was no more K i spent all this time with, i loved so much and experienced everything with. she was dead. the bad part is that i didnt know how to cope with it and the truth is, 8 months later, i still think about it every day and wonder, how can one be so cruel. i know what we had was real love and there is no doubt in my mind about that. I get that people cheat, i get that she mightve gotten bored or stopped loving me and i dont blame her for that, but how can you be so selfish. was it really easier to gaslight me into thinking im a bad person and that there is something wrong with me than just admitting you have feelings for someone else.

How can you be so cruel, its like torture. It still affects me to this day and i think about what happened every day. I moved on but it hurt so bad im still feeling it. How can you knowingly hurt someone so bad? someone you once loved.

How do you live with yourself knowing what you did and what kind of person you are. I know she can experience empathy and shes not a psychopath, so how do you just do something like that. dont you have feelings?

She uses reddit so she might find this. I hope she doesnt but in case she does, its too specific for her to not realize its about her.

I guess if she does find it, ive got nothing to say to her. I dont hate her and i dont love her, im not sure if i forgave her or if im ever going to, but im damn sure never gonna forget.",1,0,2024-06-18 2:41,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1dig5f5/my_girlfriend_cheated_on_me_with_my_friend_and/,Neutral
18264,1die0fx,post,I got my best friend’s husband arrested and I think I lost her,"This is going to be long and quite rambling so sorry in advance. Backstory: I (31f) have known my best friend, Em, (31f) since school and she has been all I could ever ask for from a friend. She was there for me through really hard times and I view her like the sister I never had. Her and her family have always accepted me and I could never thank them enough. We’ve rarely had arguments and the few times I remember have been because of guys. This is not in the way many people would think. We do not like the same guys, not even the same type of guys. More like neither one of us have really liked each others past partners for different reasons. So that’s something we usually leave to each other. We avoided, for the most part, talking about partners. Well Em started bringing this guy around at the place we worked at, back in 2014 or around then. She met him at work and I thought she just wanted to add him to the work friend group. Let’s call him B. B was a few years older than us and when I met him he creeped me out, a lot. I just got weird vibes from him and it was an “I don’t wanna be around this guy” vibe. But I kept it to myself and just stayed distant.

Another work friend of Em’s, after a while of them hanging out, asked me about B. I was kinda honest saying I don’t really care for B and he kinda creeps me out. She told me he was a sex offender. Now I know she was gossiping and just wanting to talk shit but it was true. I looked it up and was disgusted. At this point I was against being around B. I may have let Em know this and she withdrew a bit. Months later I found out she knew, before I told her, and was dating him. Now Em is my sister in my mind so while I was not loving it it is her life she can date who she wants. 

Em moved in with him after them dating for like a year. I would go over there and he would stay away from me in his room when I was there. Eventually Em asked me to be nice and try to hang out with him for her,I did for her. He knew I did not like him but I was trying to support her. We did text and grow more friendly but I still was creeped out by him. It was just always in the back of my mind. I hated this and pushed more to try to be nice cause I’m not the nicest person. I tried to treat him like the other friends in the group. A few times he texted me mildly sexual jokes, which could be viewed as flirtatious or inappropriate. I told him each time that he made me uncomfortable and to stop texting me. I did not tell Em. He apologized, stopped dead in his tracks and played it off like he was joking. I didn’t want to be the one to get in between the two as she already knew I didn’t like him. I didn’t want her to think I was trying to break them up or cause a fight or whatever. I wish I did I now looking back. 

Now for the main part: In November of 2021 I had to move my furniture in my room as the apartments were replacing the windows and wanted nothing in front of them. I was moving my desk and found a camera under it pointing to where I sit in my computer chair. Dread immediately filled me. I’ve always had bad anxiety and been very paranoid so now I’m freaking out thinking someone in maintenance put cameras in our apartment. I then thought “Em watched my cat for a week just a few months ago she stayed in my room. Maybe this is a weird prank and the camera is fake”. This was to make myself not breakdown. I called her and got no answer. Now it was pretty late so figured she was in bed. I called her now husband B. He answered and I asked if I could talk to her. He said she was asleep, so I told him about the camera and was going to ask if she was playing a weird prank. His response was “You should just destroy it.” Immediately I knew. I knew it was him and said “No I think I’ll just call the cops” and hung up. I freaked out telling my roommate and he was trying to calm me down when B called back. He was crying and admitted to it begging me to not call the cops and he saw nothing from it. He woke Em up and told her. A lot happened but that night my roommate drove me to their apartment and I demanded my key Em had to pet sit. I got two from them. He took my key from her and made a copy of his own. For months he was going into our apartment to go in my room and install cameras. I found I think 4 of them. I did call the cops after warning her so she could leave him if she needed to to be safe. I’ve seen too many true crime shows and people can do crazy things in times they think they’re getting arrested. I was even offering our spare bed if she wanted to leave and needed a place to stay. She declined at first begging me not to call the cops and saying she’ll restrict his internet access and what tech he has access to, like grounding a child. I was upset and she eventually understood I would call the cops. She was distraught, she was disgusted by what he did but thought she could not live on her own or afford paying court costs if she had to cause money was tight. 

We were both going through it but supporting each other. He did get arrested and me and Em took some time apart. I haven’t seen her since I got my keys. We texted again after a few months. Talked on the phone often and tried to make plans to meet up but it just has not happened. Now I haven’t talked to her since February of this year. I’ve texted and called but she is not responding to me. I know I’m not blocked and she hasn’t changed her number, we’re on the same phone plan. I know she’s not dead cause our other friend lives with her. He refuses to talk to me about anything to do with her now. So now I think I’ve lost my sister, my best friend in the whole world because of a shitty guy. I never thought we’d end over something like this. Do I want this friendship? Can we move past this? What can I do? I’m so lost and hurt, I just needed to let this all out and get this off my chest finally. 

Edit: Thank you everyone for reading and just listening to my rant about this. I wrote this last night during my last breakdown. I was slightly tipsy so I did rush this and wanted to keep this short but give context to know he always disturbed me. For context the last year I thought we, Em and I, were getting back to how we were before this happened. We texted and sent each other voice memos all the time sharing funny life updates. To my knowledge after he got arrested she left him. He no longer lived with her even after the light slap on the wrist. I don’t know what happened to him and honestly I don’t give two shits about this terrible person. But I love Em so I wanted to keep the only lasting friendship I’ve ever had. I don’t know if they divorced but from what I picked up they were at least no longer together but past that I don’t know much about what she did. Understandably she avoided being him up with me, I think it was to not upset me. I just know nothing now and my worst fear is that she made up with him. I know everything has changed but I didn’t want to lose her for something that he decided to do.","I got my best friend’s husband arrested and I think I lost her This is going to be long and quite rambling so sorry in advance.

I (25F) just feel like I’m in some miserable shell watching a life I want no part of. I know I’m only the millionth post out of a million more to come about being sad but I think I’m finally becoming content with leaving and I just really actually hope I am going to follow through with it.

One time I heard a girl at school in passing in the counselors saying she feels like a glitch, like she wasn’t meant to happen and  that’s all I ever feel. It’s not even from just my own “mental illness” or issues, life has only made me feel unwelcomed and it’s getting worse day by day. Truthfully, I have no friends despite always being a well rounded person. I get along with most people and based off reactions and invites people seem to enjoy my company but nobody cares when I need them and I don’t even like any of them, really. They don’t even seem to like me fully. People are often mean to me and I just play it off. I’ve had an interview lately suggested by some friends who even worked there and I was berrated by the interviewer and told I lacked anything and wasted their time for showing up. My friends said I should’ve done better. A coworker recently insisted on helping me with my car and he drove it into a curb and the damage was too bad I had to sell my car and I’m now carless. He said it was my fault and tried to say he would’ve fixed it but he avoided me till I sold my car and refused to admit he did anything wrong since he “helped” me it canceled out hurting my car. My finances brother and sister in law suggested a friend/realtor who lied to us about homes and tricked us first time buyers into getting into a very bad home. We’re in debt and the house is falling apart. His brother and SIL said it was our fault for listening to their suggestion and that we didn’t have to go with their friend realtor. I cut out my mom because she was so bad to me and my sisters and everyone but it was my fault for a list of reasons that are unhinged (she’s a mentally ill alcoholic). I had to fight with our only friends (my finances friends) because some of them tried to book a party the same night as our engagement party. The rest of the group holds resentment towards me because I defended us and everyone knew we were in the right. My sister was beating her kids with a 2x4 so I had to call the police so my family doesn’t talk to me. My father is a sex offender, not in my life. Step dad was abusive and died a couple years ago. I was harassed at work and told there’s nothing to do as in the man was spoken to and that’s all they can do. Same with coworkers talking about me on teams, supervisor just told everyone to be more smart on when and how they message. I’ve tried dieting and changing meds and working out and can’t lose weight. I also only find comfort in food so I will only be fat forever. I’m 225 lbs of pure misery. 

 All of this has happened while being with my fiancé who’s just too much of an angel but too nice. I’m not sure if I love him. I’ve been on autopilot and can’t tell when it’s off. He’s forgiven and moved past all that has screwed us and me because he says it’s the best you can do. I can’t move on and just know I’m clearly too unlucky to be around. It won’t stop. I’m dragging him down and don’t want to have to keep being the world’s punching bag. Hell, I was even sadly gifted with sensory issues where I can’t stand the feeling of almost all materials. I’m never comfortable. I also have health anxiety with new health issues doctors keep bouncing me around about and won’t solve. Today I had a $100 doctor visit for gallstones and he said I’m fine since I’m not in pain too often enough and sent me home. I have a $30,000 ER bill from when I panicked and went because I was throwing up bile/had some bug (I ended up fine). I never win. It’s not even clearly just my outlook on life. It’s just my life. I don’t want it. I’m uncomfortable and scared and stressed at all times. I don’t even see a future for myself. I have to beg for love and for people to see my pain and when they do it’s always the most generic responses and care and they move on. I get that’s what you do in life but I can’t. I’m a glitch that just annoys people and is annoyed by everything myself. I wasn’t supposed to be here. 

TL;DR I was never meant to be born. I exist to only hate existence. I’m scared of death and want to die. I clearly am venting since I wish life was better but the only resolution I have is to end it.  ","I don’t like any aspect or corner of my life TW:

18266,1dei1c1,post,"My marriage is completely sexless, and it wasn't a problem until now.","Hey Reddit, I (31m) and my wife (34f) have been married for almost 10 years, she had just graduated college the spring prior and I was closing in on a journalism degree as well, we're pretty well of on the money side. We decided pretty early that we wanted kids down the line, but it was better to start slow, but over the last year and change, I'm a little disheartened by something.

We had more sex in our first 3 years of marriage than the last 6+ years combined- I thought back, and in the past 6 years, I can recall 8 occasions where we've engaged in any form of sex. When I was younger, I would've never thought sex would *ever* become a deal breaker for me, but I'm nearing that point now and I'm ashamed to say, I even turned to masturbation over the last year.

Not chronically, I did it no more than a couple times a month, but I've noticed that I have felt better this past year, than any of the prior five years. By far. I did see a therapist and am on the autism spectrum, and he informed me that the human body often craves to have some form of sexual stimuli. And he told me while every person's drive for it is different, he essentially told me to listen to my own body, but he recommended telling her the truth as well.

I am a bleeding heart and I hate keeping anything secret, so I worked up the courage for a few days and back in March, I confided in my wife what I was doing, and I was crying as I did this. I think it was the only reason she didn't scream at me, but I could tell she was definitely not happy about what she was hearing and I understood that completely.

We discussed it for a little while, and we decided that I would stop masturbating, and she said that she would try to initiate more, but I'm realizing just how empty that conclusion was. I've held up my end, I have not masturbated and she has full access to my search history, but we have not had sex once in the months since, and it ate away at me between April and May.

In Early May, I got really suspicious and began pressing as to who else could be involved, to which she got really offended, but I was just stumped at this point. We got in an argument and I asked her why she's so disinterested in my, why I've become such a roommate to her, in my mind there had to be somebody else, but I was wrong. She allowed me to search through her phone, even thought that's not really what I cared about.

I found nobody even remotely suspicious, but that made me feel even worse, which frustrated her greatly. She genuinely dislikes me so much, that she would rather not even cheat, and stay with me just to... what, isolate me? I have a supportive friend group and we do stuff all the time, we all play for the local hockey team as well and that's been an amazing escape for me these past few months.

But I've been asking her the last few weeks constantly about marriage counseling, or about just doing things together, I've asked her if she still wants a kid. She says yes to kids, no to marriage counseling, and she always says we can do something when we both have time. Last week, I asked her why she wouldn't do marriage counseling, and why she won't even really comfort me (it's not even about sex at this point, she barely acknowledges me emotionally), and why she even rejects my advances.

She got really short and told me to grow up, and that I don't need a hug for every little problem I run into, which hurt me badly, and she immediately backpedaled on that statement after I started to cry. I can tell she regretted saying it, but despite her attempts to say otherwise, I know she meant it, and I've made it clear that I know. Over the past week, I've come to accept that she more than likely hates me and... that breaks my heart.

I initially made this account back when I started asking about couples' counseling, and I had really hoped I'd be posting about how we've worked on our marriage- today, I just booked a hotel room for the next few days, and I'm just going to see how I do without her for a few days. I'm not going to tell her where I am, or that I'm even leaving at all, but my ringer for her is on at full volume the whole time. I took time off of work for this as well, my colleagues were really understanding, but were also very visibly concerned for me, but I'm honestly fine.

I don't know why I don't have the guts to just call a divorce lawyer now and get it over with, but I want to make fully sure I'm making the right decision here. I just want to know if she'd even notice I'm gone, I want to know if the comforting, loving woman I married is still there for me. I may update this in the coming few days, if things improve, but if not, I'll leave it at this.

I just needed to air this out and scream into a pillow for a few hours.","My marriage is completely sexless, and it wasn't a problem until now. Hey Reddit, I (31m) and my wife (34f) have been married for almost 10 years, she had just graduated college the spring prior and I was closing in on a journalism degree as well, we're pretty well of on the money side. We decided pretty early that we wanted kids down the line, but it was better to start slow, but over the last year and change, I'm a little disheartened by something.

We had more sex in our first 3 years of marriage than the last 6+ years combined- I thought back, and in the past 6 years, I can recall 8 occasions where we've engaged in any form of sex. When I was younger, I would've never thought sex would *ever* become a deal breaker for me, but I'm nearing that point now and I'm ashamed to say, I even turned to masturbation over the last year.

Not chronically, I did it no more than a couple times a month, but I've noticed that I have felt better this past year, than any of the prior five years. By far. I did see a therapist and am on the autism spectrum, and he informed me that the human body often craves to have some form of sexual stimuli. And he told me while every person's drive for it is different, he essentially told me to listen to my own body, but he recommended telling her the truth as well.

I am a bleeding heart and I hate keeping anything secret, so I worked up the courage for a few days and back in March, I confided in my wife what I was doing, and I was crying as I did this. I think it was the only reason she didn't scream at me, but I could tell she was definitely not happy about what she was hearing and I understood that completely.

We discussed it for a little while, and we decided that I would stop masturbating, and she said that she would try to initiate more, but I'm realizing just how empty that conclusion was. I've held up my end, I have not masturbated and she has full access to my search history, but we have not had sex once in the months since, and it ate away at me between April and May.

In Early May, I got really suspicious and began pressing as to who else could be involved, to which she got really offended, but I was just stumped at this point. We got in an argument and I asked her why she's so disinterested in my, why I've become such a roommate to her, in my mind there had to be somebody else, but I was wrong. She allowed me to search through her phone, even thought that's not really what I cared about.

I found nobody even remotely suspicious, but that made me feel even worse, which frustrated her greatly. She genuinely dislikes me so much, that she would rather not even cheat, and stay with me just to... what, isolate me? I have a supportive friend group and we do stuff all the time, we all play for the local hockey team as well and that's been an amazing escape for me these past few months.

But I've been asking her the last few weeks constantly about marriage counseling, or about just doing things together, I've asked her if she still wants a kid. She says yes to kids, no to marriage counseling, and she always says we can do something when we both have time. Last week, I asked her why she wouldn't do marriage counseling, and why she won't even really comfort me (it's not even about sex at this point, she barely acknowledges me emotionally), and why she even rejects my advances.

She got really short and told me to grow up, and that I don't need a hug for every little problem I run into, which hurt me badly, and she immediately backpedaled on that statement after I started to cry. I can tell she regretted saying it, but despite her attempts to say otherwise, I know she meant it, and I've made it clear that I know. Over the past week, I've come to accept that she more than likely hates me and... that breaks my heart.

18267,1d6umiu,post,I feel like my life has been stolen and moved into a nursing home by my husband ,"
I feel like my life has been stolen from me by my husband and I’m too weak to leave.

I’m 42F married to 51M and we’ve been together 9 years. 

He’s gained a lot of weight in our time together(you can read my previous posts regarding that) putting him anywhere between 330-360 lbs. He also is addicted to food and marijuana. I once saw him so stoned and hungry that he ate food out of the garbage. 

He gets so stoned that his balance becomes an issue, his speech is slurred, and he is basically catatonic at times. 

I’ve given up on mentioning the smell because he gets defensive and I simply don’t have the energy to fight it any longer. The entire dining and kitchen area reeks of smoke and weed. If I Lysol or febreze the area he acts offended. 

We have the most gorgeous 4 seasons room off of the dining room that I’m not able to enjoy because he’s almost always out there smoking. 

The interesting thing about it, is that he takes great care to not offend our neighbors by smoking outside, but he will offend me. And, we live in a house, with room between us. Our backyards is a woods for Christ’s sake. 

Due to his weight, he’s developed a plethora of of medical issues as well and I basically feel like I’m living in a nursing home. He needs benches all over the house to sit down: a bench at the end of the bed, a bench chair in the shower, a bench when you first enter the house, benches everywhere for him to sit. Our house isn’t big. It’s 1300 sq feet. 

He asks me to help him dig out ingrown toenails from his lack of care, he has trouble climbing stairs, he can’t even walk to the end of our street without complaining that there’s no benches when I just want to go on a nice walk.   He now wants a cane. He’s 51. 

His foot odor is repugnant and I’ve told him before that I think he needs to see a specialist. 

I paid for a brand new, very expensive mattress for us last year thinking it would be a good investment on our sleep health. He didn’t contribute. Fine. But over the holidays last year, he consumed everything he possibly could that had even a speck of marijuana in it, and completely binged on sugar, liquid cheese and meat one night. I told him to stop, that he was going to be sick. He ate a gallon freezer bag full of sugar/homemade Christmas candy. 

We went to bed that night and he was moaning and groaning, so I left to sleep in the guest room. He woke me up at 7 the next morning to tell me he had shit our new bed and it had gone all the way through to the mattress but “don’t worry” because he was cleaning it. I just turned over in silence and sobbed. 

I pay all utility bills, do all cleaning and laundry. He never helps with anything unless it’s a landscaping pet project. I’ll carry heavy things up and down stairs and he won’t offer to help. 

He ripped me from a nap when I had a migraine this year, telling me I was acting like a “fucking b”  and threatened to call my parents and tell them I needed psychiatric care because I hadn’t been out of bed all day when he “needed his wife” because his mom was hospitalized. 

He’s had anger issues but is in therapy. I feel it’s too little too late. 

Yesterday he went out all day and came home with $600 worth of trees. Trees. 

I asked him about the cost and he just brushed me off. He then said his mother had given “us” money. 

I told him I didn’t view it as “our” money seeing as he didn’t consult me on how to spend it. He asked how we should be spending it and I told him we need to look into some home repairs such as a new ac and furnace unit. He semi scoffed and said well we’d need to finance that! 

….? 

We haven’t had sex in 2 years and I don’t care. He’s slid his hand down my pants to grab my bare butt and has grabbed my breasts and it makes me want to sob. 

I feel I’m being unfair. But I feel like my life has been stolen, and I’m trapped in a nursing home with coughing, complaining smoking. 

I can’t even use the bathroom without him following me and watching me pee. 

I’ve sat in corners of my house in tears just having thoughts about how I don’t want to live this way. Yes, I’m in the care of a psychiatrist. 

I want to leave. I’m too weak to do it. I feel like it’s my fault, I’ve failed him or us in some way. I just can’t stand this anymore. I cannot stand being around him. I sleep to escape him when there’s no other way. 

I’m scared of him. I’m actually horrified of him. 

UPDATE: I’m really overwhelmed with all of the support. I can’t express my gratitude and how good it makes me feel. 

Yes, I work full time and I make the most money. I mostly work from home. 

No, we don’t have joint checking or savings. 

My mother is aware of the situation and has tried to convince me to make him leave. 

My parents live 2+ hours away from me. 

I have 2 close friends who know; one tells me to kick him out, the other has said if I fear for my safety I can stay with them. 

I forgot to mention last week he was so stoned he left the gas burner on the stove. The entire first floor reeked of gas. I had to grab our two cats, call the gas company and run out the front door with no help. He could’ve killed us. 

UPDATE 2- For those messaging asking why I “just don’t leave” there’s a few reasons I haven’t yet. 

I’m rock bottom depressed. I’ve even had suicidal ideations lately. My psychiatrist is aware and we’ve had conversations about it.

It’s not that easy when you’ve slowly been mashed down like this and left to question your own reality and your life. 

Finances: I have a hell of a lot of equity wrapped up in this house, and it’s not like there’s an abundance of houses on the market, nor houses that I could probably even afford right now. This matters. 

Update 3- I just didn’t have any idea this post would generate this kind of response. 

I’m overwhelmed. 

I didn’t have any idea that I was really living this kind of level of a disgusting life. 

I didn’t. 

I’m in tears and reflecting. 

I’m likely going to take a few weeks off of work to stay with my parents, take a trip by myself, and do some serious thinking. I really am thankful for the kindness. I just didn’t realize. This response was a wake up call. ","I feel like my life has been stolen and moved into a nursing home by my husband

18268,1d4mzjq,post,"New ""friend"" added to group chat ","Okay, so maybe what I am about to write is dumb and not a big issue but it's definitely bothering me and I'm not sure what to do about it 

I moved to a new city recently and really knew only one person. So, obviously I reached out to that person, let's call him Bob, and began hanging out. Through that person, I got to experience more of the city life and he's a good friend. I wouldn't say he's a close friend but he's fun to hang out with. Through him, I ended up meeting a couple more people and I've been hanging out with them a little more regularly. However, recently, he added another person, let's call her Judy, to a group chat we have. I really liked Judy...at first. She seemed chill and a nice person. But then I got to know her a bit more and I noticed she very passive aggressively tries to one up me in a lot of different situations. For example, I was talking about how long I've known Bob for because I was asking him if he could be a reference for something and then Judy suddenly said in a very jealous tone of voice, ""aww wow you've known him for a year longer than I have."" Mind you, this lady has a partner she's been with for a couple years now and if anything, I think she is closer in her relationship with Bob than me. I told her I knew Bob longer but I didn't start hanging out with him until this year. I still don't consider him a close friend either but he's a good one.

Then later, we were walking together somewhere and she began randomly mocking a certain religion that I follow. But I have not told anyone besides mentioning it once a long time ago to Bob that I follow this religion and I also don't impose my beliefs on anyone. I try not to be judgemental and I don't think it's my business what religion anyone else follows, just like it's not anyone's business on how I choose to lead my life. But she was very openly and randomly mocking it, without any provocation from outside sources, which led me to wonder if Bob said something about me to Judy that rubbed her the wrong way.

The only thing I could think of that Bob said was maybe he told Judy what I confided in Bob about one of his other friends (let's call her Madison). Or maybe he told her about what I again confidentialy told him about that one night we went clubbing and now my partner hates his guts. 

Here's the story with Madison: I met her only once before at one of Bob's parties and she seemed pretty cool when I first met her. We talked and then eventually set a date to hang out again later. That later date came, we hung out, and then I was taking her back home. The hang out was a class so we actually didn't talk much during it but on the way home, she confided in me about some troubles she was having about her current partner, let's call him John. To make a very long story short, their relationship was very rocky, especially since he was bad at sex. But he was rich so she didn't want to leave him. They tried being an open relationship for a while so she could get her fix with other guys without ending anything and she really appreciated John for agreeing with the open relationship. During that time, she was meeting up with another guy but John didn't meet with anyone else. Also, I guess Madison read his journal and John put in there that she wasn't the one. She also found out that John had unprotected sex with his previous partners and was absolutely disgusted. She wasn't sure if she should stay with him or not. But he's so RICH. She shared all this (and more) on the first day that I actually got to hang out with her one-on-one and during that time I really tried to be understanding, non-judgemental, and not think of it as trauma dumping as another friend told me. But I was really struggling with not thinking of her as a toxic person and that I was glad I found this out very early on. However, I wondered if I was being an asshole and I regrettably confided in Bob about this situation. Bob seemed understanding during our interaction but I have a sus feeling he talked about this to others, especially Judy, behind my back. Not sure if they interpreted my intentions wrong or if I'm just being paranoid. But it sort of makes sense why Judy would then suddenly randomly try to attack my beliefs, even though she has a very twisted notion of what I believe, if she even knows at all.

Here's the story why my partner hates Bob: So a couple months ago, I went clubbing with Bob and another friend. During that time, I was fighting a lot with my partner. So naturally, I went out and got shit faced and danced to forget all the bullshit and also just to have fun of course. That night, there was another guy who came to talk with our group and was flirting with me. Me, a dumb person, continued to talk to him, not sure if I was slurring any words. But it was loud in the club so he leaned closer and was like, ""WHAT?"" so I leaned into his ear and yelled out something I don't remember. But when I did that he put his arms around my waist. I was taken aback and for a second, I gotta admit, I liked it cuz this attention was making me feel sexy. But I'm not a cheater and never plan on being one. So I pulled away and stopped talking to the guy. My friends and I danced some more and then went out to get food from the food stand outside. That's when I hurled up everything I had inside of me from the day I was born. JK but it was gross. That signified the end of my night because now I smelled like vomit and so my partner very kindly picked me up and took my drunk ass home.

The next day, I told my partner what happened and I apologized for flirting with another dude. He said it was okay and that he still loves and trusts me. 

Later that night, I was chatting with a friend over the phone and told her about my club night. She asked me what Bob and the other friend were doing when they saw this random stranger flirting with me when my friends knew that I have a partner. I told her they didn't do anything. I mean I didn't really notice them cuz I was so busy dancing and trying to focus on what the stranger was trying to talk to me about. But I told her, Bob and friend were just dancing too next to me (we were sort of dancing in a circle). My partner, who was next to me while I was on the phone, heard this and got hella mad. My friend on the phone was mad too and told me they're not good friends. I was little confused but later I understood why.

There was another night I went bar hopping with Bob and friend, where I again got shit faced. I invited my partner to join us after work if he wanted to. To my surprise he did join us but we left soon thereafter because he was mad upon arrival. He was mad because when he came to the bar we were at, he said I was all alone talking to random people and occasionally asking if I knew where my friends were. I don't remember this cuz I was hella drunk. But I didn't really think anything of it. I know my friends didn't necessarily ditch me cuz the bar was crowded. But my partner didnt see it that way.

And that is why he hates Bob (and the other friend).

But because of all this, he really hated it when I hung out with Bob. So I kept cancelling any hangouts I had with Bob. But soon the cancellations piled up and I needed give him a more truthful excuse for why I keep cancelling. But I couldn't tell him to his face that it's because he's a bad friend so my partner hates him and me hanging out with him is putting a strain in our relationship. So I said it's because I don't want to be put in a situation where I might be tempted to cheat on my partner like that one night with the guy putting his hands around my waist. 

So for a while, things were a little weird with Bob. But lately, things were good again and my partner decided to give them another chance (with a lot of persuasion from me). But now after Judy came in the picture, I keep feeling like maybe these people are not a good fit for me. 

I feel like I get an existential crisis after every time I hang out with them and these relationships seem so shallow. I don't feel like I totally belong and also Judy seems like a judgemental bish the more I get to know her. But it takes two to tango so I wonder if I'm the judgemental bish as well. 

Idk how to gradually exit from hanging out with this group of people without offending them or completely losing Bob and other friend's friendship. I could care less about Judgemental Judy. 

Sorry this post was so long. Thank you to those who stuck through until the end.

Here's the story why my partner hates Bob: So a couple months ago, I went clubbing with Bob and another friend. During that time, I was fighting a lot with my partner. So naturally, I went out and got shit faced and danced to forget all the bullshit and also just to have fun of course. That night, there was another guy who came to talk with our group and was flirting with me. Me, a dumb person, continued to talk to him, not sure if I was slurring any words. But it was loud in the club so he leaned closer and was like, ""WHAT?"" so I leaned into his ear and yelled out something I don't remember. But when I did that he put his arms around my waist. I was taken aback and for a second, I gotta admit, I liked it cuz this attention was making me feel sexy. But I'm not a cheater and never plan on being one. So I pulled away and stopped talking to the guy. My friends and I danced some more and then went out to get food from the food stand outside. That's when I hurled up everything I had inside of me from the day I was born. JK but it was gross. That signified the end of my night because now I smelled like vomit and so my partner very kindly picked me up and took my drunk ass home.

The next day, I told my partner what happened and I apologized for flirting with another dude. He said it was okay and that he still loves and trusts me. 

Later that night, I was chatting with a friend over the phone and told her about my club night. She asked me what Bob and the other friend were doing when they saw this random stranger flirting with me when my friends knew that I have a partner. I told her they didn't do anything. I mean I didn't really notice them cuz I was so busy dancing and trying to focus on what the stranger was trying to talk to me about. But I told her, Bob and friend were just dancing too next to me (we were sort of dancing in a circle). My partner, who was next to me while I was on the phone, heard this and got hella mad. My friend on the phone was mad too and told me they're not good friends. I was little confused but later I understood why.

There was another night I went bar hopping with Bob and friend, where I again got shit faced. I invited my partner to join us after work if he wanted to. To my surprise he did join us but we left soon thereafter because he was mad upon arrival. He was mad because when he came to the bar we were at, he said I was all alone talking to random people and occasionally asking if I knew where my friends were. I don't remember this cuz I was hella drunk. But I didn't really think anything of it. I know my friends didn't necessarily ditch me cuz the bar was crowded. But my partner didnt see it that way.

And that is why he hates Bob (and the other friend).

But because of all this, he really hated it when I hung out with Bob. So I kept cancelling any hangouts I had with Bob. But soon the cancellations piled up and I needed give him a more truthful excuse for why I keep cancelling. But I couldn't tell him to his face that it's because he's a bad friend so my partner hates him and me hanging out with him is putting a strain in our relationship. So I said it's because I don't want to be put in a situation where I might be tempted to cheat on my partner like that one night with the guy putting his hands around my waist. 

So for a while, things were a little weird with Bob. But lately, things were good again and my partner decided to give them another chance (with a lot of persuasion from me). But now after Judy came in the picture, I keep feeling like maybe these people are not a good fit for me. 

I feel like I get an existential crisis after every time I hang out with them and these relationships seem so shallow. I don't feel like I totally belong and also Judy seems like a judgemental bish the more I get to know her. But it takes two to tango so I wonder if I'm the judgemental bish as well. 

Idk how to gradually exit from hanging out with this group of people without offending them or completely losing Bob and other friend's friendship. I could care less about Judgemental Judy. 

Sorry this post was so long. Thank you to those who stuck through until the end. 


Update: Judy is not so bad and I think I'm just the judgemental one. Or too sensitive maybe. Idk",1,0,2024-05-31 4:15,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1d4mzjq/new_friend_added_to_group_chat/,Neutral

1. Backgroung of My Misfurtune. 

I started dating this young lady, that I've known for several years in 2020. When I say I've known her before we started a relationship, I'm talking about knowing her from a distance not on a personal level. My judgement of her was based solely on how I perceived her from a distance. She seemed like a collected and well mannered young lady. That is what exactly attracted me to her at the first place, her beautiful personality so I thought. Only If I knew that I was about to make the biggest mistake of my life that would completely ruin and change my life as I knew it. 

Months in our relationship, I came to the realisation that the girl was far from what I thought she was. It turned out she was a pathological lier, blackmailer, and very slow intellectually. Exactly the type of girl that I would not date under any circumstances. In order not to waste our time, I started to plan my exit way out of the relationship without hurting her feelings. I reduced the number of times that I would call her and I stopped inviting her to my place. One day I told her the truth, that I'm no longer interested in the relationship, and it's better we end the relationship since we have been only dating for a few months. And at first she was okey with it, we parted ways. 

2. Things Get Interesting

After being away from her for a month, I received a sms saying that she is pregnant.  At first I did not believe her, so I had to call her to do a pregnant test in person and it was positive. She was pregnant. I had my paternity doubts but I accepted the pregnancy and I told her that I will support the baby and support her during pregnancy but I made myself clear that I did not want a romantic relationship with her. I had paternity doubts because this is the girl that I had sex with only 5 times. Four was with condoms, and one was unprotected sex but we used withdrawal method. 

3. Things Got Worse 

I dont know whether I made a mistake by promising to support her during pregnancy but she took it as if we are back in a romantic relationship. She would demand attention from me, and she would fight girls that people saw me hanging out with. Things were getting out of control to the point that I was led into depression. The drama that she created became the talk of the neighbourhood and this was very embarrasing to me because I held a highly respected job in the community.    

4. The Blackmail 

She started threatening me with ruining my life, saying stuff like either she have me or nobody will have me. I dismissed most of her threats and atributed it to mood swings of a pregnant woman, and I must admit that I was so foolish for dismissing her threats. I shoud've have taken her threat seriously, the earlier the better. 

5. Getting fired from work

One day at work right after morning breafing, the management called me in their office to have a word with me. I knew the management call you in only if you are getting promoted, transfered, served with a warning for misconduct or get fired. I was curious, why the management wanted to talk to me. I entered the office and I was told that my ex girlfriend had reported me at work for sexually abusing her, and to protect the image of the company they would investigate these sexually allegations leveled against me by my ex.  

Some of my co-workers and managers did not like me at all, and the opportunity that they had been waiting for to destroy me has finally presented itself. Also, later along the line, I was informed by one of the manager who was my friend that, it was one of his collegue who told my ex that if she want to hurt me really bad, she should lay false sexual harrassment allegations against me at work. 

6. A Kangaroo Hearing

The girl was not present at the hearing, It was only me, a 29 year old man against a panel of powerful managers and directors. I was told that they don't care whether the allegations are true or false, unfortunately they have no choice but to fire me in order to protect the reputation of the company. The hearing lasted 1 hour, and I was told to leave their work premises. This was September 2020 during the height of pandemic. I packed my bags, and bid farewell to my teary co workers who knew I was innocent. 

7. Shame and Stigma

Here I was, unemployed at 29 during the pandemic, with a tag of sex offender on my neck. I was confused and lost. How would I tell my friends who held me in high regard? How would I tell my mother who spent so much on my education both high school and university? How would the young men in my family who look up to me react? Where can I go from now onwards? Luckly enough neither my friends nor family judged me because they know the type of a person I am. 

8. Poverty and Recovery 

When I lost my job, I literally lost everything. My house and car was repossed, I was literally stripped of everything. I would had been homeless had I not have a supporting family. My married brother had pity on me, and he invited me to stay with him. I was so ashamed of myself being taken care of by another man at age 29 knowing very well that months ago, I was an independent man and I had my life together.  I was ashamed finding myself, sleeping on a matress. I was very shamed of myself that I could not even afford basic stuffs like toiletries. I leaped into depression, withdrew from friends, stayed indoor for 24 hours. I contempleted and attempted suicide several times. I lost weight, and I was ashamed and scared to meet people who knew how I was looking before I lost my job because my body was very emanciated. I looked as if I had been in a hospital for a year. 

In the midst of my hopelessness and depression, I kept praying to God to come at my rescue. In 2022 things started getting better for me. Through a friend, we started a business which is doing fine, eventhough we are not yet where we want to be.  And should everything go according to the plan, next year we plan to extend our opperation to other cities. I can see that God has answeared my prayers, and I must say the future look bright. I've gained weight, started going to the gym and Im starting to regain everything that I lost in 2020.  

9. What About My Son? 

The problem I have is I truly hate this girl with every fibre of my being. Just by the thought of her my mood instantly change. I cant see myself co-parenting with her, after all what she put me through. And if I happen to die, I cant stand the thought of my son sharing his inheritance from me with his mother. I have moved on but I haven't forgiven her, and I dont think I will ever forgive her. It is by God's grace that Im still alive today, because only a few can bounce back from the hell that I have been to.   

Can I move on and completely close that door to start another family, or should I stay with my son and co-parent with the devil?  I need advice from fellow men.

We couldn’t wait to get married and have a family together. We were engaged as well. We broke up over miscommunication. He’s easily influenced and listened to horrible people for advice. That was our first big argument and he gave up on us. 

Last month, he reached out to me apologizing for breaking up with me and how he has regretted it since. He ended a 11 month relationship a week before messaging me. He has always wanted a family and is now in that stage of life where he can start one. However, his ex is 26 and still in college full time. They ended it because he couldn’t see that working any longer. She assumed it was because he was still in love with me. They ended the relationship on good terms. 

For a month, we have been going to couple therapy to try to work on communication so we don’t have a repeat of the last break up. We’re taking things slow but we’re still very much in love. A month after him and his ex breakup, she sends a text apologizing for breaking the no contact rule but she’s pregnant. We’ve been devastated! She’s taken multiple pregnancy tests (positive). Last week she took a blood test and it showed she’s 3-4 weeks pregnant. Which was the very last week they were together. My ex swears he doesn’t remember if he had sex with her the day before he broke up with her. He has caught her talking to her ex during the relationship. He doesn’t know if it’s his or not. All he knows is they wear condoms every time and check for holes. She has been calling him nonstop to get a game plan on how to “split the responsibilities “. I heard their conversation with her saying “I don’t want an abortion or give it up for adoption. I want to raise it with you. Why can’t you meet me today? Is it because you have a date?” Of course I cried because the man I love so much is having a family without me. He has reassured me he still wants me. He doesn’t believe in abortions but has mentioned it to her that it’s an option. She wanted an abortion at first but now she’s keeping it. She got offended by him requesting a dna test as well and threatened to put him on child support if he doesn’t get involved this early on. She agreed to the test but doesn’t know why because it’s his….she said.

We all thought she was lying in the beginning but after the positive tests… we aren’t sure if she’s lying or being honest. My ex told me the last time they had sex was 3/4 months ago. He doesn’t remember the day she claimed which was a Wednesday April 10. They broke up the next day Thursday April 11.

18272,1cdk31m,post,Don’t trust my wife’s fidelity,"I’ve 30m been married over 5 years to my wife 26f. We’re both religious and when I asked to marry her, I asked her mother’s permission first, as her father is deceased. I asked her mother if there’s anything I should worry about, like is she practicing, is she out there etc.
Her mother said no. Her mother was happy to see me asking for her daughter’s hand because her daughter was just coming out of an abusive relationship with 2 children and was a single mother. She knew that I was a good man for her daughter financially, spiritually and emotionally.

So her mother gives the green light and I didn’t detect any red flags… The day after we consummated the marriage, she told me she had sexual relations with another man like a couple months before we were married and that she also had sex again one more time with her abusive ex like a month after that…

I was happy that she was openly honest with me and I brushed it off and said it’s ok don’t worry about it I don’t care.

There’s a lot that has transpired in these past 5 years. 
During our first few months of marriage we had a very active sex life. We even had a baby boy….Everything was going great…then one day, out of no where, she started denying me sex…this went on for some time. A long time. I even asked her what’s going on and why she was denying me. She blamed it on her antidepressants,  she blamed it on having a low sex drive, being tired you name it…well this went on for quite some time and after a while, a while which turned into two years! Yes two years! I was tired of the excuses. I knew that she was bullshitting. It was starting to bother me bad! Real bad and I called her out on it.

I told her “I don’t understand how you can sneak out in the middle of the night while your mother watches your two toddlers while you go and sleep with a random guy you met at the bus stop, meanwhile you keep denying your husband that is raising your daughters as his own! 
I even told her she’s full of it and she’s lying about her excuses because she was still willingly messing around with her abusive ex even after they broke up…
But also…it simply didn’t make sense for a 24yr/old to have that inactive of a sex life…we’re talking two years, no sexual activity…
Either she was master-baiting or getting it from somewhere else..

It just didn’t add up.

I admit I became very sexually frustrated and I said some mean things. We might think a persons past may not matter, or at least I thought so until I knew she was denying me for years and she went out of her way to sleep with a random guy she met at a bus stop and her “abusive ex.”

Here I was raising her two daughters that weren’t even mine, trying to be Prince Charming, captain save a girl, playing step dad. I was More active in her daughter’s life than her baby daddy. And I was coming home to no sex, no home cooked meals and a dirty house. Yes I was the soul bread winner. I was covering all the expenses of the house and the maintenance of the children and her. That means clothes for school, household items, car, phone, rent etc. I’d often find myself coming home from 16hr shifts between school and work and come home assuming something would be cooked and I’d just find myself sitting there hungry. 

I don’t mind cleaning and helping out around the house but I believe there should be a balance. If your spouse is working all day, they should be able to come home to a cooked meal and a clean house or at least a clean room. Instead I was coming home to a dirty house and no food. I would ask her if she could help out by cooking, or keeping up with laundry/cleaning and she’d say
 “I’m not your mother, do it yourself.” 
This would make me upset and she knew it. I’m the type of person to stop asking. So I was basically forced to clean up after her and the kids on days off because I can only live in filth for so long. Not only was she denying me sex for years, we were living like dirt bags while I paid all the bills and did majority of the cleaning. 

Honestly it felt like I was being used to be the kids father and pockets…
One day of really digging in and asking her why she was denying me sex. She said because she wasn’t enjoying having sex with me and that she wasn’t finishing. I’m a very inquisitive guy and ask a lot of questions to maximise my partners pleasure and needs. I love a challenge and I’m very competitive.

So any sexual question you can think of I asked over and over through out our whole marriage and this never came up.

So I asked her why she didn’t say anything, ya know…two years ago when I was asking then. She said she didn’t want to hurt my feelings. This could be true. Or it could have been said out of spite or both could be true.
I’m not an ugly guy by any means, most people would say 9/10 and throughout my life I’ve had many women throw themselves at me only for me to deny them. Even during this 2year dry spell….a beautiful!  light skin, thick classmate threw herself at me and I damn near took the bait! She was a 9 maybe a 10/10 and if I cheated other people would have been like okay, I understand why lol. But I didn’t, I’m not a cheater.

So it’s not an appearance thing by any means with me but I do believe she wasn’t lying about not enjoying sex with me because people have sex with people they want to have sex with. As much as it pains me, that is the truth I had to swallow. I hate to say it but I feel like she gots a kick out of the thrill of having sex with an abuser and a random and she got bored of normally functioning relationship marriage sex(I know that sounds twisted) If I’m being honest with myself I stopped enjoying sex with her as well. She became obese, her flexibility became terrible and she became extremely out of breath and she was just hard to look at. So when we did have sex(once in a great moon) I did 100% of the work and she would just lay there like a walrus. I didn’t enjoy the sexual aspect of it, sure busting a nut feels good but 100% of men finish 100% of the time during sex…but the sex was 2/10 for me as well. I did enjoy the love making/intimacy during sex with my wife, like the touching etc. but the denial, along with the appearance/physical aspect made me loose interest in approaching her sexually.

When I brought up how the denial over two years affected me mentally and she would say stuff like “my psy ain’t the problem and others would agree(meaning here past sexual partners)”… and just other little things to get under my skin, basically add insult to injury. First she doesn’t know how people think. 50% of sex with guys is mental, 25% is looks and the rest is flexibility…I could of said some nasttty mean stuff like “you could imagine.” But I didn’t….thats a line I didn’t or won’t cross….

During all of this, I have my doubts of infidelity because it just simply isn’t normal for an adult to go this long with out sex. Sure women can go long without sex but the longest she went without, prior to me was 3months and went back to her abusive ex for it. So it’s clear that she can’t go that long if she has to go to an abuser for sex. The math ain’t mathing. I even asked her if she would take a lie detector and she said yeah(this was brought up in the hypothetical)

So time goes on and our relationship starts to get better.  Shes going on girls trips with her friends. And we’re raising our family. Then I start to get little red flags that make me raise an eye brow. I question her about certain stuff like where or what she was doing on her trips and she would say to me that she told me the truth about everything. 

I asked her to swear to god on a few different things too. Then one lie would come up, then  another lie would come up, before you know it there were a bunch of lies that I uncovered.
 Basically, I found out about a bunch of lies. I found out that she lied about where she was going and doing a quite few times. I found out that she was going out with her friends out of town to a location that wasn’t where she said she was going to be. I seen a video in her phone where she was half naked in our car, when I asked her about it she said her friends went to a club but she didn’t go in because she felt bad. I’m not buying that lol. I found out that she visited a female friend in another state for a week(which I knew she was going). 

Come to find out there was another man spending the night there and they were all getting hammered together and sleeping together in the same house for a week. There were just tons of red flags that just made me doubt everything about her. I didn’t even wana have sex with her. I also found a conversation in her phone of one of her friend group chats of one of her friends bragging about sleeping with married man that even had a child. It’s one thing to that, do but another thing to openly and comfortably brag about it in a group chat. What got me, is that my wife was being giddy giddy with her friend and hearting her messages when her friend mentioned being a home recker. When I called my wife out on it she’d say “what does my friends psy have to do with you.” 
I know, it doesn’t, I’m more concerned about the company you keep and why my wife was promoting that behaviour….but here she was, gaslighting me….
I also found another conversation in one of her group chats that same friend, enticing my wife to cheat and my wife was hearting the messages and being giddy with her. She even stated she’s looking for a garden tool fit(her work exact words)for next vacay. 

Found a another conversation between her and her mother, with her telling her mother to be careful what she says in front of the ring doorbell so that she doesn’t give out any secrets to me because I can see and hear from it from the door bell. When I asked my wife about all of this, she gas lit me.

So time goes by and I’m having my doubts & she’s able to swear to god that she hasn’t been unfaithful. I don’t trust her “stg” because I caught her  casually lying on Gods name many times. I ask her
again if she’d take a lie detector test and she said yeah. This relieves me.

So….more time goes by and my logical brain coupled with advice from others is starting to over power my “naive love is blind” brain. So I come up with a plan. I set up a date night, take her shopping, spa, hotel & movies. I set a lie detector test appointment up for the next day for her. So the next day comes and we finish breakfast, I tell her. “Listen, you know I’ve been having doubts and I simply don’t trust you at all anymore and I want you to take this lie detector test.” 

She flat out refuses and says “I’m not gonna take it because I feel like, if a relationship has to come to that then it’s over, I know I’m gonna pass it and once I do I’m not gonna want to be in this relationship.”

I called her out on her bluff, and said “okay well take the test, pass it, then leave me.” She got quiet and said to take her home. I gave her an ultimatum, take the test or I divorce her. She just kept quiet and kept asking to go home. She does this thing where she likes to play victim. I admit , a lie detector test is a bit much but she’s sus af. 
And if it does come to that then the relationship should be over but she has absolutely no right to say that because she’s the dishonest one, not me, so it doesn’t make sense for her to say that, if anyone should be saying that it’s me….

“I said okay….thats the decision you want to make…”and I drove her home without her taking the test & I stayed in a friends house for a couple of weeks. 

During this time she played on my sympathy strings and got me back, ascertained me that she would “never cheat.” I shut down my logical brain and went back…..

Time goes by, I’m still seeing red flags and my logical brain is like buddy!! She needs to take this test!

 It makes it worse that she said she would take the test but when it came to actually taking a test she backed out and came up with an excuse. 
It’s almost like confirmation for me. Yeah I could see if a person had high standards and morals and how they would be absolutely offended by a test but here’s the thing, she doesn’t have high morals or standards. You can’t have high standards and simultaneously promote home wrecker behavior. 

It also doesn’t make sense that she says “if it comes to that then I feel like the relationship is over.” Because it has come to that and I already questioned her fidelity so if that statement were true then she would have already left, but she didn’t. Also what doesn’t add up is that she’s willing to swear on our holy book, her deceased father and our kids but she absolutely refuses to take a test. Doesn’t make sense. The only difference between stg on stuff vs a lie detector test is that she can easily lie when stg on something. But the premise of both are the same. For someone to refuse a test they would pass doesn’t make sense unless they knew they were gonna fail.

So here’s where we’re at now. I do have love for her, the sexual history and lying built some animosity but we’ve gotten better sexually n better with communication. More importantly I don’t want our children to grow up in a broken home. Shes learned to become a better wife and I a better husband. I feel like part of the reason she became a better wife is because she knows I’m a good man, she loves me, she knows she jacked up, she doesn’t want to loose a father to her daughters(ya I’d be there but not at the same capacity) and she knows she’s in jeopardy of loosing me. I also feel like she’s becoming better in hopes that I’ll forget about asking for a test.

Believe me, I tried to just move on and sweep everything under the rug but my logical brain won’t let me. And I refuse to live in doubt any longer.

So I gave her an ultimatum again. Take the test or divorce. Either she takes the test and passes or fails idk. Or she doesn’t take the test and I divorce her. Either way, I refuse to continue to always live in doubt and mistrust.
I gave her 2 months to decide. The two month deadline is approaching soon and I’ll update when I can.","Don’t trust my wife’s fidelity 


I’ve 30m been married over 5 years to my wife 26f. We’re both religious and when I asked to marry her, I asked her mother’s permission first, as her father is deceased. I asked her mother if there’s anything I should worry about, like is she practicing, is she out there etc.
Her mother said no. Her mother was happy to see me asking for her daughter’s hand because her daughter was just coming out of an abusive relationship with 2 children and was a single mother. She knew that I was a good man for her daughter financially, spiritually and emotionally.

So her mother gives the green light and I didn’t detect any red flags… The day after we consummated the marriage, she told me she had sexual relations with another man like a couple months before we were married and that she also had sex again one more time with her abusive ex like a month after that…

I was happy that she was openly honest with me and I brushed it off and said it’s ok don’t worry about it I don’t care.

There’s a lot that has transpired in these past 5 years. 
During our first few months of marriage we had a very active sex life. We even had a baby boy….Everything was going great…then one day, out of no where, she started denying me sex…this went on for some time. A long time. I even asked her what’s going on and why she was denying me. She blamed it on her antidepressants,  she blamed it on having a low sex drive, being tired you name it…well this went on for quite some time and after a while, a while which turned into two years! Yes two years! I was tired of the excuses. I knew that she was bullshitting. It was starting to bother me bad! Real bad and I called her out on it.

I told her “I don’t understand how you can sneak out in the middle of the night while your mother watches your two toddlers while you go and sleep with a random guy you met at the bus stop, meanwhile you keep denying your husband that is raising your daughters as his own!

18274,1c7i1e8,post,"The woman that I loved left me, and I feel kinda relived ","So I was in a relationship with a woman I met during COVID. It was near the end of 2020, my dreams of studying abroad was crushed and was pretty clueless in life. I also found out earlier that year that my ex who I was going to propose is getting married to someone else and kept me as a side piece.

I was pretty devasted mentally when I met her, and honestly wasn't expecting anything more than one date. But then as we started talking she too opened up about her life, her abusive ex left her with pretty horrible trauma that sounded like PTSD to me but I'm no professional and she refused to get professional help.

But I can understand where the mistrust comes from, there are too many therapists who are just in it for the money and can be more damaging to talk to, having experienced my fair share of them.

We were doing great initially. We used to meet pretty often and even though I was struggling financially I'd try to get her small gifts and take her out on dates. She too loved it, and sometimes took me out on dates as well.

In 2021, during the second wave, she moved back to her hometown and things started to change a bit. I was going through a hard time and needed someone to talk to, and she was there, but she was never there to listen anymore. She would tell me about her day and then hang up. 

Then one day she calls me up, crying, because her friends who she would go on and on about all the time had ghosted her. 

Something snapped in me that day, all I wanted was someone to talk to, someone I can be vulnerable with, someone to whom I don't have to put on a show for but she never had time for that but now she wants me to sympathize because her friends are hanging out without her, I didn't say anything to her though, I felt it wouldn't go through to her and I really did love her, I didn't wanna do that to her.

I had to move cities soon after because I enrolled in a program in my country which I wasn't really expecting to get into anyway. And that definitely didn't help. I was in a new city where I have never been to before and didn't know anyone. And on top of that a demanding program, internships, and with a million different deadlines I barely had time to eat or sleep. I couldn't call back for days sometimes and then when I got the time to talk she would fight with me for not calling her back sooner or informing her I was busy.


Honestly, the time between when I met her and when I left for my further studies I had a huge impact in her life. When I met her she was abusing lithium tablets to cope with her daily life. I helped her turn her life around, she's now doing pretty well, is on her way towards getting a doctorate. I helped her write several research papers that we worked on together while I was doing my regular work. I helped her be what she is today and she recognises as much. She always told me that I was the light at the end of the tunnel at a very difficult time of her life.

Any way, after I got my degree I started my job as a consultant. I think it's no secret that consultants work crazy hours and that didn't help the situation either. On top of that I had to move to another city again.

Recently I noticed that everything that comes out of my mouth she seemed to hate it. I didn't know what to do about it. I told her, half jokingly that she doesn't like me or anything that I have to say.
She laughed it off at the time, but calls me a couple of days later, and tells me that she feels guilty for being the way she is with me because I have been the perfect boyfriend but she gets angry at everything that I say or do, and that if we don't talk it'll be better for her.

I don't know, may be she's envious of me? She stopped working on research papers with me because I am better informed about certain things than her, even on the subject she has a masters degree on. But I was never condescending, I love sharing what I know, I find so many things so wonderful that I read up on them and share with whoever is willing to listen, there's no malice on my part I believe and I think she knew that.

I don't know how to process this, I don't know how to feel. I live alone in a different city from where I grew up in, also a different city from where I did my program. I don't know anyone in this city besides my colleagues who are not really friendly with me outside of work. I have a very stressful job and life in general. I loved listening to her laugh whenever I got the time. I loved to hear her complain about banal shit in life like her cat not wanting to cuddle with her. 

I had for a long time envisioned a life with her, and now it seems like I'm back to square 1 after almost 4 years.

And no I wasn't perfect, I forgot valentine's day a couple of times and her birthday once. Although I did get her the gift she wanted, it was pretty expensive but I just wanted her to be happy. There were also times when didn't appreciate or was rather rude to her, like on our first anniversary because she was late and changed the entire plan I made for us. But I get really stressed out if there's a set plan and things don't go that way and I don't find out until the end. I really don't handle surprises well. But I tried my best to not let her feel that way again, I was upset and stressed but it didn't have to come on to her.

Last time we were together she got mad at me for looking at the phone while she was getting dressed in front of me, but honestly I needed to be quite for a little while, we have been together for 14/15 hours at that point, talking the whole time while doing other things.She got offended by it when I said I needed to be quite for a while.
The time before that, she wanted to break up with me because I didn't want to have sex with her. For context I was visiting my parents, I had a 26 hour train journey and then since she didn't want to see my parents (they love her and asked her if we're thinking about marriage and somehow that offended her)so she made me travel 40+km/25 miles in 40°/104° and then when I tried to give her the flowers I got her, she told me to keep them on her desk and didn't even look at them.

I feel relieved but at times I get incredibly sad. Relieved because my clients do not scrutinize every sentence that I speak as much as she did, I feel that they are more empathetic to my challenges than she was although I know that's just professionalism. But honestly all I wanted was peace.
But her laughter was the only thing that I had left that still made me happy, my paycheck or anything else for that matter doesn't have that impact on me. 

Sorry for the long post.

TLDR: My long term girlfriend left me, kinda sad kinda relived about it 
","The woman that I loved left me, and I feel kinda relived  So I was in a relationship with a woman I met during COVID. It was near the end of 2020, my dreams of studying abroad was crushed and was pretty clueless in life. I also found out earlier that year that my ex who I was going to propose is getting married to someone else and kept me as a side piece.

I was pretty devasted mentally when I met her, and honestly wasn't expecting anything more than one date. But then as we started talking she too opened up about her life, her abusive ex left her with pretty horrible trauma that sounded like PTSD to me but I'm no professional and she refused to get professional help.

But I can understand where the mistrust comes from, there are too many therapists who are just in it for the money and can be more damaging to talk to, having experienced my fair share of them.

We were doing great initially. We used to meet pretty often and even though I was struggling financially I'd try to get her small gifts and take her out on dates. She too loved it, and sometimes took me out on dates as well.

In 2021, during the second wave, she moved back to her hometown and things started to change a bit. I was going through a hard time and needed someone to talk to, and she was there, but she was never there to listen anymore. She would tell me about her day and then hang up. 

Then one day she calls me up, crying, because her friends who she would go on and on about all the time had ghosted her. 

Something snapped in me that day, all I wanted was someone to talk to, someone I can be vulnerable with, someone to whom I don't have to put on a show for but she never had time for that but now she wants me to sympathize because her friends are hanging out without her, I didn't say anything to her though, I felt it wouldn't go through to her and I really did love her, I didn't wanna do that to her.

I had to move cities soon after because I enrolled in a program in my country which I wasn't really expecting to get into anyway. And that definitely didn't help. I was in a new city where I have never been to before and didn't know anyone. And on top of that a demanding program, internships, and with a million different deadlines I barely had time to eat or sleep. I couldn't call back for days sometimes and then when I got the time to talk she would fight with me for not calling her back sooner or informing her I was busy.


Honestly, the time between when I met her and when I left for my further studies I had a huge impact in her life. When I met her she was abusing lithium tablets to cope with her daily life. I helped her turn her life around, she's now doing pretty well, is on her way towards getting a doctorate. I helped her write several research papers that we worked on together while I was doing my regular work. I helped her be what she is today and she recognises as much. She always told me that I was the light at the end of the tunnel at a very difficult time of her life.

Any way, after I got my degree I started my job as a consultant. I think it's no secret that consultants work crazy hours and that didn't help the situation either. On top of that I had to move to another city again.

Recently I noticed that everything that comes out of my mouth she seemed to hate it. I didn't know what to do about it. I told her, half jokingly that she doesn't like me or anything that I have to say.

D and I became friends on Facebook and eventually started to hang out. D knew that I had a crush on him, and he would say that he was into me, but would never make things official with me, which I now realize was likely due to our age. That didn’t stop any of his advances, though. He made me promise him that when I turned 18, and if we were both single, we would get married (side note: he actually contacted me when I was 18 and got offended/sad when I told him that I wasn’t going to keep a promise I made when I was 13).

I moved away shortly after, and we never really kept in touch (aside from him reaching out when I was 18). 

Looking back, I feel like he should’ve known better than to fool around with a 14 year old. Granted, I should’ve know better too, but at the time I was a troubled teen that was desperate for attention (which I’m not proud to admit). I really think he saw a vulnerable younger girl and created someone to be obsessed with him. He went through a lot of relationships, and each time he had a breakup, he would immediately reach out to me and would be flirty. I really think he would show me romantic attention to keep me around for when a new girlfriend fell through. He knew I’d always be there. 

I cringe when I think of our friendship. I hate that I fooled around with an ADULT at 14 years old. I feel disgusting that the same adult would willingly fool around with a 14 year old.

18276,1bvfeai,post,I hate my neighbor and it affects my quality of life. ,"I love my cute little house and it's yard. I've grown into it quite a lot since moving in.
Its quite small and has it quirks, though one of them being the houses are too close together and everyone's living spaces lining up. 

When I first noticed my neighbor staring into my house, I was sitting on my bed feeling like I was being watched and I tried to brush it off, but I looked around and there he was, smoking a cigarette staring into the room. NOT IN A PEEPING TOM WAY BUT IN A FUCK THIS IS BAD HOW TBIS LINES UP, WE SHOULD CHANGE THE WINDOW PLACEMENT OR THE CHAIR HE SMOKES ON. 

A couple weeks later, I can't remember why but my boyfriend mentioned looking at the sex offenders list for a neighborhood he was working in and I said ""why? We didn't even look at ours before we moved in"" 
Low and behold the neighbor next door is on the list. 
Now, I try and avoid him even more but he's had a stroke in the past couple of years and lives with his older mother in his childhood home. 

Though the problem is we both like gardening and often times I will have to physically turn my body so I have my back to their house, even if it's easier to face that way because, again, our houses are close together but our backyards are long and narrow. 

Now, as I'm writing this, another neighbor down the long block is shooting off his gun. He does this every once in a while and apparently it's the same guy per our neighborhood group because every time, there's a post about how we should take away his guns. 

It's just stressful but I love my home, my garden and my cheap cost of living here. ","I hate my neighbor and it affects my quality of life.  I love my cute little house and it's yard. I've grown into it quite a lot since moving in.

18278,1bsdkio,post,No contact with spouse 7 days and counting,"TL;DR - My [30M] spouse [30F] and I had a falling out and she has been staying with her best friend and hasn’t spoken to me for a week.

Throwaway for obvious reasons. I can’t share this with any family or friends so I will share my story here. 

Currently my partner [30F] has been staying with her best friend and hasn’t talked to me [30M] since seven days ago. She told me she wanted space to “figure things out.” I’ve been hoping she’d come home each night since then but I’ve been afraid to message or check in for fear of “not respecting space.”

We have been together for 6 years, married for 2 years. When we met, we both had abusive partners and we left our respective partners for each other. During those first few years, I caused damage — bordering on traumatic —  to our relationship because of my addictions to sex and pornography. She told me she would only stay with me if I went to therapy and quit porn. I went to therapy for several years, worked the steps in the program, and even included her in my recovery. 

My one regret is that we continued to have regular sex while I was beginning my recovery. My therapist advised against it but when I tried to suggest a break from sex while I “rebooted” she got really insecure. Eventually we would stop having sex all together years later, and I believe that is in part to how we handled things during recovery.

Fast forward three years and my mom gets diagnosed with cancer and dies six months later. Grief got between me and my partner, and she began to use it as an excuse to not be intimate with me. She told me I was taking out my emotions on her in my mourning. I tried to check myself when connecting with her, but this space between us only grew in the years following my grief.

We lived together during lockdown and actually grew a little closer being around each other all day every day. I read all the articles of people divorcing during lockdown because they realized they couldn’t stand each other, so I thought we were doing well. Our sex life had waned, but we were in better places in our careers, and wanted to get married, so I proposed to her and she said yes. 

During our engagement, my partner decided to seek help for her mental health, thinking she may have a disorder. I was always a denier when it came to labeling disorders or taking prescription medications, and it hurt her to think I didn’t believe her or support her. Turned out she has Bipolar Disorder and ADHD, and she began taking medication. I quickly changed my stance and wanted to support her, but damage was already dealt.

The month before our wedding, my partner confronted me that she found a tinder profile using my photos under a different name. I was completely blindsided by this and felt violated that someone had used photos from my socials to catfish people. My partner didn’t believe me. I locked down all my private information but part of her still thought I was trying to cheat on her. We decided to move forward with the wedding.

The weeks leading up to our wedding were blissful nonetheless. Of course there was some drama and pressures from family to make everything work for everyone, but the week of our wedding was the happiest week of my life. I was worried that we wouldn’t make love on our wedding night because of how our sex life had dissipated back during our grief. All of that seemed to fall away and we reconnected and made love like when we first fell for each other. 

After our honeymoon, life returned to normal. We were intimate once or twice in the months that followed before falling off completely. Work became stressful for both of us. I tried to make time for us, but then a pattern of rejection began to rise. First, it was verbally rejecting sex, saying she was tired or feeling bad. Next it was not wanting to cuddle. Then it was not holding hands anymore. I would get upset and protest, but nothing would change. 

Six months after our wedding, things came to a head when I tried to give her a hug and 
She snapped at me and yelled she didn’t want to be touched. I told her right then that I would stop trying, that the ball would be in her court. I was tired of being rejected. In the months that followed, she missed every holiday we could spend together. She missed my birthday, valentines, our anniversary. She asked me what I wanted for Christmas the week before. I told her I didn’t get her anything and I didn’t want anything because the whole year was one sided and I didn’t want to get a thoughtless gift from her out of obligation. 

Around this time, she began spending more time with her best friend in her free time. Her best friend is a partnered lesbian, which would otherwise be not worth mentioning. My past relationship had cheated on me with a mutual female friend, and I had irrational fears that my wife was doing the same. I confronted her when we had a day off together and she told me she didn’t want to do anything, but then jumped at the chance to hang out with her best friend. I told her this had made me so insecure that I had thoughts that she was cheating on me with her best friend, even though she has always claimed to be heterosexual. She denied my accusation and said I was being irrational, and she was offended that I even thought it could be true. 

Since the beginning of this year, she has told me she simply doesn’t feel comfortable being around me. She says that I don’t make our home or our relationship feel secure. She says that she doesn’t want to be around me and that I am jealous of the time she spends with her friends and that I need to find more friends to connect with, that she can’t be my only close friend. 

About two weeks ago we had a fight that began over leftover food. I offered to make dinner the night before but she decided to go out with her best friend instead and told me I didn’t need to make anything for her. I saved a portion for me to eat the next day, and when I told her she couldn’t have it, she flew off the handle saying she can’t even eat food she helps pay for. It felt like she was having a manic episode but I didn’t make that argument. I simply poured my heart out about how lonely I am in our marriage, and how much I want marriage counseling but she keeps refusing. The argument ended with me being late for work and me walking away feeling very hurt and disappointed. 

I chose to not message her, out of protest for how I feel. She would spend two nights with her best friend, then come home one night and go straight to bed. Last Sunday she came by to pick up a change of clothes for work, then she told me to have a good day. I haven’t seen or talked to her since. 

I want to message her today, simply to ask how she’s doing or when she will come home. I don’t know if it’s better to continue this radio silence, to consider us separated (that would break my heart.) or to “chase” after her to show how invested I am. What if she’s been waiting for me to beg her to come back? Our lease renews in two weeks unless we terminate and I don’t even know what the future holds for us.

TL;DR - My [30M] spouse [30F] and I had a falling out and she has been staying with her best friend and hasn’t spoken to me for a week.

I told her I didn’t get her anything and I didn’t want anything because the whole year was one sided and I didn’t want to get a thoughtless gift from her out of obligation. 

Around this time, she began spending more time with her best friend in her free time. Her best friend is a partnered lesbian, which would otherwise be not worth mentioning. My past relationship had cheated on me with a mutual female friend, and I had irrational fears that my wife was doing the same. I confronted her when we had a day off together and she told me she didn’t want to do anything, but then jumped at the chance to hang out with her best friend. I told her this had made me so insecure that I had thoughts that she was cheating on me with her best friend, even though she has always claimed to be heterosexual. She denied my accusation and said I was being irrational, and she was offended that I even thought it could be true. 

Since the beginning of this year, she has told me she simply doesn’t feel comfortable being around me. She says that I don’t make our home or our relationship feel secure. She says that she doesn’t want to be around me and that I am jealous of the time she spends with her friends and that I need to find more friends to connect with, that she can’t be my only close friend. 

About two weeks ago we had a fight that began over leftover food. I offered to make dinner the night before but she decided to go out with her best friend instead and told me I didn’t need to make anything for her. I saved a portion for me to eat the next day, and when I told her she couldn’t have it, she flew off the handle saying she can’t even eat food she helps pay for. It felt like she was having a manic episode but I didn’t make that argument. I simply poured my heart out about how lonely I am in our marriage, and how much I want marriage counseling but she keeps refusing. The argument ended with me being late for work and me walking away feeling very hurt and disappointed. 

I chose to not message her, out of protest for how I feel. She would spend two nights with her best friend, then come home one night and go straight to bed. Last Sunday she came by to pick up a change of clothes for work, then she told me to have a good day. I haven’t seen or talked to her since. 

I want to message her today, simply to ask how she’s doing or when she will come home. I don’t know if it’s better to continue this radio silence, to consider us separated (that would break my heart.) or to “chase” after her to show how invested I am. What if she’s been waiting for me to beg her to come back? Our lease renews in two weeks unless we terminate and I don’t even know what the future holds for us.

TL;DR - My [30M] spouse [30F] and I had a falling out and she has been staying with her best friend and hasn’t spoken to me for a week.

I have only ever slept with one other person before him and it was with a condom and it was really gross and overall just not a good time. I didn’t even know the person. I was just super lonely and depressed at the time and needed someone to hangout with and I was pressured into it. 

Anyway, my boyfriend basically thinks I cheated on him, and I quite literally broke down because this is not true. I would never do something like that and I am quite literally just not capable of doing that. 

He said he believes me but wants to be cautious now due to the circumstances which really really hurts because he’s been cheated on in the past and has trust issues and I was really making progress with him and being patient with him when he would accuse me of other things/be toxic. 

I just don’t know what to do. I feel devastated. I read somewhere that you can get a false negative if you pee before your test or take antibiotics and he said he never did any of those things. I have been crying all day and even had to leave work.

Edit: I did not cheat. I am not a cheater and the worst part is no one is believing me but Im telling the truth. I feel like Im going insane.

Edit: Texted him and asked to see his results. Will update you all. Ive already started taking my antibiotics, so I doubt I can do a retest. He has also taken several days worth of antibiotics as well.

Update: Spoke with him some more and he doesn’t believe that I could get it three years ago and not know by now (basically accusing me of lying, again). I finally snapped and told him that it was literally most likely his fault because he’s had seven partners and he just so happened to test negative. He told me that I was apparently blaming him and saying this is all his fault. I asked to see his results and he was offended but he agreed to go back to the doctor and get them. His appointment is tomorrow. He’s going to try and get retested even though he’s taken two days worth of antibiotics. I’m basically being treated like shit and he seems really hurt but i didn’t do anything wrong. He even told me that his stomach was hurting and that he feels sick and that usually that’s a sign for him that he’s right about something. I told him that that is just a fucking physiological response to stress because you can’t be “right” about something that never fucking happened. I then proceeded to tell him that I’ve made peace with whatever happens because at the end of the day I did not do anything wrong, I am telling the truth, and whether he chooses to believe his partner is on him.

18280,1bhjrpk,post,I worry nobody in my life will believe me because I'm a guy.,"Warning for assault.

Made a throwaway because this is eating me up inside and there's nobody in my life I can tell. I (now 18M) was sexually harassed for almost three years by someone who was meant to be my friend. We met through a mutual friend and I thought that this was just what friendship was like as you got older. I thought that maybe it was okay. She always told me she wasn't ""actually into me"", so it was 'fine', and I didn't want to come off as ""sensitive"" or ""overdramatic"". I didn't want to be the ""scary guy"" no girl can ever trust or the guy who ""can't take a joke"". I didn't want to say anything. I didn't want to make a scene. So I didn't.

But it didn't matter how much she swore she ""wasn't into me"". She'd call me sometimes and ask if she 'caught me in the middle of it'. That's how it started. Those sorts of comments that don't explicitly say something sexual so that there's deniability, but it can't mean anything else. I was 16 back then. Sometimes she'd get upset about how often I hung around my (now-ex) boyfriend instead of talking to her. She'd joke asking if she could 'watch' when he stayed at my place. I chewed her out about this at the time but she kept insisting it was 'just a joke' despite the fact she still continuously suggested we must be fucking every time I ended the call. Every time I brought him up. Every time we so much as did anything together, and I'd say anything about it. It was weird. Uncomfortable. I felt ashamed and dirty and I was/still am struggling with my relation to sex and what I want (I was raised very religious; sex was a big no and especially being gay it's hard to navigate how I feel about it). I still told myself that it must just be her sense of humor, or something. That I'd 'be a buzzkill' for having discomforts.

As time went on she started sending pics of the suggestive nature when I was 17. I keep blaming myself for having not cut if off here but at the time I told myself I was overthinking it. I must be looking into it wrong. I must be the creep, not her. Pictures can be innocent. Bodies are just skin. And she said she wasn't into me. She always had. I'd learn later that she lied, but back then, I was in 'ignorant bliss' that wasn't actually very blissful. I never replied to anything she sent, never drew attention to it; I'd just change topics. She always pressured me to send something back. She said I was 'boring' if I didn't, that I was 'offending her' by not 'trusting her'. Sometimes I'd send selfies. She'd speak sexually about them, hastily throw on it was 'in a friend way', of course. I'd always hate those photos after.

She was very physical, in person. Even more so when I broke up with my now-ex. She said it was just 'who she was'. But she always kept moving my hands where I didn't want them. She kept moving HER hands where I didn't want them to be. She'd 'joke' about kissing me. She'd ask if I'd 'like her if I was into girls'. She'd ask if I'd 'be into her if she was a guy'. And then I'd feel her breathe on my neck. And one day it wasn't a joke anymore, because it never really was, and I could suddenly no longer give benefit of the doubt. I didn't say yes. I never did. I didn't do anything back. I didn't enjoy it at all. But I didn't say no. I just froze. Leaned away, until I couldn't. I was terrified. And I still wouldn't realize how fucked it all was for another four months.

I wanted to believe she'd never hurt me. Subconsciously, I felt the need to protect her. I don't know why. I still can't figure out why. I think that's why I never said anything while it was going on; that, and the fact that she had a habit, I found, of shit-talking ex-friends of hers, painting herself as the perfect victim, who 'everyone leaves' because she's 'so unlovable' and 'oh, I'm such a bad friend, you make me feel so stupid, why do you even talk to me,' et cetera. She hurt me so bad and yet I'm still the one who felt sorry for her. It feels so careless of me when I lay it all out. All of the red flags were as obvious and as bright as can be, but I swear to you, what difference does it make when the lawn they're on is green? When someone who insists they're such a good friend to you says they want what's best? When they swear you're the only one to ever 'get' them? When they make you feel like everything and nothing at the same time? There were good times; there really were. A lot happens in three years. You'd overlook anything if it meant you didn't have to change routine. At least, I did.

Maybe it felt safer, knowing what was going to happen, even if it was going to be bad. She'd never say 'sorry', but she'd play games with me after, and shower me in compliments, and it's easy to mistake it for good intentions and care when she'd played the game so well from the start. Walking on eggshells became a new normal. It was better than the absence, or, so I thought at the time.

I couldn't find the strength to leave until I was hospitalized last month (I've fully recovered now, don't worry). I'd run out of the physical and mental strength to keep pretending she didn't make me sick to my stomach, and it took my injuries to finally find a 'good enough' reason to ignore her for the day, pretend she didn't exist, focus on the fact I wasn't okay instead of worrying about her and her judgement and seeing her in person.

And then one day turned into a week, and that turned into two, and I realized that the world hadn't ended, that it wasn't turning on me, that life could go on even if she was no longer in my life.

So I blocked her. On everything. And it's like I can finally breathe again.

I never drew attention to what she did to me. I never said anything. I wish I could shout at her. Scream at her. I wish I could make everyone realize just the sort of person she is. I wish I could ensure she never does it to anyone again. I wish it hadn't happened at all. I wish I could get my time back. I wish it didn't hit me in waves. I think that's why I'm here; nobody will know her name or her face or that it's me specifically she hurt, but it's out there. Documented. Solid, somewhere. I'll never have to see her again. Never have to talk to her again. We don't even have mutual friends. It's the smoothest cut-off I can make. But fuck, man. I feel too much shame to tell anyone I'm close to. I feel like I'm still 'overreacting' and a part of me still doubts if it even all 'counts'. I'm not even sure how coherent this all is. Maybe it all sounds like bullshit by the time I've typed it all out.

I don't think it matters. I just want to be heard (and maybe someone out there will feel less alone).","I worry nobody in my life will believe me because I'm a guy. Warning for assault.

 ","DID MY MOM HAD DOUBTS? 

When I was a teenager (14 years old)my mother moved us to another city and the owner of the apartment raped my sister and I am convinced that my mother knew or had doubts.


To put you in context once again we were 4 children ,(not all from the same father ).My mother met a man on a dating site and quickly they became a couple.We then moved with him to a small town . I was 14 , my brother 13 and my two little sisters were 11 and 8 months old. The owner had 2 building side by side, he was literally our neighbor.Everything goes so well at first, the owner in question had a girlfriend who had two children,A 16-year-old girl and a 13-year-old girl, everything was fine at the beginning until her two people separate. One of these girls had accused the man in question of having touched her in an innapropriate way. Her mother never believed her and they moved afterwards.

My mother and father-in-law have never been exemplary parents on countless things they have done to us I could write a novel about it,I know more how it started but there was this little deal that if helped the owner in small tasks on the properties that belonged to him they brought us to do activities such as ,cinema ,sailboat etc. It often ended up sleeping at his house camping in the living room. I started to have doubts about this person after an event that I will find suspicious.A weekend I went to see a friend and my brother and my sister had been doing an activity with this person.When they came back that weekend ,the owner asked my mother if he could do an activity alone with me since I had missed thisI do not know why but I had the feeling that it was not normal and so I refused.My mother insisted that I go but I told her it was strange and then she remained blind.

I remember more if it was before or after this event that what I will describe to you it happened. One evening we went to sleep at his place because it was a home cinema evening they had organized for us. I can’t remember the movie we listened to. I was sleeping on the sofa and my brother and sister were sleeping in a sleeping bag on the living room floor.


I woke up and something happened and I always blamed myself for not having realized earlier.when I opened my eyes I saw the man takes a blanket and this lying next to my sister .. I went back to sleep and the next morning everything seemed normal except that at one point my sister said she was bleeding when she was going to pee.


A few months later ,my mother picked us up from school.... my sister had spoken and told the mother of one of her friends that this person had raped her.


We were questioned and moved, and the owner in question took 1 year of prison at home and is now registered on the list of sex offenders without more.

Did my mother have any doubts? 
Since my mother is so narcissistic, is it veiled to have peace the hours we were not there?
I’ll never get an answer. It still haunt me today.

18282,1avj914,post,"Just the ramblings of someone dealing with a lot, to whom may be concerned..","I know this'll all sound crazy as heck to some so bear with me okay.

Okay so...I like to write, or more of I like the dreaming up and planning part of writing. I love writing stories it's what I love, and I see characters as part of me, as different ways to see different people, and to change them, even a little, feels wrong for me and I love so very dearly to write without anything holding me back.

but I'm catholic, so unfortunately freedom isn't allowed for me. and if you're catholic in the comments and that offends you, I'm glad that being around God is so easy for you and I hope it keeps being that way but it's not for me. I feel like I'm suffocating under it, like I'm in an arranged marriage with someone I've never met, is all powerful, has all the answers no matter how contradictory they sound and who I keep being told loves me so, but I feel more like a servant than a loved one. and if you're thinking "" Just leave Catholicism then"" yeah, one does not simply walk out of Christianity. it's a foundation, my whole world, I can't get rid of, without it, who am I, where do I belong, there's too much ingrained to just rip it all up from the roots. so here I stay till it's easier.

and yeah, sometimes I tend to add this part of me to my writing (I mean I don't have a choice, everting's got to be done cos of God or whatever, so he's got to get his honorable mention.) I never liked religious entertainment. it just...bothers me a little. the correct word actually is sickens me, it sickens me. I just feel deep loathing when I see it on the billboards, on flyers, in my face, me who's supposed to be lapping it all up, like you I know I can't leave, and that I'm always wrong in your eyes and have gazillions of rules to follow, but being all over the place when I'm trying to get away from you is fucked up. 

so, the real reason I'm writing all this message is cos I'm in a dilemma. I have a character, Carmen, Shes Hispanic, catholic (and no I can't write it out, it's just a part of her and ...I just can't okay) but doesn't want kids. and since she doesn't want kids, she can't be married, cos in Christianity you have no say in the matter, you want to get married you have to have kids, you can't weasel out of it. 

this is personal to me cos I don't want kids and I'm catholic, so I can't get married unless I swallow down my convictions, push down my feelings about kids, and pop out a few I don't even want. but it's fine as I don't want to be married either, marriage had never appealed to me and sex appeals to me less, like waaaaaayyyy less. sure, I'd like to have someone who loves me back as much as i love them, but I've never felt a need to, so it just stays a fun fantasy. 

but I want her to find love, and in the story, she does fall for a guy but has to battle with her choices to not have kids and her faith and wanting to be with someone forever is basically impossible as she tries to keep to her religion the best she can.  


so that's as much as I can say, I don't know who'll read this, but I'm tired of keeping this turmoil to myself, cos she's like a part of me, so if she can find love and succeed then I can too i guess, but if religion does get in her journey, then I have to accept that, don't I?","Just the ramblings of someone dealing with a lot, to whom may be concerned.. I know this'll all sound crazy as heck to some so bear with me okay.

Okay so...I like to write, or more of I like the dreaming up and planning part of writing. I love writing stories it's what I love, and I see characters as part of me, as different ways to see different people, and to change them, even a little, feels wrong for me and I love so very dearly to write without anything holding me back.

but I'm catholic, so unfortunately freedom isn't allowed for me. and if you're catholic in the comments and that offends you, I'm glad that being around God is so easy for you and I hope it keeps being that way but it's not for me. I feel like I'm suffocating under it, like I'm in an arranged marriage with someone I've never met, is all powerful, has all the answers no matter how contradictory they sound and who I keep being told loves me so, but I feel more like a servant than a loved one. and if you're thinking "" Just leave Catholicism then"" yeah, one does not simply walk out of Christianity. it's a foundation, my whole world, I can't get rid of, without it, who am I, where do I belong, there's too much ingrained to just rip it all up from the roots. so here I stay till it's easier.

and yeah, sometimes I tend to add this part of me to my writing (I mean I don't have a choice, everting's got to be done cos of God or whatever, so he's got to get his honorable mention.) I never liked religious entertainment. it just...bothers me a little. the correct word actually is sickens me, it sickens me. I just feel deep loathing when I see it on the billboards, on flyers, in my face, me who's supposed to be lapping it all up, like you I know I can't leave, and that I'm always wrong in your eyes and have gazillions of rules to follow, but being all over the place when I'm trying to get away from you is fucked up. 

so, the real reason I'm writing all this message is cos I'm in a dilemma. I have a character, Carmen, Shes Hispanic, catholic (and no I can't write it out, it's just a part of her and ...I just can't okay) but doesn't want kids. and since she doesn't want kids, she can't be married, cos in Christianity you have no say in the matter, you want to get married you have to have kids, you can't weasel out of it.

18283,1as52m3,post,This Was Not on My 2024 Bingo Card. Fr Tho Just Now Getting Over My Panic Attack.,"So I dated this guy in 2022, shortly before I got with my now partner (I actually chose him over my partner. I met them at the same time)
He seemed to be the sweetest man I had ever met, very gentle and meek. He met my daughter, took us to the fair and to the park and stuff. 
So shortly into our relationship he told me about losing his 2 month old baby girl to SIDS. The man practically cried on my shoulder because he couldn't save her and I felt awful for him, I couldn't imagine losing my child. 
The relationship ran its course and I'd always thought of him as one of the nicest men I've dated. 
Until tonight.
I was looking through a local news page on Facebook because I'm bored at work and what did I find?
This sick fuck that I cared for and let meet my baby girl, just plead guilty to and got convicted of murdering his newborn baby. And if that's not bad enough this 2 month old baby had signs of prolonged abuse, several broken bones, and a brain bleed. How it took 3 years to get a conviction I don't know. 
So after I sit there reeling over this I look into the case an find that he's also a REGISTERED SEX OFFENDER. When he was 19 he got convicted of statutory rape of a 15 year old. 
After this I just sat there shaking and crying for a good 30 minutes. I always thought the most evil man I've dated was the one who beat the crap out of me for years sexually abused me and almost killed me, but no, this tops that. Since my abuser never hurt our child. 
So now I'm just sitting here alone at work in a state of absolute shock. ","This Was Not on My 2024 Bingo Card. Fr Tho Just Now Getting Over My Panic Attack. So I dated this guy in 2022, shortly before I got with my now partner (I actually chose him over my partner. I met them at the same time)

18284,19aok3e,post,I had a boyfriend who might have been a pedophile,"It took me years to even verbalize that this happened. It disturbs me to this day, and I need to talk about it. 

If anyone else has a story similar to mine I would appreciate any advice or hearing your story too. 

I had a boyfriend a couple years ago who showed signs of being a pedophile or at least finding children attractive.

One of the signs was that we were having sex. (Obviously I’ll spare you any excessive details) He requested to me that I play as younger than my age.

“18?” I asked. 

“Younger.” He responded. 

“17?” 

“Younger.” He said 

“16?” 

“Younger”

“15?”

“Younger.”

“14”

“Younger” he said.

I told him I wasn’t comfortable with his request to keep going younger and younger. I don’t know why and I’m embarrassed to this day, but I agreed to play a 16 year old.

 I think what happened was that I couldn’t quite connect the dots that there is a difference between kink, and pedophilia, and there are lines that should just not be crossed.

I also think that I couldn’t connect that the person I was dating was doing something very wrong.
 
This was also the reason that I didn’t talk about what happened for so many years. I saw the red flag, participated in the red flag and didn’t challenge anything, and I fully own that it was truly unacceptable.

He wasn’t happy with the performance and the session ended. 

Another sign was that he asked to go through my family albums. I really wasn’t comfortable due to the fact that I was really insecure as a kid. I didn’t really like my hair or my teeth and so I just honestly prefer not to look at through stuff like that.  

He kept requesting and requesting. Finally I obliged. He came over and as we were flipping through we found an 8 mini set picture of me in a ballet costume. He asked if he could cut off the picture to take home. The picture he requested was me at 8 years old, possibly 9.

I don’t know why I said yes. As soon as he had the picture he said he needed to leave. As we were walking out he said to me
“Oh my gosh wouldn’t it be funny if someone called me a pedophile because I had this?”

How that slipped past my mind, and it didn’t tell me that what he was requesting was inappropriate, I don’t know. I regret letting him have that picture. He kept it displayed on his dresser, and when I finally got out of that relationship I realized I should have never handed it over to him. Who knows what dark corner of the internet it ended up on or who he shared that with. Hopefully that’s not the case, and I hope he threw it away when we split ways. 

There were other signs that he had like wanting to go on outings where mostly kids were present. We didn’t have kids and he’d want to go on dates that were typically marketed to families and younger children. 

 He became erect after beating his younger family members in a video game. It was instantaneous, and I was uncomfortable.

I don’t think the children saw anything due to running out of the room thank goodness, but I did. 

There was so much that slipped past me. I told myself that I’d never let it happen again. I have now educated myself on what child abusers look for, and how to be repellent to them. 

There were also many more events that happened, but these were the major ones. 

There were a lot of boundary violations that he did. I thought so much of what happened was normal, and that in itself was a hurdle to get over, but this aspect of that relationship haunts me the most. I’d give anything to ensure that he never gets his hands on a child to hurt.

I pray he gets help if the signs were accurate, before something terrible happens. I have heard of pedophiles living normal lives while never offending and I hope that is the case for him.  Some people say it’s slim, and certain testimonials are questionable, but I’m going to hope for any child’s sake that it’s the case.","I had a boyfriend who might have been a pedophile It took me years to even verbalize that this happened.

18285,1990hgj,post,OUR SOCIETY STILL CONSIDER WIDOW AS SLAVE,"I know this may have offended you, but after reading my post, you'll understand why I used such harsh words. I am not from the USA, so please ignore if my English is not up to mark. Also this story will be in two parts because of it’s length  
  
And second, it's a phase of my life with many incidents, so imagine how big it can be, so only read when free and have sufficient time. (It's a must-read, so if you are busy, save it for later )  
  
Let's begin with one of my life's best and worst phases.  
  
It was after my graduation I got my 1st job. I was thrilled as I was one among the only eight students selected for the job. I was chosen as a level 1 manager, which was quite good then and got a very good house in an excellent locality.  
  
And here comes the leading lady whom I want to talk about. Her name was Avni(name changed) and she was absolutely stunning anyone could be attracted by her . Though she was in her 30s, she looked like a recently married woman. But the strangest part was that one of my friends (I met there), Sal(change), told me that she was a widow as her husband died three years ago in an accident.  
  
I noted one strange thing no o:ne used to talk a lot with her as if she was from another world. One lucky day while I was going to my office I saw her with her son in her way to school. So I thought I would give a lift to the school as she was waiting for a cab. So after a lot of insistence she accepted my request and I drove her to the school. In between I asked Ron(changed) about his studies so he said he was in 4th std. Then Avni said he's very weak in his studies, and her teacher always scolds him . When I asked him about his weak subject it was maths which is my favourite one. So I said that I don't have much stuff to do after office, so will teach him maths but Avni rejected and said no you're new here and I don't want to disturb you. I understood it's not valuable to insist her and dropped her at school.  
  
After that, we often met at the supermarket or the park near our apartment. We had a bit of conversation, mostly about Ron . I ever thought that she is leading a good life without a partner and thought why someone need a partner when can be so happy being single. After a few months she came to me at house for the first time . I was shocked as she haven't came to my house before . I welcomed her in a scary face as she was in a frightened mood ( I thought my friend said something to her ). She came in I asked for tea or coffee which she declined and said I need to talk something very important to you. So I sat front of her and the conversation began:  
  
Avni :- Today was my child's semester repot .  
  
Myself:- ohh! I hope he did well.  
  
Avni:- No the report is miserable . He has scored 69% and in mathematics it's just 25.  
  
Myself:- Ok . That's not too bad you even my scores were like this in my 4th grade.  
  
Avni:- Do you think it's fine . I am sacrificing for him but still he is just coming up with 69% . That's really not I expect . I always do whatever he wants but I just expect studies from him and if he cannot even give me that what is the matter for my so much of sacrifices. I am still living here just because of him or would have vacant the place much earlier.  
  
Myself:- Ohk it's really bad to know this . Is there any possible way I could help you.  
  
Avni :- Yes. I need your help. If you don't mind will you teach maths to Rohit.I don't think her tuition teacher teaches him well.  
  
Myself:- That's all my pleasure . I said you earlier as I am free I will definitely love to teach maths in my free time.  
  
Avni:- Yes but that shouldn't at all effect your work life and personal life.  
  
Myself :- Definitely not it wont take a lot of time besides I don't have a lot to do after work. So from tomorrow I will come from 7 pm .  
  
Avni:- That's fine . But how much will you charge for it?  
  
Myself:- Now you really insulting me . How can I take from my friend and neighbor.  
  
Avni:- No but you'll have to or else don't teach.  
  
Myself:-(knowing her nature) Ohk fine give whatever you think is sufficient.  
  
Avni:- Sure will wait for you tomorrow. Bye you really did a great favor for me.  
  
Myself :- Now that's too much. Please don't make me feel ashamed.  
  
And she smilingly left.  
  
Then I used to daily teach her son and he was really able to cope up things easily than I thought. I didn't understand how he failed and that's what I said Avni he is really very intelligent. She felt very happy after hearing this. He also proved by scoring 8/10 in his formative exam. This became our daily routine . I used to always come from office and then go to tutor Ron and was always was served with snacks and tea. I really loved teaching after a hectic job. After teaching him he used to go to play at 8:00 pm and I used to talk some random things with Avni and then went home. I really liked talking with her. Soon we also developed an emotional connection and started discussing our personal problems . I felt very good after discussing my problems with her as that made me feel very comfortable. We also talked about my ex , my problems with my family. But after knowing her problems I was really shocked . She said after her husband died everything changed in her life. Her relatives don't contact her at all . The neighbors who used to always be very social and helpful now's it seems that she is just alone and abandoned. Her best friend who just lived beside her Renu (name changed) no longer talk to her. And that's just because she is a widow and everyone think that widows are very unlucky and not at all holy in our society.  
  
I was really shocked that even in 21st century people believe in all such things. With these she started crying , I went besides her and gave her comfort and reassurance that not to care such kind of people they are just useless. Then she hugged me in her pain.  
  
I understood it's in her pain and hugged her back for a few minutes.  
  
I don't why but then I kissed her. It was a deep passionate kiss that lasted for about 3-4 mins. started to undress her but then she immediately pushed me back and said to leave the house immediately in an angry tone. I left, still thinking how I screwed things up with her. I knew that I did something very wrong and how could I able to look at her eyes again. It was around 2 am when I receive a message . I knew whose was it. I was just shivering while opening the inbox.  
  
Avni:- Hey? Are u awake?  
  
Me:- Yes , how could I sleep.  
  
Me:- See Avni, I know what happened shouldn't have but believe we everything went on its own . Now I have realized I did something very wrong.  
  
Avni:- It seems you're too worried about that . That's totally fine even I didn't have any idea about what was going on.  
  
Avni:- But now……  
  
Me:- but now…?what?( scared)  
  
Avni:- I have made my mind.  
  
Me:- about what? I know what you want to say , don't worry I will not come from tomorrow if you want I'll teach Ron at my house.  
  
Avni:- no I didn't want to say that.  
  
Me:- So?  
  
Avni:- What are you doing now ?  
  
Me:- Nothing?  
  
Avni:- Can you come to my house now?  
  
Me:- now? It's 12 AM  
  
Avni:- Yaa I know. I need you now  
  
Me:- Sure I'm coming  
  
Avni:- The door is open. Ron is sleeping directly come to my bedroom.  
  
Me:- Ok  
  
I quietly went to her room and to my surprise she was undressed lying on her bed. She said please don't say anything….and just come to me.  
  
It is impossible to control yourself in this kind of situation where you are already attached to the person emotionally and have a deep crush on her. And what a night I had that day there aren't any words to describe her. It was best sex I ever had was an understatement. She had lust like a virgin and was too flexible in bed. She was wet and her moaning made it 10x more fun. We had intercourse three that night(first time in my life). Finally we were exhausted at 3 am and I said ""I should leave now"" so she asked whether I could sleep with her today and I nodded immediately. I said I can't believe I am sleeping with you, my so long crush. I ended up waking in the morning 8 am and rushed to my home. I talked to her that morning about the experience and she said it was amazing. She missed being loved for last few years and I made her feel loved once again. And then we used to have intercourse more frequently and even our bond became more stronger than ever. She knew my complete journey as well I know her life journey and it was no joke what all she went through. Although I found her my soulmate and wanted to spend rest of my life with her. After more than a year being with her, there's no better time to propose her. On her birthday, I proposed her as I was in love with her and promised to love her and Ron (though I think there's anything like love due to my past experiences) but she rejected and said I have already told you I am not at all interested in marriage at all. Though she says it's due to her child but I think someone she too thinks that the society is right and she is like curse , she thinks that if she marry again she'll have to face the same situation .Never mind I made myself clear that I will not think about it again and just enjoy my time with her.  
  
The last part of this:-  
  
Till here everything was going good but Ron had a friend Saad(name changed) much older in age(15–17). He used to often come to her house. As we spend most of the time together one fine day when I had good time with her, then went to my house at 10pm as usual from her house and slept as I was tired .  
  
As it was Sunday and I woke late in this day my friend Sal (name changed) who use to live in the same area called me.  
  
Sal:-hey?  
  
Me:- what happened it's Sunday you know I wake at 11  
  
Sal:- what have you done?  
  
Me:- what do you mean ?(in shocking time)  
  
Sal :- I have sent you something see it?  
  
Me :- what is it say me now?  
  
Sal :- You'll understand everything just see and now.  
  
I hanged the phone. He send me some video . While I was clicking Avni called me . I rejected as thought not so important .  
  
After seeing the video I was blank. It was like I was not getting what to do now?  
  
Questions prevailed in my mind?  
  
Who did? what should I do? Should I leave the city now?  
  
Again a call came from Avni  
  
Avni:- I trusted you as everything , and you gave this in return to me?(in a crying loud tone)  
  
Me:- Wait Avni , I didn't get you?  
  
Avni:- Don't try to be so innocent . You ruined my life  
  
Me:- Please Avni calm down? Should I come to your house and explain everything?  
  
Avni:- Don't dare to.  
  
Me :- Okay but please trust me I have nothing to do with the video ? Just now Sal sent me and I am too as shocked and scared as you are.  
  
Avni:- I don't no but what should I do now. these people will not let me live now.  
  
Me:- No one has that right. You didn't do anything illegal so don't worry.  
  
Avni:- It's very easy for you to say all that.  
  
With this she disconnected the call.  
  
I immediately called Sal  
  
Me:- how the hell you got this video ?( Very angrily)  
  
Sal:- Saad sent me.  
  
Me:- what that spoiled brat  
  
Sal :- yaa  
  
Me :- And whom all did he sent?  
  
Sal :- I guess the whole locality knows about it till now. These things spread quickly.  
  
Me:- Now what can be done ?  
  
Sal :- It's too late now. I have always suggested you to stay away from her but you didn't listen. She just wanted to make someone her prey and u are in her trap?  
  
Me:- What the hell are you talking about? Just keep the phone.  
  
And then it was like like what. I didn't got out of the house the whole day.I don't know how he managed to get the video as I have never recorded her and neither did she. Then at last in evening hunger lead me to face the world.  
  
Everyone gazed as if I am an actor or a wanted criminal. Of that there very many whom I didn't know or have never seen but they were like they know me well. I managed to get out of the area someone very far away from these people . But still was scared that what if someone recognizes me. Then I thought if my situation is like this how will be Avni.  
  
Anyhow days passed as hell and there was nothing happening around . It was like it's the time before storm. And soon very expecting thing happened . Everyone surrounded Avni's house . A lot of people gathered around the house.  
  
I was ready to face any situation right now and went very boldly in front of them.  
  
In short they said her to leave the area within 2 week. And after this she somehow manage to go to her native town and talked to the principal that her son will only be able to come for final exams which he agreed. After this her whole life changed once again. She even have to leave the city where she was living for more than 10 years.  
  
But what after that?  
  
Just when she went there, it was like everything changed back to normal. I too thought that it would be tough to live here for me so applied for transfer but the company said it won't be possible and gave me a time period of 6 months . But just after a month it was like everything become normal. Everyone talked with me the same way as they did before whether it was grocery store ,other locality or park. Now I felt the people had problem with Avni and not for what we did. They got a golden opportunity to throw her away from their area.  
  
So just after 6 months on one Sunday , Renu(her ex friend) came to my home. I didn't know why the hell she's here. And asked angrily her why is she here. She asked for some coffee powder and asked me whether she can come in to which I couldn't deny. And after that what she did was really something shocked . She dropped her palu (part of saree) , I was scared af that she wants me to trap for something I didn't do . And went at a distance from her and said her to stay away from me to which she said don't worry I need your help. I calmed a bit and understood what she want. Then she said what you saw in Avni that's not in me. I watched your video and from then I had imagined about you since then. Try you won't regret. And we ended having short intercourse there .  
  
After a few days we had a brief conversation  
  
Me:- I need to ask you something if you don't mind  
  
Renu:- yes  
  
Me:- While you did the same thing being married so what was the problem with Avni  
  
Renu:- Yes because she is a widow  
  
Me :- So?  
  
Renu:- In our culture widow don't have right to have any fun . They are consider a curse for society.  
  
Myself:- speechless ( I cannot change the people's mentality)  
  
So this was all about the best and worse phase of my life and what I learnt many things from it.  
  
Life is not the same as we were child or in college life where we listen each and every thing our girlfriend says and try to protect women in every possible way.  
  
About our culture: It's really very difficult to understand . I never thought widows are considered so differently as if they are slaves brought by the Arabs from Africa .  
  
I just need to ask you people few questions  
  
Doesn't a widow as rights to have all fun and fulfil their desires.  
  
With this kind of society how far can we go?  
  
Please let me know your views in all these matter.  
","OUR SOCIETY STILL CONSIDER WIDOW AS SLAVE I know this may have offended you, but after reading my post, you'll understand why I used such harsh words. I am not from the USA, so please ignore if my English is not up to mark. Also this story will be in two parts because of it’s length  
  
And second, it's a phase of my life with many incidents, so imagine how big it can be, so only read when free and have sufficient time. (It's a must-read, so if you are busy, save it for later )  
  
Let's begin with one of my life's best and worst phases.  
  
It was after my graduation I got my 1st job. I was thrilled as I was one among the only eight students selected for the job. I was chosen as a level 1 manager, which was quite good then and got a very good house in an excellent locality.  
  
And here comes the leading lady whom I want to talk about. Her name was Avni(name changed) and she was absolutely stunning anyone could be attracted by her . Though she was in her 30s, she looked like a recently married woman. But the strangest part was that one of my friends (I met there), Sal(change), told me that she was a widow as her husband died three years ago in an accident.  
  
I noted one strange thing no o:ne used to talk a lot with her as if she was from another world. One lucky day while I was going to my office I saw her with her son in her way to school. So I thought I would give a lift to the school as she was waiting for a cab. So after a lot of insistence she accepted my request and I drove her to the school. In between I asked Ron(changed) about his studies so he said he was in 4th std. Then Avni said he's very weak in his studies, and her teacher always scolds him . When I asked him about his weak subject it was maths which is my favourite one. So I said that I don't have much stuff to do after office, so will teach him maths but Avni rejected and said no you're new here and I don't want to disturb you. I understood it's not valuable to insist her and dropped her at school.  
  
After that, we often met at the supermarket or the park near our apartment. We had a bit of conversation, mostly about Ron . I ever thought that she is leading a good life without a partner and thought why someone need a partner when can be so happy being single. After a few months she came to me at house for the first time . I was shocked as she haven't came to my house before . I welcomed her in a scary face as she was in a frightened mood ( I thought my friend said something to her ). She came in I asked for tea or coffee which she declined and said I need to talk something very important to you. So I sat front of her and the conversation began:  
  
Avni :- Today was my child's semester repot .  
  
Myself:- ohh! I hope he did well.  
  
Avni:- No the report is miserable . He has scored 69% and in mathematics it's just 25.  
  
Myself:- Ok . That's not too bad you even my scores were like this in my 4th grade.  
  
Avni:- Do you think it's fine . I am sacrificing for him but still he is just coming up with 69% . That's really not I expect . I always do whatever he wants but I just expect studies from him and if he cannot even give me that what is the matter for my so much of sacrifices. I am still living here just because of him or would have vacant the place much earlier.  
  
Myself:- Ohk it's really bad to know this . Is there any possible way I could help you.  
  
Avni :- Yes. I need your help. If you don't mind will you teach maths to Rohit.I don't think her tuition teacher teaches him well.  
  
Myself:- That's all my pleasure . I said you earlier as I am free I will definitely love to teach maths in my free time.  
  
Avni:- Yes but that shouldn't at all effect your work life and personal life.  
  
Myself :- Definitely not it wont take a lot of time besides I don't have a lot to do after work. So from tomorrow I will come from 7 pm .  
  
Avni:- That's fine . But how much will you charge for it?  
  
Myself:- Now you really insulting me . How can I take from my friend and neighbor.  
  
Avni:- No but you'll have to or else don't teach.  
  
Myself:-(knowing her nature) Ohk fine give whatever you think is sufficient.  
  
Avni:- Sure will wait for you tomorrow. Bye you really did a great favor for me.  
  
Myself :- Now that's too much. Please don't make me feel ashamed.  
  
And she smilingly left.  
  
Then I used to daily teach her son and he was really able to cope up things easily than I thought. I didn't understand how he failed and that's what I said Avni he is really very intelligent. She felt very happy after hearing this. He also proved by scoring 8/10 in his formative exam. This became our daily routine . I used to always come from office and then go to tutor Ron and was always was served with snacks and tea. I really loved teaching after a hectic job. After teaching him he used to go to play at 8:00 pm and I used to talk some random things with Avni and then went home. I really liked talking with her. Soon we also developed an emotional connection and started discussing our personal problems . I felt very good after discussing my problems with her as that made me feel very comfortable. We also talked about my ex , my problems with my family. But after knowing her problems I was really shocked . She said after her husband died everything changed in her life. Her relatives don't contact her at all . The neighbors who used to always be very social and helpful now's it seems that she is just alone and abandoned. Her best friend who just lived beside her Renu (name changed) no longer talk to her. And that's just because she is a widow and everyone think that widows are very unlucky and not at all holy in our society.  
  
I was really shocked that even in 21st century people believe in all such things. With these she started crying , I went besides her and gave her comfort and reassurance that not to care such kind of people they are just useless. Then she hugged me in her pain.  
  
I understood it's in her pain and hugged her back for a few minutes.  
  
I don't why but then I kissed her. It was a deep passionate kiss that lasted for about 3-4 mins. started to undress her but then she immediately pushed me back and said to leave the house immediately in an angry tone. I left, still thinking how I screwed things up with her. I knew that I did something very wrong and how could I able to look at her eyes again. It was around 2 am when I receive a message . I knew whose was it. I was just shivering while opening the inbox.  
  
Avni:- Hey? Are u awake?  
  
Me:- Yes , how could I sleep.  
  
Me:- See Avni, I know what happened shouldn't have but believe we everything went on its own . Now I have realized I did something very wrong.  
  
Avni:- It seems you're too worried about that . That's totally fine even I didn't have any idea about what was going on.  
  
Avni:- But now……  
  
Me:- but now…?what?( scared)  
  
Avni:- I have made my mind.  
  
Me:- about what? I know what you want to say , don't worry I will not come from tomorrow if you want I'll teach Ron at my house.  
  
Avni:- no I didn't want to say that.  
  
Me:- So?  
  
Avni:- What are you doing now ?  
  
Me:- Nothing?  
  
Avni:- Can you come to my house now?  
  
Me:- now? It's 12 AM  
  
Avni:- Yaa I know. I need you now  
  
Me:- Sure I'm coming  
  
Avni:- The door is open. Ron is sleeping directly come to my bedroom.  
  
Me:- Ok  
  
I quietly went to her room and to my surprise she was undressed lying on her bed. She said please don't say anything….and just come to me.  
  
It is impossible to control yourself in this kind of situation where you are already attached to the person emotionally and have a deep crush on her. And what a night I had that day there aren't any words to describe her. It was best sex I ever had was an understatement. She had lust like a virgin and was too flexible in bed. She was wet and her moaning made it 10x more fun. We had intercourse three that night(first time in my life). Finally we were exhausted at 3 am and I said ""I should leave now"" so she asked whether I could sleep with her today and I nodded immediately. I said I can't believe I am sleeping with you, my so long crush. I ended up waking in the morning 8 am and rushed to my home. I talked to her that morning about the experience and she said it was amazing. She missed being loved for last few years and I made her feel loved once again. And then we used to have intercourse more frequently and even our bond became more stronger than ever. She knew my complete journey as well I know her life journey and it was no joke what all she went through. Although I found her my soulmate and wanted to spend rest of my life with her. After more than a year being with her, there's no better time to propose her. On her birthday, I proposed her as I was in love with her and promised to love her and Ron (though I think there's anything like love due to my past experiences) but she rejected and said I have already told you I am not at all interested in marriage at all. Though she says it's due to her child but I think someone she too thinks that the society is right and she is like curse , she thinks that if she marry again she'll have to face the same situation .Never mind I made myself clear that I will not think about it again and just enjoy my time with her.  
  
The last part of this:-  
  
Till here everything was going good but Ron had a friend Saad(name changed) much older in age(15–17). He used to often come to her house. As we spend most of the time together one fine day when I had good time with her, then went to my house at 10pm as usual from her house and slept as I was tired .  
  
As it was Sunday and I woke late in this day my friend Sal (name changed) who use to live in the same area called me.  
  
Sal:-hey?  
  
Me:- what happened it's Sunday you know I wake at 11  
  
Sal:- what have you done?  
  
Me:- what do you mean ?(in shocking time)  
  
Sal :- I have sent you something see it?  
  
Me :- what is it say me now?  
  
Sal :- You'll understand everything just see and now.  
  
I hanged the phone. He send me some video . While I was clicking Avni called me . I rejected as thought not so important .  
  
After seeing the video I was blank. It was like I was not getting what to do now?  
  
Questions prevailed in my mind?  
  
Who did? what should I do? Should I leave the city now?  
  
Again a call came from Avni  
  
Avni:- I trusted you as everything , and you gave this in return to me?(in a crying loud tone)  
  
Me:- Wait Avni , I didn't get you?  
  
Avni:- Don't try to be so innocent . You ruined my life  
  
Me:- Please Avni calm down? Should I come to your house and explain everything?  
  
Avni:- Don't dare to.  
  
Me :- Okay but please trust me I have nothing to do with the video ? Just now Sal sent me and I am too as shocked and scared as you are.  
  
Avni:- I don't no but what should I do now. these people will not let me live now.  
  
Me:- No one has that right. You didn't do anything illegal so don't worry.  
  
Avni:- It's very easy for you to say all that.  
  
With this she disconnected the call.  
  
I immediately called Sal  
  
Me:- how the hell you got this video ?( Very angrily)  
  
Sal:- Saad sent me.  
  
Me:- what that spoiled brat  
  
Sal :- yaa  
  
Me :- And whom all did he sent?  
  
Sal :- I guess the whole locality knows about it till now. These things spread quickly.  
  
Me:- Now what can be done ?  
  
Sal :- It's too late now. I have always suggested you to stay away from her but you didn't listen. She just wanted to make someone her prey and u are in her trap?  
  
Me:- What the hell are you talking about? Just keep the phone.  
  
And then it was like like what. I didn't got out of the house the whole day.I don't know how he managed to get the video as I have never recorded her and neither did she. Then at last in evening hunger lead me to face the world.  
  
Everyone gazed as if I am an actor or a wanted criminal. Of that there very many whom I didn't know or have never seen but they were like they know me well. I managed to get out of the area someone very far away from these people . But still was scared that what if someone recognizes me. Then I thought if my situation is like this how will be Avni.  
  
Anyhow days passed as hell and there was nothing happening around . It was like it's the time before storm. And soon very expecting thing happened . Everyone surrounded Avni's house . A lot of people gathered around the house.  
  
I was ready to face any situation right now and went very boldly in front of them.  
  
In short they said her to leave the area within 2 week. And after this she somehow manage to go to her native town and talked to the principal that her son will only be able to come for final exams which he agreed. After this her whole life changed once again. She even have to leave the city where she was living for more than 10 years.  
  
But what after that?  
  
Just when she went there, it was like everything changed back to normal. I too thought that it would be tough to live here for me so applied for transfer but the company said it won't be possible and gave me a time period of 6 months . But just after a month it was like everything become normal. Everyone talked with me the same way as they did before whether it was grocery store ,other locality or park. Now I felt the people had problem with Avni and not for what we did. They got a golden opportunity to throw her away from their area.  
  
So just after 6 months on one Sunday , Renu(her ex friend) came to my home. I didn't know why the hell she's here. And asked angrily her why is she here. She asked for some coffee powder and asked me whether she can come in to which I couldn't deny. And after that what she did was really something shocked . She dropped her palu (part of saree) , I was scared af that she wants me to trap for something I didn't do . And went at a distance from her and said her to stay away from me to which she said don't worry I need your help. I calmed a bit and understood what she want. Then she said what you saw in Avni that's not in me. I watched your video and from then I had imagined about you since then. Try you won't regret. And we ended having short intercourse there .  
  
After a few days we had a brief conversation  
  
Me:- I need to ask you something if you don't mind  
  
Renu:- yes  
  
Me:- While you did the same thing being married so what was the problem with Avni  
  
Renu:- Yes because she is a widow  
  
Me :- So?  
  
Renu:- In our culture widow don't have right to have any fun . They are consider a curse for society.  
  
Myself:- speechless ( I cannot change the people's mentality)  
  
So this was all about the best and worse phase of my life and what I learnt many things from it.  
  
Life is not the same as we were child or in college life where we listen each and every thing our girlfriend says and try to protect women in every possible way.  
  
About our culture: It's really very difficult to understand . I never thought widows are considered so differently as if they are slaves brought by the Arabs from Africa .  
  
I just need to ask you people few questions

With this kind of society how far can we go?

18286,18x83fv,post,"At 14, my girlfriend was tortured for dating me and I blamed myself for 8 years. I've tried to forget her but can't. I need help.","When I (22M) was 14 I dated 2 sisters at the same time. Kitten, 16 years old, and Turtle, 15 years old. They were both aware and consented to the arrangement btw. 

Kitten was the love of my life. It feels wrong to say because we were so young. But you know you love somebody when after 8 years of not speaking, you still can't forget them. God knows I've tried. 

As the title states, she was tortured for dating me. Her father was literally crazy, manipulative, and a sex offender. He's currently sitting behind bars for violating the restrictions placed on him. Fleeing California, changing his and his wife's name, and pretty much going on the run. They were so thorough in their deception that Kitten didn't even know her real last name until police swatted their house in the dead of night and arrested her parents. The girl had an entire family she had never heard of. Not even stories. Her whole life was a lie. She was 16 and now was taking care of 3 under age siblings in a place she's never been with people she never met. This all happened after we broke up in late 2016-17.

We started dating shortly after school began, 2015. From what she told me, the second she walked in the room and saw me, she had to leave and compose herself. It was love at first site on her end. It took a little bit longer for me. We shared a love for movies, super powers, and sharing our dreams. She had the voice of an angel, and had it not been for her circumstances, I'm sure she would have made a name for herself in the music world.  

Words cannot express how much I love this girl. She treated me in a way no one had ever treated me then or has treated me since. There was just a genuine love in her. She was always a caring person. Extremely loyal, a real ride or die. She saw something in me I wouldn't come to see till much later, still looking for in some ways. 

We only dated for 2-3 months before she gave me the call. She wanted to break up. Gave the usual we have a lot of maturing to do, which was true. But ultimately she was just in a lot of pain. She would come to school with bruises from her father throwing her into a dresser. Kitten was a very small girl. Hardly 5 feet. Give an inch or two. Her parents were polygynous and one the girlfriends they let in the house molested her when she was a child and she was having night terrors. Her Dad's friends would try to pinch her butt. A child. The additional abuse by dating me was too much. 

I don't want to make this too long because I really need people to talk to about it. The one thing I promised her I would do is protect her. I was this 6 foot teenage giant. I worked with my dad and uncle building houses after school. I was tough. What man would I be if I couldn't protect this little girl? But I couldn't. I was so blind. I had never heard of abusive parents before. I didn't know what molestation meant. There were so many signs I couldn't see. I was powerless. I was a child. I haven't gotten over it. I felt like it was my fault for years. There was nothing I could do to repay her.

After the whole swat ordeal and her parents were arrested, she pretty much fell off the face of the earth. I honestly thought she died or committed suicide. I haven't been able to get in contact with her directly. She even went as far as changing her name. 

Jump to the present and the only link to her is her sister, Turtle. I rekindled a relationship with her last year which quickly fell apart. She only liked me because her sister liked me. When we rekindled 2 years ago, Kitten had cut off all ties with her family. They hadn't heard from her in months. But now I see on Turtles Instagram that Kitten is spending the new years with her family. But now Turtle won't pick up my calls or respond to my text. I fear she's ghosting me because we didn't seperate on good terms and this is her way of getting back at me. She knows I want to speak with Sena, I made that very clear years go. She's just a call away. But I have no way of getting in contact with her. 

All I want is closure. I've had my fair share of flings these last 8 years. But through it all, she persist. I just need to say to her everything I didn't know to say to her back then. That I'm sorry I didn't understand. How insensitive I was. How ignorant. I want to tell her that I love her. That I'm sorry I couldn't protect her. I just want to make sure she's okay. She's been through so much. Kitten is one of the best people I've met on this planet. It pains me to see such a wonderful soul be put through so much.

tl;dr - I was in a polygynous relationship at 14, with sisters, 15 and 16. Their dad was crazy, a sex offender, and tortured the older one for not breaking up with me when her father didn't approve. I felt like it was my fault for years because I couldn't protect her. She then fell off the face of the earth. I want to talk to her again and apologize and get closure but her sister won't return my calls or text. 

I have so much more to say but I really need help with this. I need closure. Please help me not feel crazy, desperate, clingy. Help me understand what I'm going through. Please ask questions if you have any.

i’m really confused so please anybody if please can look at this with a fresh point of view and let me know something anything that would be great bc im losing my mind over it. im desperate 

i’m 24 (f) my best friend is 26 (m) 
we’ve been friends for 2 years and in those two years we’ve gotten extremely close to the point that we hang out almost every day. 
our friendship started off as a drunken night
 we were had only spoken to eachother in work place previously. 

I was at the club with some of my friends and he spotted me in the crowd so i walked over to say hi. for the rest of the night i was between both crowd of my friends and him with his. eventually the night ended and me and him made plans to smoke at his place after the club. once we were there ofc naturally we smoked and the conversation of hooking up was brought up. i always thought he was attractive and he admitted to find me attractive as well but was unsure about the idea bc we worked together. nonetheless we kissed.. we had sex for the first time. ever since then we’ve been pretty much inseparable. although that first meeting we decided to not catch feelings as we weren’t eachothers typical type. i was the first to actually say “ hey let’s not fall for eachother and keep it causal “ in fear that i didn’t wanna look so clingy 
it started off as hooking up very casually here and there then it lead to hanging out without sex sometimes. 

i’ve moved into the city about 8 months ago and i happen to live around the corner from him bc my job is also next to him which he no longer works at 
nowadays we spend almost everyday together 

i bring ingredients to his place just to cook dinner together so we can together as well. every holiday that comes around we do movie days count down where we watch a related movie to the season, i’ll lay on him and recently we completely intertwine our bodies to be closer literally we cuddle. i rub his hair and tickle his arms with my nails bc he asks me to. sometimes we also  takes naps together.  

we text everyday from morning till one of us sleeps and not only text but calls for over an hour we talk on all platforms at the same time. we could be having 3 different conversations on 3 apps simultaneously. 
he’s been the one to watch my pet when i’m away to see my family 
he will come pick me up sometimes when i need a ride and we will go out to eat just the two of us but we never call it a date. 
he will play hit me (not painful just playful) and tease me and it always just feels like a non sexual excuse to touch me. don’t get me wrong he does it in a sexual way too. 

when i talk about cute guys he gets jealous i think bc he tells me he doesn’t care or that they look “mid” sometimes he will even say doesn’t he look like me? he will do the same with me and talk about pretty girls and show me pictures when i tell him to pursue he shakes it off and says eh too much work 

i’ve met his brothers and been the only invite to go out with them out of our mutual friend group. i’ve been to their birthdays unlike any of his friends here im the only girl he invites 

on his birthday he was really drunk. he told me “ i feel like i like you because when you’re not here i notice, almost like i miss you. it’s weird because we get along so well in every sense but i just don’t get overprotective like i have in the past with other woman. “ i told him “well if we’re both 40 and single let’s just marry eachother at least we know we would get along”. till this day i don’t think he remembers this conversation nor have i ever brought it up again
he jokes about marrying me and says don’t you wish in love with you?
we’ve never really fought and if we have it only lasts 15 min he ways immediately say sorry if it is on him and vice versa… i feel like i found my soulmate 

here’s the kicker tho on why im unsure if he feels the same. 

he will tell me he’s not into causal sex and when i pull away saying maybe we shouldn’t he gets quiet.  then i’ll say can we just once more and his response is yeah idc you’re the one who wanted to stop. i told him i would only want to if it’s mutual ofc and he said there’s a possibility. (so mysterious for no reason 🥲) he always throws it back onto me never  revealing how he feels 
we tell eachother we’re not eachothers type but honestly i usually start and in fear that i seem like i like him (ik i feel like the queen of self sabotage and self rejection) we both tell eachother it would never happen but i can’t shake the feeling he’s saying it  for the same reason i am. i told him sometimes i don’t like that he says things like pertaining to my ethic background. he said i do it to him all the time  but that’s just always been over joke since i frequently do it too about his ( he’s white im indian ) and under no circumstances is it ever like racist it’s just terms like “i wouldn’t date an indi girl /white guy ) i only say it bc im scared in my past the of men just simply never picked me and made fun of me for being brown. he’s only ever been with white woman sexually and in terms of dating. when i told him i know he would never visit india he was offended saying it would be a once in a lifetime experience and he’d take any opportunity to go   

i just don’t understand these mixed signals 

i’m going to speak as if i was speaking to him now

dear you,
___ if you happen to ever see this. yes i’ve fallen completely head over heels for you. you are my comfort when i close my eyes to go to bed i think of you and deeply visualize the feeling of laying on your chest being held by you. i think about holding your hand. i think about kissing you with passion and not just a part of sex but rather in a way of love. you are my happy place. you come in my dreams and i wake up wishing it was true, trying to close my eyes to remain in that paradise . do you ever feel the same way? do you think we can have a happy ending? i think about you being apart of my family and how you would mesh in the cultural differences, whether your family would enjoy being mixed into mine. i think about wedding traditions and how you’d look on ethnic clothing and if you’d partake in all my traditions as i’m already very familiar with yours and happily would be part of it. 

please
say you feel the same 
say you fell for me 
tell me 
how could you not feel the same 
could you not feel what is happening between us  
our sex is great 
our conversation 
we talk for hours 
we could laugh for hours 
we sit with eachother days at a time 
we could be in silence and still enjoy eachothers company 
my touch for you is different can you feel that? 
i know i make you feel something
please tell me im not crazy  
 i love you and i am scared to tell you. because first and foremost you are my best friend 
one way or the other i need you in this lifetime until we become old and wrinkled

I’m giving up everything for them and my mom still sides against me every time I get into a disagreement with them.

That they want me around. That I matter. It seems like everyone only have words for me when I fuck up. That’s it. 

Before you ask, I am qualified to take care of my brothers. I’m a social worker. Please don’t reach out to services on my behalf. I’m not going to hurt anyone. I’m not going to kill myself. I just needed to get this off my chest.

18290,188tr8r,post,Tinder date says using condoms is a dealbreaker and shames me for disagreeing,"Apologies in advance if what I’m about to say gets too explicit.
I’m just so angry and really need to rant.

TLTR:
Guy says using condoms is a dealbreaker, and then shames me for refusing to have anything to do with him.

And now the long rant version:

First date with a guy I met on Tinder.
We started talking about safe sex.
He said that using condoms was a dealbreaker for him, because he couldn’t feel anything with a condom.
So I said that’s my dealbreaker too so bye.
He insisted on telling me that I was selfish, because I’m placing my pleasure ahead of his. “I don’t ask you to play with your clit through a condom. Why do you get to ask me to use a condom”

Earlier he told me he was casually seeing a few other girls and having sex with them, simultaneously.
So I asked him about the risks of STD and pregnancy.
And here’s his answer:
I take some Indian herbs so I never get any girl pregnant.
As for STD, I’m a man. My body is a closed system. I’m at a much lower risk than women. And I can find women who’s willing to have raw sex, so why should I ever be asked to have sex with condom?
Oh the risk for the women you mean? Well they make an educated guess that it’s safe to have raw sex with me. Also I already go out of my way to make them feel comfortable, I WASH MY HANDS FOR GODS SAKE, I DO IT FOR THEM!!!!


I explained that in my world, the people I interact with, it’s expected to have protected sex. And in fact, if I raised my hand and said I didn’t want condoms, they wouldn’t have sec with me and would probably kick me out of the circle. (Im polyamorous and into swinging)
He first got offended that I would have the audacity to call sex with condom “safe sex”. He insisted that what he did was very safe, just with calculated risks. “You could die from parasites, why do you still eat food?”
As for my standards and hopefully most people’s standards, “the guys using condoms are just doing it for the mental stimulation. They are not men”

I was in fact shocked that someone like him would end up having any dates or sexual partners. But it looks like he’s got a lot. So I asked him whether most girls are ok with his approach. He told me 70-80% of them are.

I live in a conservative city in a very conservative country. And sex education is practically nonexistent.


I’m so angry that someone like this exists and still getting countless dates.
I wish I could say he was lying about most girls being ok with it, and he gets no dates. But I know that’s not true. He is physically attractive and has a successful. In the country I live in, he would actually get a lot of girls and get his way.
Im so angry at him, at the girls for enabling him, and at the fact that this is the country I live in.

Im also grateful that I’ve met enough decent people and I’ve grown enough to see through his bullshit. Ten years ago I could have been one of girls. Ten year ago he could have successfully got into my head and convinced me I was the selfish one. I wish I could yell some senses into his dates, but I feel so helpless that I can’t do anything to help them or stop someone like him","Tinder date says using condoms is a dealbreaker and shames me for disagreeing Apologies in advance if what I’m about to say gets too explicit.

18291,183gzm0,post,I feel pathetic,"I am seriously struggling so much right now, I just need to rant. I have been struggling with many chronic health issues; anxiety, depression, endometriosis and Hashimoto’s disease. Due to my complex health issues, I miss work more often than I like, but I always make sure that I get my job done in time, so that nobody has to pick up my slack. Unfortunately, I have been feeling extremely discriminated against, both at home and in the office.

My housemate have been extremely rude and toxic. She’d make snide remarks like she can’t believe I haven’t been fired, given the amount of sick leaves I take. She also can’t believe that I was actually offered a good job with an above average salary. I’m not a confrontational person, but after contemplating for awhile, I decided to speak to her and let her know how hurtful it is. Instead of acknowledging her mistake, she doubled down and said ‘but people do get fired for that’. Like I’m not an idiot, she did not have to point out the obvious, and I’ve told her many times that I’m so grateful for my understanding and supportive boss. She wants to do a masters in social work, but judging from the problematic shit she says, I didn’t think sw might be the right fit for her. She had already gone through a speech pathology masters, only to give up before the last semester, so I genuinely did not want her to end up wasting her time again. Apart from her snide remarks towards me, she’d say shit like ‘shouldn’t he be happy if all of us girls raped him (her crush)?’ And ‘I’m glad I dodged a bullet since he has erectile dysfunction.’ Or when she mentioned her male 8-10 y.o kids (she works in after school care) discusses about sex positions and it made the girls uncomfortable. I asked her if she had addressed the issue with the boys and she said it’s ‘not her problem, it’s the teacher’s and parent’s problem. Besides, she has more important things to deal with’. 

Like seriously, should a person like this be working with the vulnerable community? I thought to myself, I’d appreciate if a friend was honest with me if they think I wouldn’t be suitable for a particular field. Like sure, I’d be hurt, but I’d appreciate the honesty? But she obviously took it the wrong way and was deeply offended. So I apologised that she got offended and that I should’ve kept the thought to myself. But then she goes on to say I need to ‘not let my intrusive thoughts get to me all the time’ like wtf? Then proceeds to tell me that I am mentally unstable, have borderline personality disorder, and that she feels bad that my parents have to deal with me. 

I went off at her because what kind of friend would say such shit with the intention to hurt me? It really affected my mental health, which as a result triggered my physica symptoms so I wasn’t able to go to work.


And this is when the mean colleague comes into the picture. It’s a new dept so apart from my manager, we’re all fairly new. (I just started 1 month ago and she started 6 months ago) prior to being hired, I was very upfront about my health issues and the company deemed that I was suitable for the job nonetheless. My health have been causing me a lot of stress and the issue with the housemate made things worst. Like I said, nonetheless, I still get my job done on time and she never had to pick up my slack. Unfortunately she decided that idk I’m not deserving of the role or something and refused to communicate about projects we work on tgt. Since she has more experience, I’d sometimes ask her questions and she told me to go look it up on the company website. Like why would I ask if the answer is on the company’s site right? We’re meant to prepare a weekly newsletter with updated events together, but she literally gatekeeps the content and only advertise her own programs? The icing to the cake is, she doesn’t even bother to show me the draft, but instead shows a different colleague who has nothing to do with the newsletter. I can’t help but feel like she doesn’t trust my English standard? (I’m from Singapore, currently living in aus. English is my first language and I went to uni in aus.)

I seriously feel so disrespected and pathetic. I keep wondering if it could be a me problem, but it seems like if that’s the case, then my health issues are probably the root cause - which is just discrimination? I work hard to be employable and I work hard in my job. I have a great relationship with my other housemate and colleagues, so I don’t think it has got to do with my attitude/ personality right?

Sigh, I just feel so pathetic that’s all. If you have gotten to this point, thank you for reading my rant. I really appreciate it. (Also, typed this on mobile, so might be messy) 💕","I feel pathetic I am seriously struggling so much right now, I just need to rant. I have been struggling with many chronic health issues; anxiety, depression, endometriosis and Hashimoto’s disease. Due to my complex health issues, I miss work more often than I like, but I always make sure that I get my job done in time, so that nobody has to pick up my slack. Unfortunately, I have been feeling extremely discriminated against, both at home and in the office.

My housemate have been extremely rude and toxic. She’d make snide remarks like she can’t believe I haven’t been fired, given the amount of sick leaves I take. She also can’t believe that I was actually offered a good job with an above average salary. I’m not a confrontational person, but after contemplating for awhile, I decided to speak to her and let her know how hurtful it is. Instead of acknowledging her mistake, she doubled down and said ‘but people do get fired for that’. Like I’m not an idiot, she did not have to point out the obvious, and I’ve told her many times that I’m so grateful for my understanding and supportive boss. She wants to do a masters in social work, but judging from the problematic shit she says, I didn’t think sw might be the right fit for her. She had already gone through a speech pathology masters, only to give up before the last semester, so I genuinely did not want her to end up wasting her time again. Apart from her snide remarks towards me, she’d say shit like ‘shouldn’t he be happy if all of us girls raped him (her crush)?’ And ‘I’m glad I dodged a bullet since he has erectile dysfunction.’ Or when she mentioned her male 8-10 y.o kids (she works in after school care) discusses about sex positions and it made the girls uncomfortable. I asked her if she had addressed the issue with the boys and she said it’s ‘not her problem, it’s the teacher’s and parent’s problem. Besides, she has more important things to deal with’. 

Like seriously, should a person like this be working with the vulnerable community? I thought to myself, I’d appreciate if a friend was honest with me if they think I wouldn’t be suitable for a particular field. Like sure, I’d be hurt, but I’d appreciate the honesty? But she obviously took it the wrong way and was deeply offended. So I apologised that she got offended and that I should’ve kept the thought to myself. But then she goes on to say I need to ‘not let my intrusive thoughts get to me all the time’ like wtf? Then proceeds to tell me that I am mentally unstable, have borderline personality disorder, and that she feels bad that my parents have to deal with me. 

I went off at her because what kind of friend would say such shit with the intention to hurt me? It really affected my mental health, which as a result triggered my physica symptoms so I wasn’t able to go to work.

18294,17w10ug,post,Legacy of a Child Prostitute: Reflecting on Generational Trauma,"CW --->>> This post contains stories of pedophilia, child prostitution and more.

My dad recently came out of the closet, just before his 77th birthday. I can’t say I’m entirely surprised; I mean, I found the gay porn he had hidden away in his bedroom when I was still just a boy.

But I’ve been learning a lot more about his life than I could have imagined. As I explore my dad’s story with him, coaching him through the process of writing a tell all memoir, I find my own life experiences make more sense.My father is a far left liberal baby boomer born shortly after his father returned home from WWII. He was raised in a traditionally conservative southern home, and suffered from middle child syndrome; feeling isolated from family. His older brother, having been born before the war, was 7 years older than my father, and my dad was 6 years old before the rest of his siblings were born.

It was during that period, while his mother was struggling with another baby in the home, that my dad first started going to work with his father in order to get out from under his mother’s feet. My grandfather was a butcher at a small local grocer, and rather than hanging around my grandfather, with his bone saws and butcher knives, my dad helped stock shelves; working with Mister Bill, the store owner. Mr Bill was a pedophile, who got to know my dad personally during that time, and eventually established an ongoing abusive relationship with my dad. He groomed my father, and the two of them spent weekends together so that my grandparents could focus on taking care of the smaller children in the home (my father's younger siblings). Mr Bill had a family of his own, but his wife and kids often traveled leaving my father alone with Mr Bill, who would join my father in bed taking advantage of the small child my father was at the time.

Now there is a cognitive dissonance my father struggles with as he reflects back on that period of his life, and it’s fascinating. As a loving father himself, my dad is rightfully disgusted by pedophilia, and yet he speaks affectionately about Mr Bill; talking lovingly about their ‘relationship’ and how Mr Bill made him feel good physically, emotionally and relationally. I think my dad is still resentful of his mother who struggled to care for him and his siblings, and he was never close with his father. Mr Bill was the first and most important adult influence in my father’s young life. I will not be surprised to discover how Mr Bill amplified the dissatisfaction my father experienced at home, as he continues to develop his memoir.

With this knowledge, I now understand why my father was emotionally distant when my sister and I were younger; he’s never had an intimate friendship that wasn’t in some way sexual, and didn’t know how to connect with us, so he remained distant as he sought to cope with his undiagnosed ADHD by disassociating from the difficulties we faced as a family.

By the time my father was 13 years old he’d become a child prostitute, turning tricks at local movie theatres on the weekends while living with his aunt Pearl, and acting as a care giver for his own ailing grandfather. The skills he picked up seducing men to pay him for sexual encounters led to an affair during the summer break at the end of his freshman year in high school. During an extended tour of the east coast with his school chorus, my father enticed the middle aged bus driver to initiate the affair. The bus driver had a son on that same field trip who was a high school senior, and I don’t know that he ever found out that his father had been sleeping with a freshman on that field trip.

My dad joined the navy during the Vietnam War in order to avoid being drafted into the army, and turned down a promising career after a general offered to give him his selection of appointments to the European embassy of his choice. Even though my father had married his first wife by this point in his life, he was terrified of being discovered as a homosexual because he’d seen what happened to fellow recruits and officers who had been outed. My dad had taken to venturing off base to seek one night stands with different men, and wasn’t prepared to walk away from that aspect of his life. He had been groomed to associate those encounters with love and tender affection.

That first marriage only ended because my father introduced another man into the relationship, and they started a ménage à trois. Eventually my father became the third wheel in the relationship. While the two of them are still married to this day, my father had to walk away.

After that part of his life came to an abrupt end, my dad, 31 at the time, met Mike, a 21 year old who was in the process of being evicted from the penthouse suit he’d been living in since he was 14 years old. One of the Chrysler’s had bought Mike from Mike’s own father; taking him out of school, and hiding him away in that penthouse suit where he could be sexually abused by Mr Chrysler whenever the fancy struck. At 21 years of age, he’d become to old for Mr. Chrysler; hence the eviction.

The two men (my father and Mike) immediately entered into a sexual partnership, relating intimately with each other. That relationship would be on again off again for years that extended beyond my mother's passing, although they’re now estranged because Mike is a conservative who supports Donald Trump and my father, as the extreme liberal that he is, hates Trump with a deep and burning passion.

Now my parents met in the early 80’s when my dad moved out to Texas, after a second separation from Mike. My mother learned that my father was bisexual, and that he had just come out of a serious relationship with another man before the two of them agreed to get married.

Growing up my family never discussed anything related to sex for reasons that are clearly apparent now that I understand the story behind my parents’ relationship; my father regularly stepping out on my mom to engage in homosexual encounters while we were still very young. My mom eventually presented my father with an ultimatum; he had to remain faithful to her or else she would leave and take the kids. He stayed for us, and their love for each other deepened over the years, though their intimacy was never as sexual as I now believe my mother desired. I distinctly remember an argument between my parents where my mother lamented that my father had never found her attractive, a sentiment that I didn’t fully understand before now.

The fact that the adults in my life never discussed sex with me or my sister left us vulnerable to our own experiences of traumatic abuse that began when I was 5 and continued until we reached an age where we were exposed to sex ed in school. You see, when I was 5 years old I had a neighbour, named Travis, who was a year older, age six. Travis taught me a super secret game. One day when I was playing with him at his house, we were in his bedroom and he asked if I could keep a secret. He locked the door and took off his pants. “You can’t tell anyone.”

In hindsight, it is clear that he was being, or had been, abused by one or more of his mother’s boyfriends. That kind of behaviour is learned, not invented by a 6 year old. That ‘friendship’ ended when I was in the first grade and Travis’ mom moved him out of state, but not before he introduced my sister to that same ‘super secret game.’ I thank God that there were some things my sister and I were both uncomfortable with, and therefore some lines were never crossed, however we both fed into the traumatic abuse for years; the first rule of fight club is that you don’t talk about fight club (In middle school, after taking a beating in a parking lot after class, my ability to keep a secret gained me deep respect from the gang who apparently half expected me to run and report the assault to some adult after the fact).

My freshman year in high school, as the chubby kid in a back brace (I had broken my back in the 8th grade after another beating during PE class where I was targeted because I was the white kid in class) I struggled with the question of my own sexuality. With what I have recently learned about my parents, I now realize why my mother gently expressed concerns that I might be homosexual, but at the time that only added to my confusion. During my freshman year (the age my father was when he’d been a child prostitute) I couldn’t take PE with my spinal injury so the school permitted me to take drama as a substitute. I remember a classmate in my drama class, a lean older boy, who unknowingly encouraged me to question whether my history with Travis meant that I should be homosexual. This was also around the time I discovered my father’s gay porn collection.

Ultimately I avoided intimate relationships altogether because I didn’t know how I was supposed to decide what I wanted. I am now grateful that those struggles resulted in my having no exes; my wife being the first person I connected with in an intimate relationship. My first date, at 23 years of age was with my wife. People say you can’t choose your sexuality; my father insists that he was born gay. In contrast to that ideology I can confidently say that, while I am not attracted to men, there was a time in my youth where I was not as confident as I am now.

Growing up my family also suffered from undiagnosed autism and ADHD. My father didn’t get an official ADHD diagnosis until after he retired (a diagnosis he had forgotten to tell me about), and my mother never received an autism diagnosis. My nephew’s official autism diagnosis, with his high support needs, has provided missing context for the struggles my mother faced as an undiagnosed autistic. My sister is also convinced that my father’s diagnosis should include autism.

Without understanding the full implications of their neurological limitations, my parent’s both failed to establish friendships outside of our nuclear family. My mother came home from working long hours as a nurse in full burn out every day, venting frustrations as she wrestled with a negative self image that had built up over years of not being able to live up to the standards of society. Her best friend was my nanny, Carol Hennessy, a surrogate grandmother to my sister and me.

A polio survivor, Carol was severely handicapped. She moved in with my family when I was 5 years old because she needed a place to stay and we had a spare room. When I was 12 years old my parents sought to buy their first home, and included accommodations for Carol in their search. Carol held my family together.

My mother was terrified of offending Carol’s deep faith (Carol was raised Catholic and converted to the Mormon faith when she was 30 years old) and losing her; my mother recognized how critical Carol was to the survival of our family. Likewise, as a result of my mother’s frequent autistic meltdowns (unexplained as they were considering my mother lacked a proper diagnosis), Carol was terrified that she would upset my mother and end up getting kicked out. As a result, though these women loved each other deeply, the only time they spent together was during our corporate family events (when we weren’t at each others throats). The healthiest example of friendship I had growing up was the relationship between these two women; who had learned to communicate primarily through passive aggressive sticky notes by the time I left home to attend university.

As a kid I recognized that something was wrong with the way I experienced the world, and eventually sought therapy. My Junior year in high school I coerced my parents to help me transfer schools and connect me with a therapist. I struggled to understand how to form connections with my peers, and now recognize the rejection sensitive dysphoria that plagued me. While I remained a straight A student with a 4.0 GPA studying calculus, I had developed coping mechanisms that included faking illnesses in order to avoid the social torment that high school had become. Unfortunately my therapist was not helpful.

During our sessions I shared my struggles, and reflected on various implications that resulted from my experiences. My therapist frequently marvelled at the depth of my self awareness, and openly admitted that he had no idea how to diagnose me. After several months with him he referred me to a psychologist in order for me to be prescribed anti-depressants, in spite of his tentative diagnosis for me; bi-polar disorder. I don’t think he believed I was bi-polar as he acknowledged that the diagnostic criteria for bi-polar disorder didn’t really fit my symptoms, but he couldn’t come up with any other diagnosis that had a better fit; that was in the early 2000's.

My father was widowed when my mother passed away, a week before my wedding in 2010. My father and I sat in her hospital room when they ‘pulled the plug’ and together we watched my mother slowly suffocate to death. Her DNR was clear, we couldn’t leave her on the respirator, and as a chronic smoker her lungs had been damaged so severely they could no longer absorb oxygen effectively.

My father remarried a couple years after my mother passed. His third wife was openly bisexual, having a history of relationships not unlike my father, with both men and women. She was 10 years his senior, and passed away several years after their marriage, widowing my father a second time.

And at this point we come full circle to my father’s coming out story, motivated by a catfish who had my father convinced he was going to marry a 33 year old travel blogger, and body builder that goes by the handle Peachyboy on social media. To that catfish, thank you; you’ve provided me with an opportunity to reflect more deeply on events that have shaped my life; the legacy of a child prostitute.

My father's memoir should be an engaging read, though I expect it will take some time for him to complete it.","Legacy of a Child Prostitute: Reflecting on Generational Trauma CW --->>> This post contains stories of pedophilia, child prostitution and more.

My father and I sat in her hospital room when they ‘pulled the plug’ and together we watched my mother slowly suffocate to death. Her DNR was clear, we couldn’t leave her on the respirator, and as a chronic smoker her lungs had been damaged so severely they could no longer absorb oxygen effectively.

My father remarried a couple years after my mother passed. His third wife was openly bisexual, having a history of relationships not unlike my father, with both men and women. She was 10 years his senior, and passed away several years after their marriage, widowing my father a second time.

And at this point we come full circle to my father’s coming out story, motivated by a catfish who had my father convinced he was going to marry a 33 year old travel blogger, and body builder that goes by the handle Peachyboy on social media. To that catfish, thank you; you’ve provided me with an opportunity to reflect more deeply on events that have shaped my life; the legacy of a child prostitute.

My father's memoir should be an engaging read, though I expect it will take some time for him to complete it.",2,0,2023-11-15 19:06,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/17w10ug/legacy_of_a_child_prostitute_reflecting_on/,Neutral
18295,17vh1ca,post,"I just want to be happy about my relationship with my parents, but I struggle to be","I'm in my late 20s and an only child. I'm very lucky to have been brought up by really loving supportive parents, growing up they were there for me and always wanted what's best for me. They were/are a bit overbearing but it's nothing too bad. They've always loved me. Unconditionally, I thought.

Except, I came out to them. In the original version of this thread I went into great detail but to keep it short - I came out as bi, they were extremely mad, they were supporting me financially at university at the time and threatened to take me out of there if I didn't ""stop acting gay"" (I wasn't ""acting"" gay, I'd never dated in my life because I wanted it all to be out in the open). My dad said I don't love him and only use him for financial security (which is not true). After that fiasco they never ever brought up my sexuality, never asked if I have a partner, etc, the subject has been avoided altogether.  
I thought I'd just act on my opposite-sex attraction and keep them happy. I never did act on it, because I actually didn't experience it. I'm not into men. Turns out I'm a lesbian so I tried to come out a second time. Went just as badly. It's been 3 years since that second attempt and once again they have simply never ever acknowledged it.

When we don't talk about it - so all of the time - they're so nice and kind to me, they really do truly love and support me. I know on reddit, to a stranger, it sounds weird but they do really love me and care about me and their behaviour only ever changes if I bring up that I'm queer.  
It's taken me years of therapy to even attempt dating. I have never had a relationship. I've been on a few dates over the past couple years. It's so challenging for me to feel able to date openly. I thought I'd broken through a wall lately and I was comfortable with who I was, but now...

I'm in a very precarious position, about to lose my job and even with 3 months of job hunting I haven't found anything, I'm really lost professionally and not sure if I'm even on the right career path despite having been working in my field for quite a few years now. It's a field I once loved before a bunch of things led to the present moment (me being in a precarious position is universal to everyone working in it, not just me). I feel very disenchanted. I don't know where to turn because it's all I've ever wanted to do and suddenly not only is there very little opportunity to do it, I don't know if I even want to do it. 

I have confided in my parents and they have been very understanding and supportive. They know I'm doing everything I can and it's not for lack of trying that I'm struggling. For the time being, I have savings and can last a while without any work, but my parents have gone above and beyond in offering to help support me so I can keep my savings. I want to get a job, any job, even if it doesn't relate to my field in any way, as soon as possible, but they've urged me to take my time and reflect on what I want to do and how to proceed next, for which they're offering their support. Neither of them was supported by their parents to pursue their passion or their full potential, so I can see them trying really hard to do everything they can to ensure I get all of the support they didn't, and feel happy and fulfilled. That means so much to me. I appreciate it so much and I'm so lucky. 

But I can't stop thinking about what my dad said when I came out.

""You don't love me, you're only using me for financial security.""

Those words hurt so much then and they hurt so much now. I love my parents so much. But the financial security they're offering me only makes me think that it's conditional. They don't know it's conditional, but if they see me in a relationship with another woman, it will become conditional. It will get brought up. ""We supported you and you betrayed us"". I can feel all the work I've done to be able to date crumbling. I know I shouldn't accept my parents' financial support - I have savings and am planning on taking a job as soon as possible - but I can't straight up turn down their support. It's not about the money for me, or them. If I say I don't want their support, they get hurt and offended. They feel rejected. Even the implication of me not wanting their help got twisted when I tried to gently say they should focus on themselves not me, they keep saying I'm their raison d'être. Which in other circumstances would mean a lot to me. It does mean a lot to me. But I know rejecting their support will hurt them and ruin our relationship, that's taken so long to heal - I don't know about on their behalf, but it took me a lot of years and a lot of therapy to feel comfortable with and loved by them again. 

If I were braver, whenever the tell me ""we fully support you, you have us"", I'd respond ""even if I'm still a lesbian?"" but... I can't. I don't have the strength because I don't want to jeopardize my relationship with my parents. I'm so lucky to have them. I'm so lucky compared to a lot of my peers, I can't believe I'm upset that wahhh, mommy and daddy love me sooo much and want to pay my rent while I figure my shit out!! Woe is me!! It sounds so stupid and pathetic. But I just wish I could be grateful without having doubts. I wish I could feel loved and supported without feeling that love and support is conditional. 

I will probably delete this post in a day or two but I needed to let it out because this is so painful and I should be happy and grateful yet I'm here having thoughts like ""I will never be able to date until they die"" which is a horrible thought. I don't want them to die! I don't want to even be thinking about this! I don't want that to ever be a thought that occurs in my head ever again! I just want to be loved by my parents and feel free to love someone else instead of feeling like one will always cost me the other.

18296,17tv4kc,post,I don’t like him touching me anymore.,"Growing up I (m 30) never really had much physical interaction except for hugs or kisses on the cheeks from friends or relatives when they’d come over to visit but my parents rarely showed any physical affection to us and I think that that’s where my constant crave for physical attention stemmed from. 

Whenever I had relationships (both male and female) I liked being all cuddled up and snug on the couch watching movies, putting my head on their lap as they played with my hair or vice versa cute romantic stuff you know? That’s how I found out that physical touch is my love language, the butterflies I got, the warmth I felt, the way I felt at peace.

Fast forward to today: my husband(m 35) isn’t a very physical person outside of kisses, hugs and sex. When we first met, I’d purposely sit close to him on the couch and try and snuggle with him and he’d just pull away and say “he wasn’t comfortable in the position he was sitting in” or I’d try and cuddle him while going to sleep and he’d distance himself away from me. I’d rest my head on his lap and he’d always get up a second later to go “get something” so eventually I just started getting the hint and stopped trying to be physically affectionate over the 10 years we’ve been together. I love my husband very much the physical affection is the only issue. 

Well over the years I could feel that love language start to slowly deteriorate, I didn’t like hugging ANYBODY for too long because it would give me a sense of uncomfortableness, well over the last couple months my husband has started to want to become more affectionate physically and I hate the way it makes me feel when I’m touched. Like it makes my skin crawl, so I just pull away and don’t say anything, if he sits next to me on the couch I’ll shimmy over to the other side gradually. A few days ago he tried to lay his head on my lap after he had already been trying and failing to cuddle me and I had already told him a couple times to stop…but then I kind of snapped and said “Can you stop?! We’ve never don’t shit like this! Cut it out!” And you can tell that he got offended and sad by it. 

I feel like such an asshole and I feel even worse knowing that I can’t feel the way I used to when all I did was crave someone’s touch.","I don’t like him touching me anymore.

18297,17mvw5j,post,Husband said nobody in our house loves him anymore :’(,"Hi, my husband and I (26m & 25f) recently lost our cat of 14 years (9 for him— we’re high school sweethearts) who was his best friend. He was her chosen person, and she was his little familiar. We have two other cats still, and both love him but are bonded more with me. We’ve been traveling a lot outside of our time zone and both of us began working extensive hours since we recently came home from a trip, so we’re exhausted (like falling asleep at 7 PM on the couch every night, exhausted). Because of all of that, our intimacy has been lacking a bit. Not dead bedroom or anything, just less frequent than usual. And our day to day interactions have also felt less lovey dovey from before—especially from his side (at least, that’s my perception). 
So this morning, we woke up before alarms suddenly (cats, amiright lol) and he tried to initiate sex, which was really nice and normally I’m down, but I was still so tired, so I told him that I didn’t want to have sex at that moment. I even explained my perception of the lack of intimacy lately and how I need more of that because it makes me more receptive to sex.
We go back to sleep, wake up from alarms, and he tried to hug one of our other cats good morning. Well, she’s feisty (unlike our cat that passed) and she got offended. So then my husband says, “Nobody in this house loves me anymore.” 

:’( 

Honestly, him saying that has been a fear of mine since our cat passed. I know how it feels to lose your first familiar and the hole that they leave in your heart. I know he said it jokingly, but I believe every joke has a grain of truth. And I’m afraid that a part of him genuinely feels this way lately. I don’t know what to do, but I don’t want him to feel like he isn’t loved because he is, very much.

18298,171ohns,post,Is she lying about being pregnant?,"I ended things with a girl that I was talking to and 1 day later she texted me that she’s pregnant. Here we are a month later and there has been a lot of red flags that lead me to believe this is a lie and I need advice on how to get her to either admit the truth or in the case that it isn’t a lie, take the proper steps to begin mapping out how to handle this and prepare for a baby. 

First to give some background I have to mention another potential lie that was used to keep in contact when I tried to end things a few weeks prior. 

 Within a day of ending things, I started getting weird Instagram DMs from her own Instagram account saying that this was her best friend from her home country who logged into the account to tell me that the girl I ended things with is missing. I found it very odd that her best friend wasn’t messaging me from her own account. Anyway, she mentioned that she knew she was in possession of strong prescription medications (which she brought here from her country, not prescribed to her but to a family member who did not come here) and after hours of trying to figure out what was going on she finally answered the phone when I called her and she said that she was in the hospital because she accidentally took the medication. Still from her Instagram account, her friend then asked me to not end things with her and keep talking to her because she’s worried. I didn’t know what to do, so I kept talking to her and felt totally trapped until I couldn’t do it anymore and tried to end it for good a few weeks later, which brings us to the the pregnancy story. 

Again, after 1 day of ending things for good, I get a message from her saying that she’s pregnant. In her initial message to me she said that she was going to end it and that she’s only telling me to clear her conscious and that my opinion on the matter won’t be taken into consideration. 
Then, about a week after, she messaged me again and said that she isn’t sure if she wants to end the pregnancy anymore. At this point I have not been shown any positive pregnancy tests or proof so I insisted on going to the doctor with her for testing and consultation, which she refused because she claims she didn’t want to be pressured (for clarification, I did not pressure her at all or try to influence her toward a decision). 
A few days go by and she said that she went to the doctor alone without notifying me and sends me an email from a clinic saying that her test results are ready. she said that she won’t be opening the results because she was too busy with other things going on and couldn’t handle it. 2 weeks go by of me asking every few days for the result until she finally says that she saw that it’s positive but that she has reigned in her emotions and decided that she is going to end it again. Still not sending me any results just saying that she saw it was positive. Following this, she sent me updates on her doctor visits and the process that she chose to end it then she says that she’s too busy again and this is going to take a long time to get her things in order to do this with no timeline in mind, just that it’s going to take a long time but constantly reassuring that she has it handled and not to worry. 

This is really stressful and I just want a solid answer of what’s going on so I know what preparations to make or if I can go back to living my life. 

She is telling me that the doctor told her she actually has low fertility and this pregnancy was a rare occurrence as a result of her switching contraceptive methods. She says that she switched from the pill to a hormonal IUD, which was inserted during the last week of July. None of this was disclosed to me at the time. The only possible night of conception would have been August 11th, where we had unprotected sex but there was no internal ejaculation (not even close like not a quick pull out or anything like that, 10+ minutes of oral for external ejaculation). She says that the combination of her low fertility and switching contraceptive methods caused her to produce excess progesterone allowing for this rare pregnancy. I don’t know anything about this stuff but wouldn’t the 10+ days of having the IUD be enough time for it to take effect? 

Anyway, here are the red flags that lead me to believe this is could be all be a lie: 

#1 - she sent me a picture of an email from the clinic saying that her test results are ready. She said she sent this to get rid of any doubts that I might have. When I said this is just an email and asked for the actual results she got very upset. Paragraphs about how wrong it is not to trust her word then said she will not be sending it because she doesn’t want me to have personal information about her hormone levels. 

#2 - I said if she doesn’t want me to have personal information about her hormones then would she be willing to take a pharmacy test with me? She flipped out and got super offended and basically made me out to be this evil person for not taking her word (I have not accused her whatsoever, just simply asking for test results and to take a test with me). She said she doesn’t have to show me any test because she is asking me for anything. I don’t know, this feels like manipulation. Why wouldn’t she want to prove what she’s saying? I never said anything about lying, she is the only one who brought up lying saying that she has no reason to lie. 

#3 - She said that she still has her IUD in place and that she has no reason to remove it since she’s going to end the pregnancy anyway; wouldn’t this be a big no-no from the doctor to leave this in even if she said she’s going to terminate the pregnancy? Looking it up online, it says there’s risk of a ecotopic pregnancy and 55% chance of miscarriage from leaving this in? Am I mistaken? 

#4 - She said she has not told anyone. No family or friends. I mean I kind of understand this but she specifically mentioned her best friend multiple times in the past and has described her as a sister and that helps her through all of her tough situations.

#5 - The frequency at which she is able to get these supposed appointments. I’ve checked this clinic online and saw no availability for weeks and somehow she was able to go to appointments on the drop of a dime with no issue? She won’t let me go to any appointment with her or even just drive her. 

#6 - Recently, she was saying really weird things like she was going to take all of this prescription medication that she has (she says she brought it here from her home country, is that even possible?) so I got nervous that she was basically saying she’s gonna kill herself so I said I was going to bring her to the hospital but she freaked out and said that I can’t bring her to the hospital because she’s not a citizen and she will get in trouble. Light bulb went off in my head that she told me she was in the hospital a few weeks ago when I originally tried to end things. I didn’t say anything because I was scared she was going to jump out of my moving car, which she kind of implied, so I let it go to calm her down. 

I haven’t pressed too hard as she’s constantly saying she’s handling it and doesn’t want any input or help but at this point it feels like she’s using this to try to keep in contact with me and to control me.","Is she lying about being pregnant?

Following this, she sent me updates on her doctor visits and the process that she chose to end it then she says that she’s too busy again and this is going to take a long time to get her things in order to do this with no timeline in mind, just that it’s going to take a long time but constantly reassuring that she has it handled and not to worry. 

This is really stressful and I just want a solid answer of what’s going on so I know what preparations to make or if I can go back to living my life. 

She is telling me that the doctor told her she actually has low fertility and this pregnancy was a rare occurrence as a result of her switching contraceptive methods. She says that she switched from the pill to a hormonal IUD, which was inserted during the last week of July. None of this was disclosed to me at the time. The only possible night of conception would have been August 11th, where we had unprotected sex but there was no internal ejaculation (not even close like not a quick pull out or anything like that, 10+ minutes of oral for external ejaculation). She says that the combination of her low fertility and switching contraceptive methods caused her to produce excess progesterone allowing for this rare pregnancy. I don’t know anything about this stuff but wouldn’t the 10+ days of having the IUD be enough time for it to take effect? 

Anyway, here are the red flags that lead me to believe this is could be all be a lie: 

#1 - she sent me a picture of an email from the clinic saying that her test results are ready. She said she sent this to get rid of any doubts that I might have. When I said this is just an email and asked for the actual results she got very upset. Paragraphs about how wrong it is not to trust her word then said she will not be sending it because she doesn’t want me to have personal information about her hormone levels. 

#2 - I said if she doesn’t want me to have personal information about her hormones then would she be willing to take a pharmacy test with me? She flipped out and got super offended and basically made me out to be this evil person for not taking her word (I have not accused her whatsoever, just simply asking for test results and to take a test with me). She said she doesn’t have to show me any test because she is asking me for anything. I don’t know, this feels like manipulation. Why wouldn’t she want to prove what she’s saying? I never said anything about lying, she is the only one who brought up lying saying that she has no reason to lie. 

#3 - She said that she still has her IUD in place and that she has no reason to remove it since she’s going to end the pregnancy anyway; wouldn’t this be a big no-no from the doctor to leave this in even if she said she’s going to terminate the pregnancy? Looking it up online, it says there’s risk of a ecotopic pregnancy and 55% chance of miscarriage from leaving this in? Am I mistaken? 

#4 - She said she has not told anyone. No family or friends. I mean I kind of understand this but she specifically mentioned her best friend multiple times in the past and has described her as a sister and that helps her through all of her tough situations.

#5 - The frequency at which she is able to get these supposed appointments. I’ve checked this clinic online and saw no availability for weeks and somehow she was able to go to appointments on the drop of a dime with no issue? She won’t let me go to any appointment with her or even just drive her. 

#6 - Recently, she was saying really weird things like she was going to take all of this prescription medication that she has (she says she brought it here from her home country, is that even possible?) so I got nervous that she was basically saying she’s gonna kill herself so I said I was going to bring her to the hospital but she freaked out and said that I can’t bring her to the hospital because she’s not a citizen and she will get in trouble. Light bulb went off in my head that she told me she was in the hospital a few weeks ago when I originally tried to end things. I didn’t say anything because I was scared she was going to jump out of my moving car, which she kind of implied, so I let it go to calm her down. 

I haven’t pressed too hard as she’s constantly saying she’s handling it and doesn’t want any input or help but at this point it feels like she’s using this to try to keep in contact with me and to control me.",1,4,2023-10-06 21:35,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/171ohns/is_she_lying_about_being_pregnant/,Neutral
18299,16z20au,post,My (43F) Boyfriend's (42M) rants and complaining are affecting my mental health,"TLDR: I feel useless trying to help my boyfriend because he never takes my advice but feels down all the time. I tried to help his daughter but he said I made her cry instead. His rants and triggered behavior are affecting my emotional state.  
  
  
This is gonna be  a long post, so apologies in advance. My (43F) boyfriend (42M) has his own dreams and wants to be ""big"". I'm supportive and have encouraged him to go for it. He has a daughter that I love, but she's a teenager and I don't see her as my own child because we don't have a mother daughter relationship. This is important to the story.   
We have a very satisfying sex life, we've shared lots of laughter except for when he vents.   
  
I'm very excited to help a friend who's very involved with pet charities. Sometimes I help her do the trapping, but I'm more comfortable making donations. I'm blessed to be in a position to help fly abandoned pets and count on other friends who are glad to also financially support operations. I thought I would get Chuck’s support but I guess that’s not gonna happen. He says my involvement with these charities is damaging because I get overly emotionally invested. I have a very close friend who is helping raise funds for a network of free range pet sanctuaries. When he heard the amount I pledged, he got triggered and basically went on a monologue about how we need to help people before animals. I reminded him that I also donate to charities directed at helping vulnerable people (homeless, single mothers, the  elderly or children in abusive environments) but pets have no voice and are often innocent and silent victims. I don’t know what I said for him to get  deeply disturbed by this.   
  
I understand that he's been traumatized by his unmet expectations. He always sounds resentful towards not having been chosen in different situations. I also got very worried about my choices making him feel like he's being left behind, but sometimes I felt doubtful about sharing anything because his reactions tend to get sour and I end ultimately feeling guilty but not really knowing what I'm doing wrong.   
  
He started asking for business advice, which I gave. I warned him against what he wanted to do because of high risks but he got offended. He wanted to open a bar in a small guest house. I get his idea. The place is charming, somewhat secluded yet accessible from the highway, but it’s a rural area in a small town in an area that sees almost zero car activity after 5pm because its only neighboring property is a tiny strip mall with 9 to 5 activity. He did it anyway, and it only lasted 3 months, the last 3 weeks  being for emptying it out . He was very depressed and seemed a bit lost. So I tried to be supportive by taking him out on dates and helping him get distracted. I don’t know if my approach was wrong but he got worse and worse and his negativity affected our relationship. Chuck constantly curses at his ex for leaving him “to rot” (she became wealthy after their break up) and has long periods where i’ve felt truly helpless. Sometimes he says I’m not gonna be able to help him. Sometimes he texts and says everything I said to him in order to lift him up was awesome and that he feels like new, but tells me days later that he feels awful.  
I feel like a refill machine. Honestly, whenever he says he’s gonna need all my support, I get very tense. I’ve tried to convince him to work on himself but he says that’s not necessary, because he’s suffering because of what other people have done.   
  
I can't deal with his aggressive complaints because I feel somehow responsible when he compares himself to me. I even shared stories about my past financial hardship to help him understand that bad things need not last forever. I also told him that around that day when we were having that conversation( as in “on this week,  12 years ago”), I was sleeping on a crappy floor mattress and sometimes  tried to sleep on the bare floor to see if it was better, and that I felt invincible the very first time that I was able to hold on to a a few hundred dollars and not be penniless by the end of the month.   
  
His reaction was very hurtful. He says I'm romanticizing my past, that I live in the past, and that my Hallmark story isn't helping because I'm comparing him to a loser version of myself that he doubts really happened.  
  
I'm deeply enamored by the sense of community I get from the groups I help support. I'm proud of my friends who are giving back without a media tour. I'm very, very happy when someone is offered a safe place to live. I'm also extremely proud of having taken in very sick cats that have been bouncing back, one of them after emergency treatment because she was literally dying. I'm not qualified to tell anyone what they have to do with their lives so I'm just focused on my own. I don't want to close the door on him but I don't know how to handle his behavior.   
His daughter flunked her last year of high school and is dragging her feet to get her equivalent. I’ve tried to be helpful by encouraging her because she does need a diploma. She had been too focused on the future and not doing the actual work and this is the result.   
  
His idea of helping her is to help her start a business, like it was easy. I don’t believe she should be rewarded, there is a process in life and she needs to understand that. He says she’s a free thinker and that what I said was damaging and that she cried on their way home. This is very confusing. I wasn’t harsh or brusque. I was being realistic and she also needs to complete what she started and not let her high school years go to waste. She’s at home all day, no job, just daydreaming and this isn’t healthy. Because of this, now I’m scared of saying anything. 

  
I’m at a loss here. I don’t know how to best help him. I programmed my life to be able to slow down, which is what I’ve been doing but sometimes our relationship  feels very draining.

18300,16mkbfo,post,"Soon to be wife is making my life a living hell,","Hello, I’m not a native English speaker, so forgive my writing. I’ve written this in a rush.  
  
My soon to be wife does not respect me. I (36M) and she (42F) know each other for 4 years and been together for 2 and a half years. During this time, she has treated me like a child in many instances. For example, we’re at a restaurant and I am already decided on what to order. She asks me what I would like to order, I tell her and what follows is her trying to make me order something else that is “better for me”. Please take note that I exercise regularly and I am careful with what I eat. This happens a lot and in many situations.  
  
For instance, I was washing my car and she was inside, waiting and watching. Even though she saw me wash my car dozens of times before, she insisted on getting out of the car to tell me to lift the wipers and wash under them as well, because “that’s how she does it when washing her car”.  
  
In our sex life, after hundreds of times of having sex, it was only me that initiated the sex. She only initiated it once in the two and a half years we’ve been together. Before we moved in together, she was constantly late and this was driving me crazy. I talked to her about it and told her how I feel about her being late, I was very respectful about it. What followed was her negating being late, gaslighting, and the likes.  
  
Because she never initiated sex, I was starting to feel unloved, unworthy of affection, I started having a lot of thoughts and questions running through my head. At the same time with her not initiating sex, for several months, she was casually inserting her ex in the conversation. It was something like this: “Oh, the man sitting behind us looks old. He looks 50 but my ex (she would actually say his name) looked much better than him.” These types of comments were eating at me and making me feel very lonely and not good enough. I would often talk to myself in the shower and would talk to myself on the drive home. I also cried many times because of this. When I told her how her behavior makes me feel, she would discard it in the way you discard something a small child would say. I’d feel immediately invalidated, my worries were dwindled and everything she would do to me and how it made me feel was dismissed.  
  
In time, I started to feel very sad and for days I would feel unable to smile and started to resent her. She would blame me for feeling that way by saying she doesn’t like morosely people. So she was basically blaming me for feeling hurt because she’d hurt me. In her mind, it was my fault for feeling this way, in her mind no way did I have a valid reason to feel so sad and hurt as a result of her actions. When I told her point blank that I feel unloved she blurted out with a stupid smile on her face and said “but I feel loved”. That boggled my mind. It’s like everything is about her and I am just some accessory to her pleasure.  
  
Our most recent fight was about having kids. When I first met her, I wanted her to be my wife and one day I thought about having kids with her. But as the relationship moved forward, she started treating me very poorly, talking about her exes (even though I told her that is a big no), even her female best friend told her that speaking to me about her ex boyfriends is a big no, yet still she continued.  
  
Last night, out of the blue, she point blank asked me if we are going to have a child. I said no. We had a fight and it was not pleasant. She fought me saying that I should have told her I don’t want kids. The sad thing is that when she wants something, she doesn’t really care about what I want.  
  
Regardless of my opinion on the matter, when she wants something and wants it bad (like kids) she doesn’t care about my reasons not to have kids. The only thing she understands is having her wish come true.  
  
However, she never takes seriously many of the things I have to say as the man of the house. In many situations, she acts like a man For instance, when we go out to eat, she acts like she’s the man, ordering the food and generally having the attitude of someone who is in charge. She has castrated me so many times I have lost count.  
  
When I tell her about what she does and how it makes me feel, she gaslights me. She says I misunderstand what she does and says, to calm down, etc.  
  
She has anger issues and once her fuse is lit, it’s a big problem. From the moment her fuse is lit, nothing that I do or say will appease her. She needs to get through her anger process until it fades and only then can I start to reason with her a bit. In almost all cases, she doesn’t believe she is in the wrong. She blames almost everything wrong in her life, on me. I have no idea why, but it’s eating at me and hurts me unbelievably.  
  
In terms of finances, I bought a new apartment that I have fully paid for in cash, so no mortgage, and she gets to live with me, has her own room, everything in the apartment is bought and paid for by me.  
  
I mention this because she criticizes me saying that I didn’t do anything for her. Last year, she made about 10K EUR in a year, whereas I have given her cash money about 6K EUR because I love her. Not to mention that during our relationship I bought her many designer shoes (at discount prices, but still), the latest iPhone, latest Macbook pro, I have taken her overseas on vacation. Everytime we go out to eat, I pay 99% of the time. And there are a lot more things I do for her.  
  
Yet, with all these things that I do for her, she scoffed at me saying that I only bought her 2 pairs of shoes amounting to 100 EUR each and that’s it. When I heard this, I was stunned. I could not believe it. In her mind I have done nothing for her. It’s just mind bogglingly soul crushing.  
  
She constantly feels the need to tell me what to do. Sometimes, when I have to do something (a chore) and I make a single mistake (for instance I drop something off a plate that I want to put in the sink) she feels the need to make a joke about it or, if she’s angry, say something mean or belittling to me.  
  
During the first months of our relationship, there was this one instance when we were out drinking and she saw 2 guys. She said one of them is ugly, but the other one is a god.  
  
The way she said that one of the guys is a god, as in he looks very good, made me feel really unwanted. I immediately told her that made me feel bad, but she told me to not make anything of it, because it means nothing. Months after this event, we were talking and I brought it up again and she told me that the reason she said that guy looked so good is because we were still freshly dating. That made no sense to me and it profoundly saddened me.  
  
She also has a habit of delaying sex. I tell her I am in the mood for it, and instead of her jumping on me, she actually delays it as much as possible. She combs her hair, goes in the kitchen to check what’s in the fridge and so on. I feel very left out and sad. Like I always have to beg for affection and physical intimacy. She also uses double standards and plays the victim a lot of the time.  
  
She’s a perpetual victim and she never does any harm nor does she wrong me. It’s me who is always treating her poorly, angering her, basically, it’s my fault for almost everything wrong in her life. When she was 30 years old, she and a couple of her friends went to some Shamballa courses, yea, those types of meetings where she would hug trees, hug her friends, chant, and whatnot. I was stunned. This was a big red flag that I discovered while being in a relationship with her.  
  
There are too many things to write here and as I write these things, I’m asking myself for the hundredth time why I put up with this. I am currently in therapy and suggested her that we both go to therapy, but she vehemently refuses, saying that only the crazy ones (meaning me) need to seek therapy. She literally thinks nothing is wrong with her.  
  
She constantly makes up stories of the way I have done or said something to her, and ends up telling me such a convoluted and weird story of basically how I offended her, that I am taken aback and am in awe of her ability to twist things and play the victim. The way she interprets what I say or do is simply wrong and borders on psychosis. Even though I try to explain her what I actually meant when I said x thing to her, she won’t budge. She still firmly believes her interpretation of my actions is right.  
  
I get yelled out from time to time, for things that I am not responsible for. When I tell her that this is unnecessarily hurting me and is not right, she simply doesn’t acknowledge what I say or dismisses it.  
  
One time, we were talking and out of the blue she blurted “all of my boyfriends have left me when I was at my happiest”. That was very telling to me and made me think long and hard about what she said.  
  
To the plus side, she is very kindhearted, wants to help everybody, and has taught me many things. However, her anger issues and those that I’ve partially managed to describe here are deal breakers.  
  
She also sleeps a lot and given her desire to have a child, it will be me the one who’ll have to mann up and take care of the child. She’ll say she is too tired to wake up in the morning or during the night to take care of the child, feed him, change his clothes, etc. We’re in this together, but the way I know her, it’s certain she’d play the victim card, saying she is too tired and put all the responsibility of taking care of the child on me. That I cannot bear.  
  
When we fight, most of the times she brings up my parents into the fight, telling me that I am like my father or my mother (in a bad way); she has also called my parents psychopaths. She also goes to church very often, is very religious and has many crucifixes all over the house, so much so it looks almost like an altar.  
  
These are just some of the things that she says and does to me. I know I should leave, but I can’t find the strength to leave. I feel so stupid and sad…  
  
TLDR: Soon to be wife is making my life a living hell by torturing me in so many ways that I am just left speechless and a shell of my former self.

Regardless of my opinion on the matter, when she wants something and wants it bad (like kids) she doesn’t care about my reasons not to have kids. The only thing she understands is having her wish come true.  
  
However, she never takes seriously many of the things I have to say as the man of the house. In many situations, she acts like a man For instance, when we go out to eat, she acts like she’s the man, ordering the food and generally having the attitude of someone who is in charge. She has castrated me so many times I have lost count.  
  
When I tell her about what she does and how it makes me feel, she gaslights me. She says I misunderstand what she does and says, to calm down, etc.  
  
She has anger issues and once her fuse is lit, it’s a big problem. From the moment her fuse is lit, nothing that I do or say will appease her. She needs to get through her anger process until it fades and only then can I start to reason with her a bit. In almost all cases, she doesn’t believe she is in the wrong. She blames almost everything wrong in her life, on me. I have no idea why, but it’s eating at me and hurts me unbelievably.  
  
In terms of finances, I bought a new apartment that I have fully paid for in cash, so no mortgage, and she gets to live with me, has her own room, everything in the apartment is bought and paid for by me.  
  
I mention this because she criticizes me saying that I didn’t do anything for her. Last year, she made about 10K EUR in a year, whereas I have given her cash money about 6K EUR because I love her. Not to mention that during our relationship I bought her many designer shoes (at discount prices, but still), the latest iPhone, latest Macbook pro, I have taken her overseas on vacation. Everytime we go out to eat, I pay 99% of the time. And there are a lot more things I do for her.  
  
Yet, with all these things that I do for her, she scoffed at me saying that I only bought her 2 pairs of shoes amounting to 100 EUR each and that’s it. When I heard this, I was stunned. I could not believe it. In her mind I have done nothing for her. It’s just mind bogglingly soul crushing.  
  
She constantly feels the need to tell me what to do. Sometimes, when I have to do something (a chore) and I make a single mistake (for instance I drop something off a plate that I want to put in the sink) she feels the need to make a joke about it or, if she’s angry, say something mean or belittling to me.  
  
During the first months of our relationship, there was this one instance when we were out drinking and she saw 2 guys. She said one of them is ugly, but the other one is a god.  
  
The way she said that one of the guys is a god, as in he looks very good, made me feel really unwanted. I immediately told her that made me feel bad, but she told me to not make anything of it, because it means nothing. Months after this event, we were talking and I brought it up again and she told me that the reason she said that guy looked so good is because we were still freshly dating. That made no sense to me and it profoundly saddened me.  
  
She also has a habit of delaying sex. I tell her I am in the mood for it, and instead of her jumping on me, she actually delays it as much as possible. She combs her hair, goes in the kitchen to check what’s in the fridge and so on. I feel very left out and sad. Like I always have to beg for affection and physical intimacy. She also uses double standards and plays the victim a lot of the time.  
  
She’s a perpetual victim and she never does any harm nor does she wrong me. It’s me who is always treating her poorly, angering her, basically, it’s my fault for almost everything wrong in her life. When she was 30 years old, she and a couple of her friends went to some Shamballa courses, yea, those types of meetings where she would hug trees, hug her friends, chant, and whatnot. I was stunned. This was a big red flag that I discovered while being in a relationship with her.  
  
There are too many things to write here and as I write these things, I’m asking myself for the hundredth time why I put up with this. I am currently in therapy and suggested her that we both go to therapy, but she vehemently refuses, saying that only the crazy ones (meaning me) need to seek therapy. She literally thinks nothing is wrong with her.  
  
She constantly makes up stories of the way I have done or said something to her, and ends up telling me such a convoluted and weird story of basically how I offended her, that I am taken aback and am in awe of her ability to twist things and play the victim. The way she interprets what I say or do is simply wrong and borders on psychosis. Even though I try to explain her what I actually meant when I said x thing to her, she won’t budge. She still firmly believes her interpretation of my actions is right.  
  
I get yelled out from time to time, for things that I am not responsible for. When I tell her that this is unnecessarily hurting me and is not right, she simply doesn’t acknowledge what I say or dismisses it.  
  
One time, we were talking and out of the blue she blurted “all of my boyfriends have left me when I was at my happiest”. That was very telling to me and made me think long and hard about what she said.  
  
To the plus side, she is very kindhearted, wants to help everybody, and has taught me many things. However, her anger issues and those that I’ve partially managed to describe here are deal breakers.  
  
She also sleeps a lot and given her desire to have a child, it will be me the one who’ll have to mann up and take care of the child. She’ll say she is too tired to wake up in the morning or during the night to take care of the child, feed him, change his clothes, etc. We’re in this together, but the way I know her, it’s certain she’d play the victim card, saying she is too tired and put all the responsibility of taking care of the child on me. That I cannot bear.  
  
When we fight, most of the times she brings up my parents into the fight, telling me that I am like my father or my mother (in a bad way); she has also called my parents psychopaths. She also goes to church very often, is very religious and has many crucifixes all over the house, so much so it looks almost like an altar.  
  
These are just some of the things that she says and does to me. I know I should leave, but I can’t find the strength to leave. I feel so stupid and sad…  
  
TLDR: Soon to be wife is making my life a living hell by torturing me in so many ways that I am just left speechless and a shell of my former self.

18301,16dcwvn,post,Struggling with attraction,"I (27M) am really struggling with who I'm attracted to. Since I was 13, females that shouldn't have been doing what they were doing have come onto me in cute ways. My only real relationship, we were both 17, we were eachothers 2nd, it didn't last long because the lifestyle I introduced her to caused her to change. I haven't dated since, and only had sex once after, which made me realize I don't like sex without love. The girl I dated was cute, she guessed 666 on one of those how many jelly beans are in the container, and won, and she got announced in front of the class lol. Once we were smoking tree, and I found her laying in the fetal position in my dining room with the lights out, and she said there were dead people everywhere ctfu. She was super cute though, I find the witchy thing super attractive. Ever since then, the only women I seem to attract are one's that do things I don't find attractive, and females that are too young, no grey. A few of those women tried shaking their ass for me, the first had clap, and I didn't have sex with her, so it ruined it for other women that tried that. Another was a coworker that tried to make me the first white guy she had sex with, she tried to take advantage of me while I was drunk and lure me into a threesome with another woman that wasn't much different. I hate to reject women, it feels so unnatural and makes me feel bad, but I respect myself too much to do anything with women that don't respect themselves. The last one made me feel horrible for years, she was witchy, prettiest woman I've ever saw, but she tried shaking her ass as a last resort, because she didn't know any other way because she didn't value me enough to get to know me, so now I'm extremely discouraged with women my age. I don't even look at them anymore. I'm sorry if you feel attacked, I need some suggestions, I don't know where else to get help. I can't bring this to a therapist. If this isn't a good subreddit, can you point me to a good one? Where do I find grey area women? I've thought about church, I look like Jesus so I'd probably make out like a bandit, but it seems bad to go there for that reason when I won't be able to bring myself to accept the faith. Please don't attack me, I'm really just looking for someone that is like me and if that offends you then idk what to tell you.","Struggling with attraction I (27M) am really struggling with who I'm attracted to.

18302,160b8fw,post,Girlfriend told me I don't know what sexual harassment is because I'm a man,"This happened a while ago while we were having a drink together. And like the title says, she said that because I'm a man I don't understand what sexual harassment is. This obviously offended me but we agreed to have the conversation another time so we didn't ruin our evening. We are still yet to have this conversation. 

However, over dinner earlier this week we were discussing her weekend and she told me her and her mates got a lift home from a party from a drug dealer. I asked if they knew this guy and she told me her friend met him when he pulled along side her and tried to chat her up after a night out. She specifically used the words ""he basically cat called her"". She then goes on to explain how this guy dropped off my gf and one of her mates and then took the friend he knew home to have sex with. I thought this was kinda weird because in my opinion catcalling someone could defo be sexual harassment and also having sex with someone who has just been out drinking at a party while you are sober could also be very dodgy. 

When I said that is kinda fucked up she defended the guy saying how nice he is. The whole conversation rubbed me up the wrong way but I didn't want to start an argument. She also frequently tells me she isn't comfortable walking home alone at night because she doesn't want to be harassed. This annoyed me because she was happy to defend a guy who's behaviour literally contributes to her feeling like that. 

Anyway I need to bring this up with her but idk if I'm overreacting and I don't want to start an argument. Any opinions or criticism of either of us is welcome,  just needed to get this out.","Girlfriend told me I don't know what sexual harassment is because I'm a man This happened a while ago while we were having a drink together.

18303,15wjvjy,post,"The older I get, the more I realize how much I do not respect men and how much they genuinely disgust me.","Long rant but here we go.

“OkAy bUt NoT ALL mEn” shut the fuck up. Yes, not ALL men have the psychopathic urge to rape, kill, and abuse, but ENOUGH men  have done so to the point where it makes women hypervigilant about the entire male population, because they’ll never know if it’ll happen to them at one point in their lives.

You hear “good husbands” killing their own wife and children on the news. You hear the “unsuspecting boy at school” open fire on several of his classmates. Hell, not even dating apps are safe because supposedly, “good, honest men” are kidnapping, raping, and even killing their dates. I know women aren’t excluded from this, because there are multiple instances of women being responsible for rapes and murders as well- but if you look at the statistics, the ratio of male to female offenders reveals that an overwhelming percentage of the male population is responsible for a majority of these kind of crimes. Side note- did you know that mortuaries prefer to hire women because of the fact that men are more likely to fuck a dead corpse? Let that sink in for just a minute.

Disclaimer: the rest of this post is mainly focused on my opinion of/experiences with heterosexual men who are in the working class. The context can ofc differ for everyone depending on race, class, and sexuality.

Something else that REALLY makes me angry: the implicit bias that men are more dependable, and that they are better leaders, decision-makers, and are less “emotional” than women. These same men punch holes in the wall when they’re angry. They hit their wives. They cheat on them. These so-called “leaders” and “providers” come home from work and expect their partners to feed them, clean, have sex with them, tend to their children (if they have any), expect them to listen to and support them emotionally, and provide them with all sorts of other emotional and physical labor because they “just had a long day.” What if their partner also has a full-time job? Why do they have to work full-time then come home to do all of that shit when YOU don’t even want to? Even if they aren’t working and are a stay at home mom, do you know how much of a physical and emotional toll it takes on the body and mind just to be one? A common relationship problem I see on reddit is married men with children posting about how they feel like it’s unfair how their wife won’t have sex with them anymore. Well no fucking shit, bozo. Your wife just had a fourth hole ripped into her body while birthing your child (the amount of men who also don’t know that the urethra and vaginal opening are not the same thing is laughable), is stressed the fuck out trying to take care of them, and her hormones are all over the place. OF COURSE she doesn’t want to have sex with you. Why would she want to get hot and heavy with someone that can’t even remember to take out the trash?

I, myself, have been in long-term relationships where I felt like I was a caregiver, not a girlfriend. I, too, have been pressured into having sex when I already had so much on my plate. I was a victim of physical and sexual abuse by multiple men in my life, and those abusers were the men I thought I could trust. I have been single for a year and a half since my last relationship, and honestly, I have no qualms with being single for the rest of my life.

To end this on a more positive note: if you are a man who actually knows what empathy is and is actively seeking to be more self-aware- i.e. going to therapy, keeping track of patterns in your behavior, exercising self-control and respecting not only yourself but the people around you- then kudos to you. We need more men like you. Please don’t be another statistic. Understand that women have historically been subject to many, many traumatic experiences and that it does not reflect on you as an individual, so long as you do not perpetuate the cycle.","The older I get, the more I realize how much I do not respect men and how much they genuinely disgust me.

18305,15vrzl2,post,The struggle is real,"Tonight has been crap. I'm currently sat in my childhood home alone, remembering my childhood sexual abuse. My brother sexually abuse and groomed me as a child, between the ages of 11-13. I'm currently sleeping in the same room as I did when it happened and have to still try and act nice to the brother who did it to me. I can remember his calling for me, convincing me it was normal, even though my child brain always knew something wasn't right.

My sister and father do not know. My sister is his best friend, my father would shoot him (actually murder him) if he knew. My brother's mental health is borderline as well, and as my mother unhelpfully put it, ""If my brother did something stupid (i.e kill himself), how would she live with herself?""

As if I didn't have to live right now.

My mother knows and is in denial, she doesn't seem to understand that I can't 'just forget and move on'. She has also previously mentioned medicating myself for my mental health as if it will make me forget the abuse I've experienced?

I've confronted my brother (after years of blocking the memories) and now he still acts like everything is normal and is evasive when I want to speak about it.

I feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place, this house is featured in my deepest nightmare, I love my family but can I live with them never understanding what has happened to me? Planning nice to my abuser for the rest of my life?

Suicide has never been an option, it would letting it win, letting my brother's abuse be forgotten. I live for the fact that the day I believe that my brother would do that to another (god forbid a child), I will end him. I can't bring myself to report him though as he remains my brother and I'm highly aware of how much I could ruin his life by being on a sex offenders list (I'm a self hypocrite much). The only reason I'm in this limbo is that he has never shown further committing a repeat offence or touching my sister.

I've had many councillors but they have struggled to figure out how to help me.

Many times I've though of leaving the country, leaving my family behind, but would that help, would it just hurt more? I still love parts of my family. I have no support from family and the very few friends who do know aren't really able to support me because of the complexity of the situation.

18306,15t8r7u,post,Ex got married recently married only months after we broke up,"(Sorry for the typo in the title.) I was with this person for half a decade. Happy it ended when it did (via TEXT he handled our breakup btw.) but the fact I never got the proposal in 5 years but this girl did in 7 ish months makes me feel I was place holder or a learning lesson for this guy.

From cheating on me, lying to me and manipulating the narrative whenever I was catching on to something, and outright being crass/rude often, I look back and get so angry at my self. Of course he kept treating me the way he did because I let it happen and he most like had no respect for me. Who would?

The last few years I gained a bit of weight (35 pounds throughout our relationship and I’m pretty short.) and sex was not as frequent, especially after doing long distance the last few years (he’s in the military.)

During my last visit two different sex workers reached out to his phone, yet he’d either laugh it off as spam or get mad/offended with me when he saw how paranoid and anxiety driven it made me. Then I found realistic silicone sex doll. Looking back it’s built like the wife he currently has, a tall woman with a gorgeous body who was visiting the states from a foreign country.

The month before we broke up I was absolutely done, I don’t want to get into details but I found out was I affected physically because he slept around or hooked up with someone (I’m ok now and it wasn’t anything too serious!). Felt like my body was violated, I was so immensely grossed out by him and my self. He still managed to not take accountability and even tried questioning me, telling me he’d forgive me and love me if I cheated on him. I was so depressed and tired. Yet, I was still waiting for the right time to breakup up since he was at his most suicidal at that point, but knew I had to do it soon. I didn’t love him anymore.

The only reason I found out he got married was because I saw her Instagram pop up with a wedding picture of the two. I almost threw up from the shock. Seems he blocked me and most of our mutual friends, his family also didn’t share anything.

I just feel humiliated. I should have left years earlier like I wanted to, not stay because he would make claims he was lonely, depressed and far too often kid around that he’d  kill himself if I left him or straight up call me crying about how suicidal he was. He also pushed his own friends away, so it’s contradictory how he felt lonely. 

Maybe he changes for this woman, it’s possible he needed his exact physical type to be a better partner. 

Right now I’m just focusing on trying to love my self again, get fit, and convince my self the person I’m currently seeing isn’t the same.","Ex got married recently married only months after we broke up (Sorry for the typo in the title.) I was with this person for half a decade. Happy it ended when it did (via TEXT he handled our breakup btw.) but the fact I never got the proposal in 5 years but this girl did in 7 ish months makes me feel I was place holder or a learning lesson for this guy.

From cheating on me, lying to me and manipulating the narrative whenever I was catching on to something, and outright being crass/rude often, I look back and get so angry at my self. Of course he kept treating me the way he did because I let it happen and he most like had no respect for me. Who would?

The last few years I gained a bit of weight (35 pounds throughout our relationship and I’m pretty short.) and sex was not as frequent, especially after doing long distance the last few years (he’s in the military.)

18307,15oengv,post,I feel taken for granted in my marriage and its terrible...,"So bit of back story...

Me(34m) and my wife(36f) have been togeher for 11 years married for 7. We are currently expecting our first child a girl sometime in november...

Now to the meat of the story we are both in high pressure jobs and while because i start early i finish early, she however works wherever her company needs her so sometimes from home sometimes at the office etc...

Now on to me... I do most of the house work, i cook 90% of the meals. I clean up after her and i am the one that is called upon whenever there is an issue that she needs help with... I barely get a thank you, if im lucky, regardless of what i do. 

This has only gotten worse since we got pregnant, i cook whatever she needs, i bring snacks, her breakfast in the morning, her meds everything that she needs and again no gratitude.

I have spoken to her multiple times about this to no avail, this is inclusive of our bedroom activities, when we first started she was insaitable however now (even before the pregancy) i was lucky if we had any fun once or twice a month, again i have spoken to her and told her that i would never force anything but i would like it if we had more intimancy and that i was at least appreactiate for everything that i do....

So thanks for reading just wanted to get off my chest...

Minor update... So thanks to everyone here for the messages and support just a minor update of what has occurred and I'm currently seething.... So i have talked about with her about everything I'm feeling( well more i just blurted it out one night while in bed) about how i feel under valved in the relationship and unappreciated... She seemed shocked and remorseful, this lasted about all of two days before a work issue( a manager at her office went a bit crazy and shat on everyone) which has consumed the topic of conversation for the last three days. I also brought up MC she said she will think about it....
So anyway tonight i thought id try be a good husband and suggested a date night, we go out have a nice supper and a bit of fun which was great till we got home where after we went to bed i tried to be intimate and was told no, her excuse was she felt like i was trying to buy sex from her... To say im offended is an understatement.

I have told her she hurt me right now that im deeply offended and that was uncalled for, if she wasn't in the mood that's fine im a big boy i can handle rejection but that.... Anyway...

So ive come to a decision, i have a birthday coming up if she makes no effort i am going to reevaluate the marriage and if that means divorce so be it. 
To those who have messaged me about me only wanting to screw her with no respect to get feelings or that she is probably cheating... Firstly how dare you i do love her with every fiber of my being but i refuse to be in another abusive relationship where I'm just a door mat. Secondly i have been cheated on before to which she knows, i have access to get phone and messaged if i want just as she has to mine( i did check sadly i know but cool) also due to the country we live in, it's not the most safe ( we live in south Africa) so we have an app to track each other just in case something happens. So no she isn't cheating.
Also sorry for spelling and grammar English isn't my first language.","I feel taken for granted in my marriage and its terrible... So bit of back story...

18308,15mzr7k,post,I feel like I wasted my teens and early 20s being antisocial,"I'm a 26 year old male and like the title says I feel like I wasted my early 20s. I guess I should give a little bit of background. I'm not religious but I did grow up in a strict dysfunctional household where I just almost never really left the house unless it was for school. I was also kind of that one quiet guy that never really talked but everyone knew. I had a few friends here and there and hung out with them occasionally. I've only had 2 girlfriends with one being in middle school and the last one being in my senior year of high school in 2015. Neither of those relationships lasted for more than 3 months.  
  
I mostly just became a loner and slow faded out of my high school friend groups that I had. It was probably because I was kinda depressed that I had to start taking more responsibility with my life choices on top of the other personal shit I was dealing with. I went through college without really talking to any women unless I had to like group projects, home work, anything school related, etc. I focused mainly on my classes. (I think I'm just introverted as hell) I did end up failing twice out of a school and had to switch over to a new one. This made me focus even harder on school since I had loans built up already and if I failed a third time I would have no way to pay them off.  
  
Fast forward to now, I am a registered nurse at a hospital making good money, I go to the gym 3 days a week since I work 3 overnights on weekends Friday, Saturday, Sunday so I can bank on weekend and nightshift differentials for a bigger paycheck. Which leaves me with one day of the week to do whatever I want. The money is nice but I also feel empty as hell since this is pretty much what the rest of my life will be like, working 3 nights a week until the day I die.  
  
My mom recently started asking me when I'll find a girlfriend to give her grandchildren and I've always told her I don't want to get married or have kids. Same with my dad. But recently their questions started becoming more and more frequent to the point of annoyance. It got to a point where there was a party with a few family friends and I ended up walking in late since I didn't really want to go in the first place but somehow got convinced to come. I walk in and somehow I end up being the center of attention and the first thing that's asked to me is if I have a girlfriend. I had to answer no and it was so fucking awkward to me. They started asking questions like why etc. and I just said I don't know then hid a room where no one was and was just browsing reddit and YouTube on my phone for the majority of time.  
  
I am also a virgin and just wanted to state that being a virgin never really bothered me until recently that is. I was at work one night where it wasn't busy at all. Since I'm a nurse most of my coworkers are all female and I for the most part stay out of their conversations usually sitting in places where no one really sits at and just minding my own business. I ended up being dragged into their conversation where they were talking about sex, the best they've had and their first times. They started asking me all these questions about my experiences and when I told them that I've never had sex they refused to believe it. They think I'm just fucking around with them even after I told them I was serious. They really think that I go sleeping around with people when I really don't. (not trying to offend people that do) I guess they told everyone at work cuz now literally everyone started asking If I was really a virgin since it was hard for them to believe saying I don't look like one at all.  
  
Now when someone asks if I'm a virgin I lie and say no and tell them my body count is like 2 to avoid this kind of bullshit from happening again. It never really bothered me with how lived my life but now it's starting to get to my head. I'm 26 with next to experience with dating and I've never had sex. I don't know if I want to start or if I even should since societal pressures is what made me even want to write all this out in the first place.

18309,15j58q6,post,i created a monster.,"ldr with my bf. the first time i saw his dick in a picture, i said ""i've seen better"" as a joke. we would pick on each other like that -- or so i thought that was our dynamic. turns out i was wrong. ever since, he's been insecure about his dick. he hates the idea of not being the biggest dick i've ever seen. he hates the idea of people somehow being better than him because, in his head, big dick = better.


i've told him more times than i can even count, that i wasn't serious when i said that i've seen better. i've apologized. i've cried. i've pleaded. i can't undo what i said. he blames me for his insecurities. 


after a year of dating we finally met up. his dick was too big for me. he would accidentally hurt me during sex by hitting my cervix and would have to change it up. he didn't believe that it was actually hurting me. he thinks i lie about the pain. at one point, he rammed his entire dick in me and it was one of the worst pains i'd ever felt. i cried. he said he'd never do it again. yet he thinks i'm overreacting to that. he tells me that it ""wasn't that bad"". 




he is convinced, somehow, that i want a dick that is bigger than his. he's a little over 7inches. he doesn't believe me when i say i don't want a bigger dick. he doesn't believe me when i say that a dicks 8inches and over are weird-looking, impractical, not functional, and just gross.




just recently he screamed at me because i couldn't tell him if a 6in, 7in, or 8in dick is ""nicer to look at"". he wanted an answer and wouldn't let it go. my honest answer is that i have no idea because i do not give a fuck about dick size. not that you can even really tell the difference between a 6, 7, or 8 inch dick. 




jfc. my ex was under 6inches and it didn't even matter to me. our issue there was that we were both virgins and neither of us had enough sexual experience to be able to use it.




my bf also complained that i don't compliment his dick enough even though i'm in awe of it every time i see it and i tell him all the time how much i love it and how big/huge it is. i used to say ""giant"" until he decided that i was lying about that word, so i decided to stop using it to avoid a fight over the word. then suddenly he has a problem with me NOT using the word too. 




my bf is a size queen. king? he is obsessed with big dicks. he is insecure over his 7inch dick ""not being enough for me"" even though i've literally never complained once. i made him insecure. he constantly tells me that i am the reason that he is insecure. i fucked up. i created this monster. i can't do anything to stop it. i can't fucking win. i am going to hear for the rest of my life that i fucked him up. 




he got mad at me because i told him that, yeah, people with bigger dicks exist. do i care? no. the only dick i care about is his. he was so offended that i could even say that bigger dicks exist. he told me to go date someone with a bigger dick. another time he showed me a picture of a 9inch dick, asking me if it looked bigger or similar to his. then he got mad at me and himself because he subjected my eyes to a 9inch dick, and somehow that meant that the random fucking person is better than him.




i try to be patient about his insecurity and i try to help him out. but all this fighting (used to be monthly but it seems to be every other day now) is annoying the piss out of me and it's turning me off. we haven't done anything sexually in days because his constant arguing about his dick size is a turn off. sometimes even after we masturbate together (because ldr) he'll start arguing with me about his dick size and how i really feel about it, and it makes me regret doing anything sexual with him. it discourages me from doing sexual things with him in the future for fear that he'll start an argument.

18310,15g2tdv,post,My sister in-law isn't being a mother to her own daughter,"My sister in law (F21) got pregnant back in March of 2021 (that would make her 19 then). My husband (M24) and I was suspicious since we found out my husband's 17 year old sister got pregnant in January of that year too. It could have been coincidence but my husband and I believe that she wanted the attention of being pregnant too but were just guessing at this point.

My husband recently told me that he was upset about an argument he had with his sister and mom. He started telling me about how it's strange that the only person who seems like is raising his niece is his mother. I didn't understand but then he started to tell me about how almost all the time he was talking to his mother over facetime or a phone call she always has the baby. To understand the situation, his sister lives with his mother and does work. So for her to be always around the baby would be normal since she lives at home but not all the time. His mom and step dad has been the only one to send us any updates about her or pictures of her. His sister is very active on social media and she's never posted any pictures of her baby. She did post the sonogram image when she announced her pregnancy but it's been deleted. She once told us that she didn't want to post pictures of her baby because her baby daddy's uncle was on the sex offender registry but they ended up breaking up and she edited her settings so only friends can see her pictures. So his mom and step dad has been the only one to send us any updates about her or pictures of her. So my husband brought it up to his sister asking what's going on and she flew into a screaming fit for asking her why aren't we getting updates from her or why it seems like his mom is raising her child. She told us we can't have a say or opinion on what she does as an adult because we don't have any kids of our own. A while after that happened he tried to talk to his mom about whats going on and she's made it sound like she's okay with raising her granddaughter and she's not complaining about it. 

It makes me upset that his sister isn't taking the responsibility of being a parent and I feel horrible for that little girl not having a mom to actually be mom. I'm just bothered by the idea of she's trying to put on a show that she's not a mother and has no responsibilities. It makes me frustrated seeing her hand  her kid off to their mother to do the job she wanted to do. I sometimes feel like I'm going crazy for seeing this as an issue and no one else in his family is saying anything about it but us.","My sister in-law isn't being a mother to her own daughter My sister in law (F21) got pregnant back in March of 2021 (that would make her 19 then).

A while after that happened he tried to talk to his mom about whats going on and she's made it sound like she's okay with raising her granddaughter and she's not complaining about it. 

It makes me upset that his sister isn't taking the responsibility of being a parent and I feel horrible for that little girl not having a mom to actually be mom. I'm just bothered by the idea of she's trying to put on a show that she's not a mother and has no responsibilities. It makes me frustrated seeing her hand  her kid off to their mother to do the job she wanted to do. I sometimes feel like I'm going crazy for seeing this as an issue and no one else in his family is saying anything about it but us.",1,0,2023-08-02 8:13,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/15g2tdv/my_sister_inlaw_isnt_being_a_mother_to_her_own/,Neutral

18312,158n8n2,post,I shouldn't have called twice to that number... now I can't get all that happened out of my mind,"This story is quite long and with many details to take into account, but I'll try to be as brief as possible.  
  
SPOILER: I DIDN'T MANAGE TO BE BRIEF, THIS TEXT IS VERY LONG  
  
It all began in January of this year when my best friend, whom I'll call María, had a sleepover at my house. We were cooking, watching videos, and so on. When it was already nighttime, we decided to make some prank calls (a bit risqué) to people we knew. I gave her some contact numbers of mine, and she did the same, and it was all very fun. Suddenly, she asked if I could prank her thesis partner, whom we'll call Pedro (for context, in May 2022, we also had a sleepover, and she had already asked me to prank call him back then. I remember calling him, but he just said ""hello"" and hung up). Now, knowing this, I told her it wasn't a good idea to call him again since he didn't answer last time in May 2022. However, María insisted so much that I ended up calling Pedro's number again. And just like before, he picked up and hung up immediately. **I called a second time, and this is where what I believe to be the biggest butterfly effect of my year began.**

As I mentioned before, these pranks were a bit risqué. So, I started the call moaning and telling him that I wanted phone sex. To my surprise, unlike other hot-blooded guys, he jokingly replied, ""No, friend, I'm a Christian, but if you want, I can give you the number of a friend who might be interested."" That response made me interested in him because I liked his way of handling things and his sense of humor. When the call was over, I told María, ""Hey, your friend is cool, he took it with humor, hahaha."" She replied, ""Yeah, he's cool"". Then she said, ""Owww, maybe this is the beginning of a beautiful story.""  
  
After that, I asked her to show me a picture of Pedro, but she had nothing to show me as he didn't post pictures on social media or WhatsApp, so there was no way. I believe that physical attraction is important because if I'm not attracted, it wouldn't work, but for me, a good face is more than enough (I mention this as it will be relevant later on).

Just over a month later, in February of this year, my friend sent me a picture of him (it was his WhatsApp profile picture) lifting weights, and she wrote, ""Hey, remember my cool friend? the one you called, and he said no? It's him."" In that photo, his face wasn't fully visible as he was wearing a mask, but he looked strong and healthy. I replied, "" :o , don't you have more pictures to see his face?"" And she sent me a picture from his Facebook profile, where an attractive young man with Asian features could be seen. I liked him physically, and I told her, ""He's handsome; if you want, introduce us. I like him physically, and I also liked his attitude."" I asked her to describe his personality, and she sent me a 4-minute audio, but I didn't reply as I was busy with other things. One thing I forgot to mention is that I wanted her to introduce us in person because I don't believe in love over the internet, and I thought we might idealize each other prematurely (and now I regret not mentioning this earlier).  
  
Two days pass, and she tells me, ""Hey, friend, Pedro asked me to give you his number,"" and I'm like, ""WHAAAAT, WHY DID YOU TELL HIM?"" I asked her what had happened, and she said she told Pedro, ""I mentioned that I have a friend who found you cool, showed him some pictures of you, and he asked for your number."" I was surprised. Then she sends me some photos of him, and he looked very handsome in them.  


Then she mentioned that they were on a video call, working on their thesis, and asked if I wanted to join. Without hesitation, I put on my headset and connected to meet and talk with him. I should mention that I had my camera turned on, but he didn't. We chatted about MBTI, preferences, and other topics. I really liked him (I should also mention that during that video call, he didn't know I was the one who played the prank on him; he found out days later, and he took it with humor again). There was a part of the conversation where I asked him how long he had been single, and he responded, ""Around two years"" (this detail is also important). It was a coincidence because my last relationship had also ended in 2021. It was a long story, but I don't want to go into too much detail. That person, whom we'll call Emilio, was very important in my life as he was my first in many aspects, and the time I spent with him was intense.

Going back to the topic, I asked about his ex-partners because I'm interested in knowing if he has healed from past wounds or how his relationships with his ex-girlfriends were. My breakup with Emilio was relatively rough, more than that, it was very sad for me. Throughout 2022, I had a broken heart.

Weeks passed, and I was eager to meet Pedro in person, but there was an important detail: he didn't want me to see him because he felt very insecure about his physical appearance. He was overweight and didn't look like the photos he sent me. He told me this himself, which was the reason he never turned on his camera during our video calls. He always said, ""Honestly, I'd prefer you to see me in person."" I tolerated it, but it seemed very suspicious to me.

One day, he turned on the camera, and in reality, he looked nothing like the photos he had sent. I found out from María that he had started going to the gym to ""be at my level"" because he thought I was really beautiful and wanted to see me on a specific date. I tolerate it, because at the end of the day, he can lose weight and will be attractive again, what I liked about him was his personality, that was the reason I became attracted to him: his sense of humor.

During this time, throughout March, we would talk, and he was very affectionate towards me. There was one occasion where he surprised me by sending a red dress to my house along with some Japanese sushi. He also wrote me a letter expressing that he would do everything possible to make our connection flourish. This made me believe that he was serious about our relationship, as his actions matched his words. The fact that he paid attention to details like knowing I loved dresses and even asked me which one I liked the most before buying it made me appreciate him even more.

One week after the situation with the dress, we finally met in person. It was María, Pedro, and me. As soon as I saw Pedro, I hugged him. It was a perfect moment because right at that time, a motorcyclist passed by saw us, and shouted, ""That's love!"" It was... perfect, and I had become infatuated with him. To provide more detail, I saw him in person for the first time on March 18th. The whole day was beautiful and he sent me a message telling me ""I'm very in love with you.""

On March 20th, my classes at the university began, and I needed to buy a book that was only available in a specific district near his house. I wanted to surprise and visit him, so I called him and told him I was going to do something crazy and come near his place to hug him. I took a taxi, got off near his house, and messaged him to ""turn around"" on his phone. Then, I ran to hug him. That day was wonderful; I hadn't planned anything sexual, not even to kiss him, but he surprised me with a kiss and asked me to be his girlfriend, to which I said yes because I was deeply in love. It might have been too soon, as we had only known each other for a month, literally, but I was very happy.

The problems started when, just 5 days after we started the relationship, he called me, sounding worried, and said that his ex had messaged him, telling him that he deserved that she cheated on him (before that call, he had mentioned this to my best friend, María, and she advised him to tell me the truth). I asked him when was the last time they had spoken, and he said it was **in August 2022**, which didn't add up for me because the dates didn't match. He had previously told me that he had been single for two years and had blocked his ex, which didn't make sense. To give you some context, on the same day his ex sent that message, he tagged me in a comment on a movie theater's Facebook page. He made us believe, María and me, that maybe his ex saw that comment, found out about me, and he was scared that she might message me ""telling lies.""

It's worth mentioning that before all this happened (around the beginning of March), I had expressed to him that I felt ""angry"" and ""unfair"" about how, when he was in good physical shape, he had more time for his exes. It frustrated me because my university classes were starting soon, and I wouldn't have as much time to spend with him. He claimed to understand my frustration. However, what raised my suspicions about his lies was that he told me he was overweight during his last relationship with his ex (the one who sent him the message). This didn't match because if they had broken up two years ago (in 2021), he was slim (I had seen his pictures and confirmed the dates). That's why I was suspecting he was lying to me.

The point is that, at that moment, I let it go, and I thanked him for trusting me enough to tell me about the message from his ex. The following days were normal. However, a week later, I started to have a strange feeling. Something told me he was lying to me about his ex's message. He mentioned his family and friends not knowing her, never bringing her to his house, etc.

Almost every time I visited his house (about 98% of the time), I would leave feeling upset, and he could notice my change in mood through our messages.  
  
During a call, we were discussing what bothered us about each other, and I mentioned that his lack of firmness upset me because if he had blocked his ex before, she wouldn't have sent that message, and we would have avoided so many arguments. In response, he said, ""You know what, the next time you come to my house, let me borrow your phone, and I'll block those people."" The day I saw him again, he took my phone and blocked his ex, whom we'll call Paula, and his sister.

Curiosity got the best of me, and I looked up the names of those girls on TikTok. I sent him a message with a screenshot of Paula's sister profile, asking, ""Do you know the girl from this profile?"" he replied, ""Yes, she's the sister of the one who sent me that message.""  
  
I looked at both girls' profiles on TikTok and found a video where Paula said, ""Where a lioness steps, a little cat can't erase the footprint."" The video was from January, and seeing that, I thought she had that kind of mindset and didn't want to see him happy with someone else. I sent him a message, forwarding that TikTok, and said, ""Now I know, this is the answer to all my questions."" Then, he called me, asking me to please block her, remove her from my life, and not check her profile. He spoke very poorly of Paula, saying she was nobody because she didn't have an education, she was a single mother, and she had a ""messy life"" (she liked going to clubs). The topic ended there.

As I mentioned before, I always left his house feeling upset because I had this gut feeling that he was lying to me. Throughout the relationship, I never told him about my suspicions (I didn't want him to be upset about that topic again), but my silence obviously annoyed him. I understand it must have been uncomfortable for him to see me angry without knowing the reason behind it. I take responsibility for the lack of communication on my part, which harmed the relationship.  
  
Throughout the relationship, I didn't feel like my feelings were reciprocated. I was the one who visited him, and we split the expenses 50/50. On one hand, I didn't want him to pick me up from the university, mainly due to the distance (and I think it would be inconvenient for him due to his job nature), and I liked the district where he lived.

What made me end the relationship was that one day I visited him, and he preferred to play video games instead of spending time with me, considering that we only saw each other once a week. After that, I literally gathered my things and left. In the evening, I messaged him saying I didn't want to be in the relationship anymore. He said, ""It was nice while it lasted,"" but then he spoke badly of me, calling me insecure, overly jealous, saying that people with ""daddy issues"" repeat patterns, among other things. It was very offensive, and he expressed himself poorly. I never spoke badly about himself and never used things that hurt him, like his appearance, to offend him. What he did was honestly very low.

That night, I started drinking, and the next day, I decided to message that girl, Paula, to ask her about him. At first, she spoke well of him, but when I told her about my situation, especially regarding the message, she denied everything and said she didn't even know I existed. She mentioned that she had messaged him saying that ""he deserved it"" (she didn't cheat on him, but she felt sorry that she couldn't reciprocate with him during the relationship and she said that  he deserved not being reciprocated) because she found messages between him and her sister, and that had upset her a lot. She then revealed that their relationship had not been two years ago (in 2021), as he had told me during our first video call, but it had actually been recent, in 2022, and they had broken up in October last year.  
  
Paula also told me that in March of this year (around the time he was flirting with me and saying he wanted something serious with me), while his whole family was on a trip, he invited her to his house mainly because he wanted to have sex. This had happened during and outside their relationship, and he used to take her to his house alone when his family wasn't there. What's worse is that Paula had asked him at that time, ""Hey, are you dating someone?"" and he had said ""no"".   
  
He had told me that he didn't bring her to his house because she didn't have an education, was a single mother, and other reasons. He claimed that the Japanese value work and someone like her wouldn't be well-received, etc.  
  
A few days after he broke up with me (we broke up at the end of May 2023), he unblocked her and messaged her again, saying, ""Hey, what did you write?"" and mentioned me but not as his partner, just as someone he was ""seeing, and it didn't work out."" Ironically, he admitted to being immature and not telling the truth to Paula (I mean, admitting he lied to me). Initially, when Paula told me that Pedro had asked her to come to his house because his whole family went on a trip, I gave him the benefit of the doubt, as she could have easily found out about his family being away through his sister's influencer stories.  
  
I decided to meet with this girl Paula, and we talked. She let me see all their messages, and some of them broke my heart. Honestly, I have mixed feelings about it. He ended things with me, and within days, he was reaching out to his ex, talking about me and telling her, ""As a couple, we didn't work out, but you're a cool person."" During our conversation, Paula mentioned that her relationship with him was very different from what he had with me. He didn't make her pay 50/50; he would bring her food and be more attentive, among other things.  
He was desperate to see her and wanted to drink with her. The following Saturday, exactly one week after he last saw me (when we broke up, the day I packed my things and left his house), they met up. What he didn't know was that both of us had decided to confront him and remove him definitively from our lives.

It's important to note that she also told me she was embarrassed by him because of the facial expressions he made, and that's why she didn't introduce him to her family or friends. I acknowledge that it was something that also embarrassed me about him, but I let it go because I still loved him, and it was something I could tolerate.  
  
On the day of the encounter, I was quite nervous. She had sent me her real-time location, and unfortunately, I got delayed due to traffic, but I eventually arrived. I ran to the park, and as soon as he saw me, he said, ""Ah, I knew this was going to happen,"" that's when everything began. I told him, ""I know everything, I read everything, she knows everything too."" I was very nervous, almost trembling, and he noticed that. He tried to touch my hand, and I exclaimed, ""DON'T TOUCH ME!"" He admitted to lying to me, and it was all very painful.  
  
In the end, he said, ""Why are you doing this? Just to hurt yourself more and disappoint yourself."" ""This ended very badly."" I told him, ""This is the last time you see me, goodbye,"" and I left the park with Paula.

Upon arriving home, Paula tells me he wrote to her asking for forgiveness, admitting he made a mistake. She mentioned that she's not resentful, and since he didn't involve her daughter, she doesn't hold any grudges, etc. In short, much later, she tells me, ""I removed him from my life as a partner, but I still want him as a friend because that outing was very enjoyable,"" and that they might meet again to have ice cream. This made me very angry because, in essence, he still wins, as if he won't learn his lesson. He may not have me, but he has his ex in his life.  
  
Another detail I didn't mention is that Pedro has a business, and my best friend, Maria, helps him with sales. That day they had a virtual meeting, and they inevitably ended up discussing what happened on the night of June 3rd. Maria tells me that he admitted to being terrible for deceiving me and having lied, and that he ""wanted to feel the love of two women.""  
  
I was deeply affected by all of this. Why did he lie to me so much? He lied before, during, and after the relationship. He spoke poorly of her, and in the end, he seeks her again. I recognize that I'm jealous and sometimes insecure, but I cared about him a lot, and I still do despite all this. I also acknowledge my responsibility for never telling him that I suspected he was lying and just leaving his house angrily without giving any explanation.

A week later, after Paula told me she was still going to see him, I made the mistake of writing and calling Pedro (I thought he had blocked me). He answered and said he wanted to leave all of this behind, that it's over and I've already marked him, etc. I confronted him, expressing my hurt and how unfair it all seemed to me, and I was angry that he never apologized. He replied that it wasn't the right moment to apologize but now he recognized that he had hurt me and asked for forgiveness.  
  
I also expressed my anger that he got his way in the end, losing me but still having Paula, even if it's just as a friend. He said, ""Things won't go the way you want,"" and he's right, but it doesn't make it any less unfair. He also mentioned that he burned the printed photo we had together as it was ""symbolic."" That call took place between June 11th and 12th, and it was the last time I heard his voice.  
  
On June 14th, I sent him an extensive 6-page letter expressing all my feelings, how his lies affected me, from saying he was single for two years to denying he had ever taken her to his house. In that letter, I also apologized because he felt I judged him a lot for his past and for being jealous and leaving his house angrily without giving an explanation.  
  
All of this makes me distrustful even more. I'm afraid of falling in love again. This whole situation feels unfair and makes me angry. I don't deserve to be lied to, and I hate how much I overthink about his ex. There's not a day after all this that I don't think about what happened on that June 3rd. He seemed so calm in that last call, as if everything I did for him meant nothing, like promoting his business or taking time out of my tight schedule to visit him.

I still love him, I love him very much. And while it's true that I have every right to feel resentful towards him for what he did to me, I try to understand him. As I mentioned before, he has felt insecure about his physical appearance for most of his life until he lost weight and had a glow-up in 2020. When he was in good physical shape, he decided to start dating, have a profile on Facebook Dating (that's how he met Paula) etc. He was in good shape until the beginning of 2022 when the stress of his business and thesis made him neglect his physical health. Taking into consideration that we all need love in some way and his physical appearance make him more attractive and get attention from girls.  
  
Sometimes, I think he kept seeing Paula because she had accepted him when he was overweight, and maybe he wanted to have her as a backup in case I rejected him (?). That's why he told my best friend that he wanted to ""feel loved by two women."" His physical appearance didn't matter much to me, even less now; I love him for who he was, so fun with his sense of humor and wit.

I also confess that sometimes I feel the urge to seek revenge and tell his mother everything her son has done (he never introduced me as his girlfriend, but from the numerous times I went to his house and the gifts I gave him (a ballon with a form of a heart) and stayed overnight, she inferred it).  
  
I often visit his business page, and sometimes check Paula's profile (I told him I would block her because I didn't want to see her status updates on WhatsApp if she was going out with Pedro).  
  
All of this makes me lose my emotional stability; I wish to write to him to let him know that I understand, but I also know that I deserve something better and a more beautiful love.  
  
I would like to write to him one last time to ask him to delete the comments he tagged me in on Facebook, so there won't be any trace that I ever existed in his life (I forgot to mention that at least on social media, he did post about me, which he didn't do with Paula because he may have felt embarrased for her for the reasons mentioned earlier).  
  
I have mixed feelings, and I know I need to move on, but it's difficult for me.  
  
Any advice or words are welcome as long as they're not offensive.  
  
Thank you for reading this.","I shouldn't have called twice to that number... now I can't get all that happened out of my mind This story is quite long and with many details to take into account, but I'll try to be as brief as possible.

Two days pass, and she tells me, ""Hey, friend, Pedro asked me to give you his number,"" and I'm like, ""WHAAAAT, WHY DID YOU TELL HIM?"" I asked her what had happened, and she said she told Pedro, ""I mentioned that I have a friend who found you cool, showed him some pictures of you, and he asked for your number."" I was surprised. Then she sends me some photos of him, and he looked very handsome in them.  


Then she mentioned that they were on a video call, working on their thesis, and asked if I wanted to join. Without hesitation, I put on my headset and connected to meet and talk with him. I should mention that I had my camera turned on, but he didn't. We chatted about MBTI, preferences, and other topics. I really liked him (I should also mention that during that video call, he didn't know I was the one who played the prank on him; he found out days later, and he took it with humor again). There was a part of the conversation where I asked him how long he had been single, and he responded, ""Around two years"" (this detail is also important). It was a coincidence because my last relationship had also ended in 2021. It was a long story, but I don't want to go into too much detail. That person, whom we'll call Emilio, was very important in my life as he was my first in many aspects, and the time I spent with him was intense.

Going back to the topic, I asked about his ex-partners because I'm interested in knowing if he has healed from past wounds or how his relationships with his ex-girlfriends were. My breakup with Emilio was relatively rough, more than that, it was very sad for me. Throughout 2022, I had a broken heart.

Weeks passed, and I was eager to meet Pedro in person, but there was an important detail: he didn't want me to see him because he felt very insecure about his physical appearance. He was overweight and didn't look like the photos he sent me. He told me this himself, which was the reason he never turned on his camera during our video calls. He always said, ""Honestly, I'd prefer you to see me in person."" I tolerated it, but it seemed very suspicious to me.

One day, he turned on the camera, and in reality, he looked nothing like the photos he had sent. I found out from María that he had started going to the gym to ""be at my level"" because he thought I was really beautiful and wanted to see me on a specific date. I tolerate it, because at the end of the day, he can lose weight and will be attractive again, what I liked about him was his personality, that was the reason I became attracted to him: his sense of humor.

During this time, throughout March, we would talk, and he was very affectionate towards me. There was one occasion where he surprised me by sending a red dress to my house along with some Japanese sushi. He also wrote me a letter expressing that he would do everything possible to make our connection flourish. This made me believe that he was serious about our relationship, as his actions matched his words. The fact that he paid attention to details like knowing I loved dresses and even asked me which one I liked the most before buying it made me appreciate him even more.

One week after the situation with the dress, we finally met in person. It was María, Pedro, and me. As soon as I saw Pedro, I hugged him. It was a perfect moment because right at that time, a motorcyclist passed by saw us, and shouted, ""That's love!"" It was... perfect, and I had become infatuated with him. To provide more detail, I saw him in person for the first time on March 18th. The whole day was beautiful and he sent me a message telling me ""I'm very in love with you.""

On March 20th, my classes at the university began, and I needed to buy a book that was only available in a specific district near his house. I wanted to surprise and visit him, so I called him and told him I was going to do something crazy and come near his place to hug him. I took a taxi, got off near his house, and messaged him to ""turn around"" on his phone. Then, I ran to hug him. That day was wonderful; I hadn't planned anything sexual, not even to kiss him, but he surprised me with a kiss and asked me to be his girlfriend, to which I said yes because I was deeply in love. It might have been too soon, as we had only known each other for a month, literally, but I was very happy.

The problems started when, just 5 days after we started the relationship, he called me, sounding worried, and said that his ex had messaged him, telling him that he deserved that she cheated on him (before that call, he had mentioned this to my best friend, María, and she advised him to tell me the truth). I asked him when was the last time they had spoken, and he said it was **in August 2022**, which didn't add up for me because the dates didn't match. He had previously told me that he had been single for two years and had blocked his ex, which didn't make sense. To give you some context, on the same day his ex sent that message, he tagged me in a comment on a movie theater's Facebook page. He made us believe, María and me, that maybe his ex saw that comment, found out about me, and he was scared that she might message me ""telling lies.""

It's worth mentioning that before all this happened (around the beginning of March), I had expressed to him that I felt ""angry"" and ""unfair"" about how, when he was in good physical shape, he had more time for his exes. It frustrated me because my university classes were starting soon, and I wouldn't have as much time to spend with him. He claimed to understand my frustration. However, what raised my suspicions about his lies was that he told me he was overweight during his last relationship with his ex (the one who sent him the message). This didn't match because if they had broken up two years ago (in 2021), he was slim (I had seen his pictures and confirmed the dates). That's why I was suspecting he was lying to me.

The point is that, at that moment, I let it go, and I thanked him for trusting me enough to tell me about the message from his ex. The following days were normal. However, a week later, I started to have a strange feeling. Something told me he was lying to me about his ex's message. He mentioned his family and friends not knowing her, never bringing her to his house, etc.

Almost every time I visited his house (about 98% of the time), I would leave feeling upset, and he could notice my change in mood through our messages.  
  
During a call, we were discussing what bothered us about each other, and I mentioned that his lack of firmness upset me because if he had blocked his ex before, she wouldn't have sent that message, and we would have avoided so many arguments. In response, he said, ""You know what, the next time you come to my house, let me borrow your phone, and I'll block those people."" The day I saw him again, he took my phone and blocked his ex, whom we'll call Paula, and his sister.

Curiosity got the best of me, and I looked up the names of those girls on TikTok. I sent him a message with a screenshot of Paula's sister profile, asking, ""Do you know the girl from this profile?"" he replied, ""Yes, she's the sister of the one who sent me that message.""  
  
I looked at both girls' profiles on TikTok and found a video where Paula said, ""Where a lioness steps, a little cat can't erase the footprint."" The video was from January, and seeing that, I thought she had that kind of mindset and didn't want to see him happy with someone else. I sent him a message, forwarding that TikTok, and said, ""Now I know, this is the answer to all my questions."" Then, he called me, asking me to please block her, remove her from my life, and not check her profile. He spoke very poorly of Paula, saying she was nobody because she didn't have an education, she was a single mother, and she had a ""messy life"" (she liked going to clubs). The topic ended there.

As I mentioned before, I always left his house feeling upset because I had this gut feeling that he was lying to me. Throughout the relationship, I never told him about my suspicions (I didn't want him to be upset about that topic again), but my silence obviously annoyed him. I understand it must have been uncomfortable for him to see me angry without knowing the reason behind it. I take responsibility for the lack of communication on my part, which harmed the relationship.  
  
Throughout the relationship, I didn't feel like my feelings were reciprocated. I was the one who visited him, and we split the expenses 50/50. On one hand, I didn't want him to pick me up from the university, mainly due to the distance (and I think it would be inconvenient for him due to his job nature), and I liked the district where he lived.

What made me end the relationship was that one day I visited him, and he preferred to play video games instead of spending time with me, considering that we only saw each other once a week. After that, I literally gathered my things and left. In the evening, I messaged him saying I didn't want to be in the relationship anymore. He said, ""It was nice while it lasted,"" but then he spoke badly of me, calling me insecure, overly jealous, saying that people with ""daddy issues"" repeat patterns, among other things. It was very offensive, and he expressed himself poorly. I never spoke badly about himself and never used things that hurt him, like his appearance, to offend him. What he did was honestly very low.

That night, I started drinking, and the next day, I decided to message that girl, Paula, to ask her about him. At first, she spoke well of him, but when I told her about my situation, especially regarding the message, she denied everything and said she didn't even know I existed. She mentioned that she had messaged him saying that ""he deserved it"" (she didn't cheat on him, but she felt sorry that she couldn't reciprocate with him during the relationship and she said that  he deserved not being reciprocated) because she found messages between him and her sister, and that had upset her a lot. She then revealed that their relationship had not been two years ago (in 2021), as he had told me during our first video call, but it had actually been recent, in 2022, and they had broken up in October last year.  
  
Paula also told me that in March of this year (around the time he was flirting with me and saying he wanted something serious with me), while his whole family was on a trip, he invited her to his house mainly because he wanted to have sex. This had happened during and outside their relationship, and he used to take her to his house alone when his family wasn't there. What's worse is that Paula had asked him at that time, ""Hey, are you dating someone?"" and he had said ""no"".   
  
He had told me that he didn't bring her to his house because she didn't have an education, was a single mother, and other reasons. He claimed that the Japanese value work and someone like her wouldn't be well-received, etc.  
  
A few days after he broke up with me (we broke up at the end of May 2023), he unblocked her and messaged her again, saying, ""Hey, what did you write?"" and mentioned me but not as his partner, just as someone he was ""seeing, and it didn't work out."" Ironically, he admitted to being immature and not telling the truth to Paula (I mean, admitting he lied to me). Initially, when Paula told me that Pedro had asked her to come to his house because his whole family went on a trip, I gave him the benefit of the doubt, as she could have easily found out about his family being away through his sister's influencer stories.  
  
I decided to meet with this girl Paula, and we talked. She let me see all their messages, and some of them broke my heart. Honestly, I have mixed feelings about it. He ended things with me, and within days, he was reaching out to his ex, talking about me and telling her, ""As a couple, we didn't work out, but you're a cool person."" During our conversation, Paula mentioned that her relationship with him was very different from what he had with me. He didn't make her pay 50/50; he would bring her food and be more attentive, among other things.  
He was desperate to see her and wanted to drink with her. The following Saturday, exactly one week after he last saw me (when we broke up, the day I packed my things and left his house), they met up. What he didn't know was that both of us had decided to confront him and remove him definitively from our lives.

It's important to note that she also told me she was embarrassed by him because of the facial expressions he made, and that's why she didn't introduce him to her family or friends. I acknowledge that it was something that also embarrassed me about him, but I let it go because I still loved him, and it was something I could tolerate.  
  
On the day of the encounter, I was quite nervous. She had sent me her real-time location, and unfortunately, I got delayed due to traffic, but I eventually arrived. I ran to the park, and as soon as he saw me, he said, ""Ah, I knew this was going to happen,"" that's when everything began. I told him, ""I know everything, I read everything, she knows everything too."" I was very nervous, almost trembling, and he noticed that. He tried to touch my hand, and I exclaimed, ""DON'T TOUCH ME!"" He admitted to lying to me, and it was all very painful.  
  
In the end, he said, ""Why are you doing this? Just to hurt yourself more and disappoint yourself."" ""This ended very badly."" I told him, ""This is the last time you see me, goodbye,"" and I left the park with Paula.

Upon arriving home, Paula tells me he wrote to her asking for forgiveness, admitting he made a mistake. She mentioned that she's not resentful, and since he didn't involve her daughter, she doesn't hold any grudges, etc. In short, much later, she tells me, ""I removed him from my life as a partner, but I still want him as a friend because that outing was very enjoyable,"" and that they might meet again to have ice cream. This made me very angry because, in essence, he still wins, as if he won't learn his lesson. He may not have me, but he has his ex in his life.  
  
Another detail I didn't mention is that Pedro has a business, and my best friend, Maria, helps him with sales. That day they had a virtual meeting, and they inevitably ended up discussing what happened on the night of June 3rd. Maria tells me that he admitted to being terrible for deceiving me and having lied, and that he ""wanted to feel the love of two women.""  
  
I was deeply affected by all of this. Why did he lie to me so much? He lied before, during, and after the relationship. He spoke poorly of her, and in the end, he seeks her again. I recognize that I'm jealous and sometimes insecure, but I cared about him a lot, and I still do despite all this. I also acknowledge my responsibility for never telling him that I suspected he was lying and just leaving his house angrily without giving any explanation.

A week later, after Paula told me she was still going to see him, I made the mistake of writing and calling Pedro (I thought he had blocked me). He answered and said he wanted to leave all of this behind, that it's over and I've already marked him, etc. I confronted him, expressing my hurt and how unfair it all seemed to me, and I was angry that he never apologized. He replied that it wasn't the right moment to apologize but now he recognized that he had hurt me and asked for forgiveness.  
  
I also expressed my anger that he got his way in the end, losing me but still having Paula, even if it's just as a friend. He said, ""Things won't go the way you want,"" and he's right, but it doesn't make it any less unfair. He also mentioned that he burned the printed photo we had together as it was ""symbolic."" That call took place between June 11th and 12th, and it was the last time I heard his voice.  
  
On June 14th, I sent him an extensive 6-page letter expressing all my feelings, how his lies affected me, from saying he was single for two years to denying he had ever taken her to his house. In that letter, I also apologized because he felt I judged him a lot for his past and for being jealous and leaving his house angrily without giving an explanation.  
  
All of this makes me distrustful even more. I'm afraid of falling in love again. This whole situation feels unfair and makes me angry. I don't deserve to be lied to, and I hate how much I overthink about his ex. There's not a day after all this that I don't think about what happened on that June 3rd. He seemed so calm in that last call, as if everything I did for him meant nothing, like promoting his business or taking time out of my tight schedule to visit him.

I still love him, I love him very much. And while it's true that I have every right to feel resentful towards him for what he did to me, I try to understand him. As I mentioned before, he has felt insecure about his physical appearance for most of his life until he lost weight and had a glow-up in 2020. When he was in good physical shape, he decided to start dating, have a profile on Facebook Dating (that's how he met Paula) etc. He was in good shape until the beginning of 2022 when the stress of his business and thesis made him neglect his physical health. Taking into consideration that we all need love in some way and his physical appearance make him more attractive and get attention from girls.  
  
Sometimes, I think he kept seeing Paula because she had accepted him when he was overweight, and maybe he wanted to have her as a backup in case I rejected him (?). That's why he told my best friend that he wanted to ""feel loved by two women."" His physical appearance didn't matter much to me, even less now; I love him for who he was, so fun with his sense of humor and wit.

I also confess that sometimes I feel the urge to seek revenge and tell his mother everything her son has done (he never introduced me as his girlfriend, but from the numerous times I went to his house and the gifts I gave him (a ballon with a form of a heart) and stayed overnight, she inferred it).  
  
I often visit his business page, and sometimes check Paula's profile (I told him I would block her because I didn't want to see her status updates on WhatsApp if she was going out with Pedro).  
  
All of this makes me lose my emotional stability; I wish to write to him to let him know that I understand, but I also know that I deserve something better and a more beautiful love.  
  
I would like to write to him one last time to ask him to delete the comments he tagged me in on Facebook, so there won't be any trace that I ever existed in his life (I forgot to mention that at least on social media, he did post about me, which he didn't do with Paula because he may have felt embarrased for her for the reasons mentioned earlier).  
  
I have mixed feelings, and I know I need to move on, but it's difficult for me.  
  
Any advice or words are welcome as long as they're not offensive.

18315,14oz5yv,post,I realized that most of my closest friends are some bad people.,"TW: Sex offender

I have 12 really close friends, we hang out together since we are 5yo for most of us (we're 20 now) and we met 4 of those friends when we were 11.

We have always been really different and that's what made our strenght, most of the people couldn't understand why we were together, I can't really explain it but we've always respected other's differences and make jokes about everyone. But lately I felt that I was too different from the others we still have the same humor but it's just about politics and stuff...

One of the thing that really made us closer took place when we were 15, basically one of our friends has been accused of rape, and we decided to support the victims against him. But that's also this event that made me think today that maybe I'm not like them.

We were talking about it few days ago because my best friend today is the first victim, and while we were talking i realized that most of them kicked him out of our friend group, because they just didn't liked him in the first place it has nothing to do with what he did.

We had our first big argument and i heard some things like ""You know most of the accusations are false""... ""they do it for attention""... ""some of them sctually like to be rape"" they always had this kind of talk but i've always thought that it was some bad jokes i realized that they were actually serious all this time.  

During those years they made some ""jokes"" about how they hate LGBT community, while my actual gf is Bisexual and my brother is gay it makes me feel uncomfortable to think that they were serious about that too.

It could sound weird to think that they were joking but it's my humor. We've always made those jokes but to laugh about those who are actually saying this seriously, just for laughing about how dumb those people actually are. So i've never think that some of them could actually be serious while saying those things.

I really want to take my distances with them, but some of them really are some good people and i'm scared to lose them because everytime this kind of things happened in our group it's always the guy alone who ends alone.","I realized that most of my closest friends are some bad people.

I have 12 really close friends, we hang out together since we are 5yo for most of us (we're 20 now) and we met 4 of those friends when we were 11.

We have always been really different and that's what made our strenght, most of the people couldn't understand why we were together, I can't really explain it but we've always respected other's differences and make jokes about everyone. But lately I felt that I was too different from the others we still have the same humor but it's just about politics and stuff...

One of the thing that really made us closer took place when we were 15, basically one of our friends has been accused of rape, and we decided to support the victims against him. But that's also this event that made me think today that maybe I'm not like them.

We were talking about it few days ago because my best friend today is the first victim, and while we were talking i realized that most of them kicked him out of our friend group, because they just didn't liked him in the first place it has nothing to do with what he did.

We had our first big argument and i heard some things like ""You know most of the accusations are false""... ""they do it for attention""... ""some of them sctually like to be rape"" they always had this kind of talk but i've always thought that it was some bad jokes i realized that they were actually serious all this time.  

During those years they made some ""jokes"" about how they hate LGBT community, while my actual gf is Bisexual and my brother is gay it makes me feel uncomfortable to think that they were serious about that too.

It could sound weird to think that they were joking but it's my humor. We've always made those jokes but to laugh about those who are actually saying this seriously, just for laughing about how dumb those people actually are. So i've never think that some of them could actually be serious while saying those things.

I really want to take my distances with them, but some of them really are some good people and i'm scared to lose them because everytime this kind of things happened in our group it's always the guy alone who ends alone.",2,1,2023-07-02 21:02,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/14oz5yv/i_realized_that_most_of_my_closest_friends_are/,Neutral

18317,148b02q,post,One of My Best Friends Broke My Heart,"Ok here it goes. So I met my friend (I will call him Ben), Ben, through another person who we both discovered simultaneously was kind of a snake in the grass, thus, we ended that friendship, but in the process, we became really good friends like overnight. Consequently, we started hanging out quite a bit, and at times, I felt like maybe I was getting some sexual vibes from him.  All the while, he would do more comfortably acceptable things like pull out his fake vagina and talk a brief moment about how he is experimenting with it.  If I remember, I responded by saying something like oh that looks really interesting, and he responded (I remember this 100%) by saying I can clean really well if you want to try it. Hmmm... I didn't respond but my heart started pounding rather quickly. So we were just becoming closer and closer and everything was awesome. So one night we were at my place, and out of the blue, he  comes over to sit closer to me on the couch and says, ""so what is it like to cum while have anal sex"". I said well, in my opinion, it makes cumming better.  I enjoy it a lot.  And it really didn't go anywhere after that. Then another time he mentioned that he bought a dildo to see if he was gay. Then another he told me he met up with a trans sexual on a dating sight but that they didn't do anything. So this is when I realized I was developing feelings for him, because I became almost offended that he was telling me this and it wasn't me. Then my head just started spinning and I told him that it made me kind of jealous.  Well so not too long after this, I told him I had feelings for him, and at first, he said he didn't want to ruin our friendship by having sex.  But then he just started completely ignoring all of my calls and texts, so then I became so hurt.  I then started just sending him a lot of messages mostly saying why won't you answer any of my messages when you know how much it's hurting my feelings. So I get this sudden message from him and it says, ""I'm not fucking gay, and all I can offer you right now is friendship"". I told him he was the one who had thrown had some shit to make me feel this way to which he replied nothing at all. So I was so hurt and I was depressed and sad, and at one point, I came to the conclusion that he was just selfish and that he really didn't give 2 shits about my feelings. So I told him I wanted to end the friendship. So I started missing him after about 2 weeks, and I also felt like I maybe overreacted.  Lol So he had blocked me, so I sent him really heartfelt message apologizing and only focusing on our friendship on my free texting acct. He told me he missed me a lot and we have been hanging out here and there but it's more distant and I'm still hurt.  I feel like he trampled all over my feelings and never took responsibility for his own actions.  Well actually he never even so much as owned up to what he had said all those times let alone apologized on any level. So I'm left now currently feeling a bit jaded and not really knowing or feeling comfortable with how to move forward or how to deal with my feelings regarding all of this.

18318,147pj7y,post,"My non-binary partner made me realise that non-binary, is language based nonsense","Out of respect for the non-binary community I'm gonna use they/them pronouns for my ex. 

So, I was completely for people being non-binary, supported it for years, my whole life really. Personal freedom is important! 

I supported it so much I was quite excited to date someone who was non-binary, learn more about it sort of thing. First date was very good, it was going great for a few months, no arguing, sex was good, everything was fun, had a lot in common. 

One day they asked about a 3some, they wanted me and on the same night one of they're female friends too, so we talked about their bisexuality for a bit. I thought the whole idea was hot tbh, I've never had a 3some before. 

But then they told me, mid conversation, I had to be bisexual also? Huh? I said I've only ever dated women, I only want to date women, I told my partner, I'm dating you because you have a vagina, tits, beautiful looks. I respect you being non-binary and will always support that identity, but when it comes to sex, ie sexuality, I'm with you for your vagina. 

We talked about it more and eventually I said dude. I'm not forcing you to be straight, you ask for my cock every night and yet, I'm still letting you be a non-binary bisexual person. 

So let me be what I want to be. A straight man. 

But they were not having this! They said if I was straight, it meant that it clashed with their identity, they told me we couldn't be together if I was straight. 

-_- 

Again, I never made them change their labels, I always let them use whatever labels they wanted to. 

But I had to break up with them because it felt controlling, I couldn't call myself straight anymore?

It was madness to me, I regretted the whole thing, I was thinking, I shouldn't of ever dated you. 

Keep in mind my partner had diagnosed PTSD, regular disassociation, abuse from parents at a young age, I don't want to go into detail, out of respect. But tbh, I think this trauma is actually where the non-binary belief was stemming from. 

So yea I don't believe in non-binary anymore, it was just used as a power play against me. 

Sad thing is before we dated they hated their breasts, I mean REALLY hated their own breasts. I loved their body of course and over time I made them a lot more comfortable with having breasts, they liked their breasts and didn't hate them anymore. I think that was a positive? 

I made them like their own body more. Body positivity is good right? I think that's one good thing from the whole experience. 

I'm gonna be honest with you all, I look back sometimes, and I see a young woman massively struggling with her identity, they were chronically online though so they fell down this hole. They tried to change my identity to make themselves more comfortable, and that was a power play I had to say no to. 

Sorry if I offended anyone I hope I haven't, but please disagree or agree with me in the comments so I can get some perspective.","My non-binary partner made me realise that non-binary, is language based nonsense Out of respect for the non-binary community I'm gonna use they/them pronouns for my ex.

18319,1474dfv,post,Going through waves of guilt and hoping I did the right thing by calling CPS. TW: multiple types of abuse.,"I have 2 nephews 14 and 16. The 16 year old has a learning disability and is a bit slower. My mother has custody of them. My sister is on drugs and gave my mom custody when they were 6 and 8. Their father is a sex offender and offended against children so they can't be around him. (Solicited nudes from a 12 year old girl.)

My brother is 36 and lives with my mom with no job, does no chores, and basically acts at my mother's muscles when the boys get in trouble. When he isn't yelling at and disciplining the boys, he's in his room playing videogames. He doesn't contribute any other way. Some forms of discipline are yelling, grounding, spanking, etc. He started smoking weed with the boys when they were 12 and 14. CPS was called at the time but CPS questioned my nephews in front of my brother and mother so they lied and closed the case that day. 

My nephews started staying with us on and off at the beginning at the summer and has had to go home from time time. On the car rides home, I noticed they get fidgity, bite their nails, rubbing their hair, and exhibiting self soothing gestures in general. I notice they end up in trouble and grounded within an hour of walking through the door and they can't come back for three days while they are grounded for giving my mom attitude. I haven't noticed them give her attitude outside of normal teenage frustration. An example is they came in to do a few chores. I was waiting for them to get done. She told them to do one thing and as they were doing it she kept telling them to do other things  and yelling at them for not doing the next thing or yelling at them for not completing the first and it frustrated them and asked ""What do you want us to do?!"" I'm an adult and I know I couldn't figure out which thing she wanted them to do and which she wanted to do first. I would have responded in a similar way. Not liking them giving her attitude, she grounded them for three days. 

I recognize that that isn't necessarily abuse, but I feel it explains her MO. She purposely creates stressful situations then uses her power to punish them for being stressed. I've seen her do similar things then have my brother spank them. Or I've seen her push my nephews buttons like this and when they snap my brother will threaten them and say ""You talk to mom like that again and I will beat your fucking asses."" I've seen my brother get inches away from their faces. I've seen my mother get inches from the younger one's (he was 10 at the time) face and scream ""I'M GOING TO PUNCH YOU IN YOUR FUCKING FACE!!' which he ran away from and I stopped from happening. (This particular happened because the nephews were throwing a football back and forth and the football hit the older one in the face and caused his nose to bleed. The older nephew came in to ask for a tissue and help with his nose and this is how my mother reacted.) I forced her to calm down and had to hug my crying nephew because he was scared and shaking. My nephews in the last year have started learning how to fight and when asked they told me because they want to be prepared if my brother starts hitting them. They said they wanted to learn how to defend themselves and so they've been learning how to fight in private. I told foolishly told my mom this because I found it concerning and she told me they were just manipulating me and wasn't going to do anything and my brother only hit them when they were acting bad. 

I'm going to add that I really think the reason they don't know how to respectfully handle conflict because they weren't taught to. So, when they do ""give adults attitude"" it's hard to not see it as that's what they learned. They've also never given me attitude and have always respected me but I've never raised my voice to them. Even when they've stayed with me for weeks and months at a time. I have had to walk this line, because CPS has already been called and nothing happened and nothing has happened that was full on CPS worthy. Yeah, there's been abuse, but not something my state would consider abuse. (Except for the smoking weed with them, but nothing came from that.)

What lead me to finally call again, is that I had to bring them back home. They were grounded again for giving my mom attitude the day before. I dropped them off at home (told them to look into the gray rock method to help curb their reactions to her when she's purposely pushing their buttons) and went home to shower. After getting out of the shower, I got a call from my nephews saying the cops were there and I had to go get them. (I told them if my brother ever hit them, not to hit him back but to call the police then call me and that's what they did.) I showed up and found out my brother accused my nephews of doing something and started following them around and demanding them to tell the truth. (He was accusing them of stealing drugs, but I don't fully know either way if they were stealing drugs. I do feel like maybe they shouldn't have drugs in the house to begin with.)
My nephew apparently got pissed off and shouted back ""I didn't steal any fucking pills, bruh!"" and my brother told him to hit him. ""Hit me bruh. I know you want to. Just fucking do it! Go on. Hit me bruh!"" My nephew 14, tried to get away and my brother slapped him in the face twice and pushed him into a wall by the neck. The police asked me to pick up either my nephews or my brother because they felt it didn't rise to the level of abuse and later admitted they just didn't feel like arresting my brother. I agreed to take my nephews and they let my brother out of the police car.  So, I picked my nephews back up and was told to keep them for the night. My nephews both said along the lines of ""The cops just let him go? They just failed us. How did that happen?""

I called my mother to let her know what happened and I had the boys again. My mother called my brother and got his version and she came and picked my nephews up to ground them and punish them even longer. I encouraged against it, and insisted she let me stay for the night so everyone could calm down, but she wouldn't let them stay one more night at my house. About an hour and a half after she picked them up, my 14 year old nephew walked in. He had run away and refused to go back home. He said he couldn't do it anymore and was worried he would have to start walking around with a knife because he was scared my brother was going to hit him again and the cops wouldn't do anything again. I had to explain to him that I couldn't legally keep him there. I told him mom could call the cops and I could be arrested if I kept him. He also couldn't just run away because the cops would arrest him.  I told him we could call CPS if he wanted and they can start a new case, but that he would have to go home until CPS did anything. I answered the questions for all the possibilities if CPS got involved. My mother convinced him that if CPS got involved they would take him away forever and wouldn't be allowed to see us ever again. I told him that he could tell CPS to call us and they would try to put them with us first. If we weren't fit, they would go stay in a nice home and they would still be able to visit, call, and see us. I let him know all the options and gave him the choice. 

We called CPS and told them everything that I listed above as well as gave the police report from earlier in the day. We dropped him off at the corner by my mom's house and CPS met him at the door. They went to the hospital where they were drug tested and checked out and CPS made us emergency guardians that night. 

I've talked to my mom a few times but have pretended to not know anything and to be out of the loop. I've been trying to maintain communication because we still have to get stuff like clothes and their belongings so I've just pretended to not know anything and that I haven't spoken to the case worker. My mom thinks it's just a cooling off period and that it's going to all blow over in a week. My case worker said that they plan to put a warrant out for my brothers arrest on Monday  (according to google, since he was over the age of 30 when he did it he's looking at 10-20 years, so will realistically face about 5ish years) and after he is arrested the case worker has to give my mom an ultimatum. Either my mom puts a protective order and kicks my brother out (while he's on bail) or she lets us keep custody of my nephews. 

I guess I keep going through waves of guilt. My family doesn't see anything wrong with what my brother has done and has even excused it. They blame my nephew because he ""always has an attitude"". They have said things like ""maybe he should be in foster care. Maybe that would be a wake up call that he doesn't have it so bad."" Having grown up around that abuse it makes me think I was wrong and that abuse in normal and I've turned on my family. I feel guilty for lying and pretending that I don't know my brother is going to be arrested. I feel guilty because according to the police my brother was an adult in the house and was allowed to discipline as he saw fit. I know that what happened was abusive and doing drugs with a 12 year old if fucked up, but because I grew up with it it's hard to not try and normalize it. It's hard to not feel like I'm betraying my family. That's all. I wish this was easier. (Also, I'm 35 weeks pregnant and worried about what I'm going to do with all the kids while I'm in the hospital now.)","Going through waves of guilt and hoping I did the right thing by calling CPS.

What lead me to finally call again, is that I had to bring them back home. They were grounded again for giving my mom attitude the day before. I dropped them off at home (told them to look into the gray rock method to help curb their reactions to her when she's purposely pushing their buttons) and went home to shower. After getting out of the shower, I got a call from my nephews saying the cops were there and I had to go get them. (I told them if my brother ever hit them, not to hit him back but to call the police then call me and that's what they did.) I showed up and found out my brother accused my nephews of doing something and started following them around and demanding them to tell the truth. (He was accusing them of stealing drugs, but I don't fully know either way if they were stealing drugs. I do feel like maybe they shouldn't have drugs in the house to begin with.)
My nephew apparently got pissed off and shouted back ""I didn't steal any fucking pills, bruh!"" and my brother told him to hit him. ""Hit me bruh. I know you want to. Just fucking do it! Go on. Hit me bruh!"" My nephew 14, tried to get away and my brother slapped him in the face twice and pushed him into a wall by the neck. The police asked me to pick up either my nephews or my brother because they felt it didn't rise to the level of abuse and later admitted they just didn't feel like arresting my brother. I agreed to take my nephews and they let my brother out of the police car.  So, I picked my nephews back up and was told to keep them for the night. My nephews both said along the lines of ""The cops just let him go? They just failed us. How did that happen?""

I called my mother to let her know what happened and I had the boys again. My mother called my brother and got his version and she came and picked my nephews up to ground them and punish them even longer. I encouraged against it, and insisted she let me stay for the night so everyone could calm down, but she wouldn't let them stay one more night at my house. About an hour and a half after she picked them up, my 14 year old nephew walked in. He had run away and refused to go back home. He said he couldn't do it anymore and was worried he would have to start walking around with a knife because he was scared my brother was going to hit him again and the cops wouldn't do anything again. I had to explain to him that I couldn't legally keep him there. I told him mom could call the cops and I could be arrested if I kept him. He also couldn't just run away because the cops would arrest him.  I told him we could call CPS if he wanted and they can start a new case, but that he would have to go home until CPS did anything. I answered the questions for all the possibilities if CPS got involved. My mother convinced him that if CPS got involved they would take him away forever and wouldn't be allowed to see us ever again. I told him that he could tell CPS to call us and they would try to put them with us first. If we weren't fit, they would go stay in a nice home and they would still be able to visit, call, and see us. I let him know all the options and gave him the choice. 

We called CPS and told them everything that I listed above as well as gave the police report from earlier in the day. We dropped him off at the corner by my mom's house and CPS met him at the door. They went to the hospital where they were drug tested and checked out and CPS made us emergency guardians that night. 

I've talked to my mom a few times but have pretended to not know anything and to be out of the loop. I've been trying to maintain communication because we still have to get stuff like clothes and their belongings so I've just pretended to not know anything and that I haven't spoken to the case worker. My mom thinks it's just a cooling off period and that it's going to all blow over in a week. My case worker said that they plan to put a warrant out for my brothers arrest on Monday  (according to google, since he was over the age of 30 when he did it he's looking at 10-20 years, so will realistically face about 5ish years) and after he is arrested the case worker has to give my mom an ultimatum. Either my mom puts a protective order and kicks my brother out (while he's on bail) or she lets us keep custody of my nephews. 

I guess I keep going through waves of guilt. My family doesn't see anything wrong with what my brother has done and has even excused it. They blame my nephew because he ""always has an attitude"". They have said things like ""maybe he should be in foster care. Maybe that would be a wake up call that he doesn't have it so bad."" Having grown up around that abuse it makes me think I was wrong and that abuse in normal and I've turned on my family. I feel guilty for lying and pretending that I don't know my brother is going to be arrested. I feel guilty because according to the police my brother was an adult in the house and was allowed to discipline as he saw fit. I know that what happened was abusive and doing drugs with a 12 year old if fucked up, but because I grew up with it it's hard to not try and normalize it. It's hard to not feel like I'm betraying my family. That's all. I wish this was easier. (Also, I'm 35 weeks pregnant and worried about what I'm going to do with all the kids while I'm in the hospital now.)",21,8,2023-06-11 20:27,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1474dfv/going_through_waves_of_guilt_and_hoping_i_did_the/,Neutral

Forgive me if this is not allowed here but I need to open up and this community might, and i mean might, understand a little. Probably not but i do t have many options
Im 39 m from uk. . All my life ive loved muscular women. To be hoenst i dont even find normal women attractive even pretty ones. To me they always needed to be muscular. Unfortunately ive never known a muscular woman. Any time a regular woman and i have talked and they wanted to try and date i just couldnt . Yes more than looks matter but i just dont think id be happy or satisfied and even end up resentful
Over time looks fade so i know that muscles wont last forever. But id love to be with a woman who was strong at least for a while and the personality will be there when muscles dont. I know people say im aiming too high but look at say ida bergforth. It feels so unfair her boyfriend met her yet i cant find a single one.
Im forever single. Ive never been kissed even nevermind sex. Im 39. Its sad. Its lonely. I could have dated some regular women if i wanted but if i did id feel like shit because my heart wouldnt have been into them. Id have been doing it purely out of lonliness and nobody deserves to be someones second choice or just there as a blanket against lonliness. Id never do that to someone. So ive suffered alone rather than just make someone else miserable too.
I try to meet muscular women but thats another problem. Im obese. Im 122 kg. I have lost 10kg since jan.i decided then to get fit to try and meet someone because it was silly expecting muscular women to want a fat depressed guy, and i was doing well for a while. But the depression and lonliness kicked i. Two months or so bad and ive struggled since. I stopped caring and realised ive left it so late in life and even if i did get fit i dont know where to even meet a fit muscular woman. None go to my gym its all average and online i get ignored.
Idk im struggling with lonliness. I just hate how hard life is. I also have suffered major depression and have a learning disability so i feel like im fighting a losing battle and dont know what to do. Im cross posting this to a few places so forgive me if you see this elsewhere. I guess i just want to get it off my chest.

I’ve only worked there for three months after leaving my last job. I mainly left because of how they treated workers as a whole and because they blamed me for the SA report I filed. I thought here would be different, but alas, every big name company is the same. 

Last week we got some new guy, we’ll call him John, and I thought he was alright until a few days ago. We were on the register together and he asked me how to open a purse. I said I didn’t know how to and he said “well you should know how to open one, you’re a woman”. I didn’t know how to react so I kind of laughed and said “you’re like a squirrel trying to open a walnut.” The customer was witty enough to say “at least a squirrel would be smart enough to open it” and started giving him attitude after that. I was touched, but it wouldn’t save me from what was about to come. 

I ended up going to my manager, we’ll call him Jay, and telling him about what happened. He told me he would take care of it and so I went on my break. In the middle of my break, he sprints in and very quickly says “John says sorry and it won’t happen again” before speeding off again. I didn’t have time to process until I did and grew angry at Jay. He seemed to be treating the situation like it’s no big deal. Sure it’s not full on harassment, but come on… 

Eventually I went back to work and I saw some inappropriate items being sold at front. I thought it was funny, but I knew families might’ve gotten angry. I went to Jay and asked what I should do to which he responded with attitude and an eye roll saying “if it offends you, you can just throw it away”. I was taken back and went to my work friend, we’ll call her Ella, and told her everything. She told me she overheard Jay talking to John and practically called me sensitive and just told John to not say it away with smiles and laughs. I was furious and felt unsafe so just wanted to go home. I lied and said I needed to go home early and I did.

The next day I ended up telling my managers and people I thought I could trust about the situation. They later told people and ratted me out for gossiping. 

A few days later, I ended up talked with my big boss, we’ll call her Danny, about what happened. I thought she would be sympathetic, but it was so much worse. Throughout the entire conversation she kept interrupting and gaslighting me about the whole ordeal. She kept trying to push this agenda I was making things up or I only reported John as a form of retaliation for him not doing his work. Whenever I tried saying she was wrong about her assumptions, she would hush me and say “I’m right aren’t I?” She was straight up trying to gaslight me. She even tried blaming Ella by saying that what she told me is the only reason I’m upset. 

I’m autistic so it’s already hard enough as it is to communicate properly, so when she kept interrupting me, I just ended up crying out of frustration. 

She was more mad at the fact I told other people what happened rather than the fact he made a sexist comment. Oh boo-hoo, the boy is outed as sexist. It was even more infuriating that Danny was treating John like her own son, while I got treated like a worker. She gave this attitude that he was some poor boy who made a mistake while I’m some evil prissy b-tch.

I’m just so tired of being treated differently solely because of my sex.

18322,13m61h1,post,"Years later, I'm still hurt by my parents' homophobia and wish their love for me included my queerness.","So I (a woman) used to think I was bi, and I always assumed I didn't need to come out to my parents unless I was actively dating another woman. I just always thought they'd be accepting. Then, as a teenager I noticed some things they said that made me think they might be a little prejudiced (e.g. my dad saying ""what are you, *a lesbian*?"" in a very negative tone when I simply said ""I'm not interested in boys right now"" because I was... studying for my exams lol). It made me think they'd still be ok but maybe a little shocked, so I didn't come out until I was in university. I first came out to my mum, who seemed like she would be more open, over Skype. She was quiet and said nothing, but then apparently told my dad, and they both called me on the phone the next day to yell at me. When I visited them that Christmas they pretended everything was fine until they cornered me and yelled at me for ages, gaslit me, twisted my words to make it about them and how much *I* was hurting *them*, I won't go too much into it but it was a harrowing experience. The main thing is, I couldn't get a word in sideways, they were telling me they'd done their ""own research"", etc, and just talking over me so it didn't matter what I said.

After this they never addressed my sexuality, although the year after this, the US (where we don't live) legalised same-sex marriage and my mum, who was visiting me for my birthday, kept on saying ""Well I don't think it should be legal"" as if she was trying to elicit a response. 

That was almost 9 years ago now. During the pandemic, I realised I'm not interested in men at all, and I wanted to make it official and get some closure. I was scared of how they would react, and also didn't want to risk them twisting my words or talking/yelling over me. It was lockdown, so I couldn't meet them face to face, but I also didn't want them to say that I'd picked an impersonal or ""cowardly"" way to come out (which is what coming out over video call was, according to them). So I wrote them a letter. I even read it out to my therapist because I was so worried about it being personal and sensitive and kind to them but also honest.

They never said anything about it for almost a month, even though we spoke daily (this was during the earliest lockdowns). When I finally gave up and asked them if they got my letter (on video call), my dad stormed out of the room and my mum said ""we got it, we have nothing to say, other than I guess I devoted too much time to you and I shouldn't have"". 

It's been years since then and it has never been brought up. I have never properly dated (due to a multitude of reasons, a great deal of them being needing therapy to deal with the damage my parents' reactions over the years have dealt). I've dated around but nothing serious - if it was, I would have had reason to bring it up with my parents. I don't want to bring it up without a reason again, because I've seen the aftermath, and because frankly I've said all I needed to say. But they have never brought it up either. 

We live apart (like, I live in a different country kind of apart), but I'm currently staying with them for almost a month because I need surgery that's more accessible in our country of origin. The past few years have been peaceful, and my parents have been so loving, and because of the surgery situation, they're so doting and careful and loving. It's not pretend, they really do care about me this much, especially when the part of me they can't seem to accept is so neatly tucked away and not spoken of. I'm really enjoying how loved by them I feel. But, out of the blue, I just remembered the situation with the letter, and how they made it like one of the biggest issues they had was that they were really happy to receive a letter from me, and were very happy and touched that I'd written... until they read it, and then their day/life was ruined. So once again, me coming out, has ruined their lives. I'd forgotten this fact, but now that I've remembered it, it hurts so much. It wasn't even my sexuality that hurt them the most (according to them, anyway... I think it was my sexuality that offended them, but they needed a cover story). Even with years of therapy, it's so hard to reconcile the parents I'm seeing today, who are so loving, with the parents who were upset and angry with me because of a letter that said I'm a lesbian. I don't remember the wording but I made it clear in it that I want to be honest and open with them and not hide secrets from them, so I know I didn't say anything hurtful. I know I didn't do anything wrong. It was easier to be angry with them when they were so cold.

But it's so hard now, and it's so hard knowing that there's a part of me that will always be painful to them. I just wish their love for me could overcome their homophobia - which seems to be reserved for me especially. My dad is a bit more homophobic towards other people, but my mum is so readily accepting of others, just not me. I don't know what I've done to provoke this from them, but it hurts so much and I just wanted to get it off my chest because I can't speak to anyone about it right now and it's so hard.

18323,13keghf,post,I'm tired of trying to have friends my age,"I feel like I am always willing to help people who never have time to even hang out with me.  Move your couch? Sure.  You need $20 for gas? No problem.  Help you with the left overs from your estate sale?  Okay. Oh you have kids?  Well we can hang out somewhere with dozens of screaming kids to accommodate that even though I have none and all these places cost money.

Like I offer too cook, I offer to help, I offer to go places I hate and they like and it seems like the only time I can just hang out with someone is in a situation when they need me to do something.  My friends praise me and say how wonderful I am.  But nobody ever has time to just have me over or to get a beer or go to a park.  It's always half work.  I want to sit on a couch and watch a show or go on a walk.  

But it's always like ""hey just set my kitchen on fire, watch my baby, could you throw away this chair on your way out? Your so awesome.  Thanks.  I'm tired, bye!""

I don't know what people want.  If you say you aren't friends they are offended.  But then when you are friends they never have time.   I'm in my late 20's and the only friends I have are in their 70's because they are the only ones who reciprocate care.  They've helped me.  They talk to me.  But every time I try to be friends with someone my age they just seem like they want you to do shit for them for free all the time and then aren't there for you in return.  I feel like every friend my age I have ever had has gotten something  from me or thought they could.  Answers, money, time, work, sex, food, advice therapy, ....and then I'm left with nobody who wants to listen to me or even treat me like a good friend.  

Even in my romantic relationship they start off as friends who seem to want to hang out and then switch to want ignoring me for hours on end for games or tik tok.  I see the way every guy I've dated always acts patronizing towards me when I talk but perks up for any random guy who starts talking.  Doesn't matter what about, it could literally be what I had just said.  It makes me feel like I must be really boring or irritating.  Like I shouldn't even bother talking to anyone.","I'm tired of trying to have friends my age I feel like I am always willing to help people who never have time to even hang out with me.

Like I offer too cook, I offer to help, I offer to go places I hate and they like and it seems like the only time I can just hang out with someone is in a situation when they need me to do something.  My friends praise me and say how wonderful I am.  But nobody ever has time to just have me over or to get a beer or go to a park.  It's always half work.  I want to sit on a couch and watch a show or go on a walk.  

But it's always like ""hey just set my kitchen on fire, watch my baby, could you throw away this chair on your way out? Your so awesome.  Thanks.  I'm tired, bye!""

I don't know what people want.  If you say you aren't friends they are offended.  But then when you are friends they never have time.   I'm in my late 20's and the only friends I have are in their 70's because they are the only ones who reciprocate care.  They've helped me.  They talk to me.  But every time I try to be friends with someone my age they just seem like they want you to do shit for them for free all the time and then aren't there for you in return.  I feel like every friend my age I have ever had has gotten something  from me or thought they could.  Answers, money, time, work, sex, food, advice therapy, ....and then I'm left with nobody who wants to listen to me or even treat me like a good friend.  

Even in my romantic relationship they start off as friends who seem to want to hang out and then switch to want ignoring me for hours on end for games or tik tok.  I see the way every guy I've dated always acts patronizing towards me when I talk but perks up for any random guy who starts talking.  Doesn't matter what about, it could literally be what I had just said.  It makes me feel like I must be really boring or irritating.  Like I shouldn't even bother talking to anyone.",2,0,2023-05-17 21:20,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/13keghf/im_tired_of_trying_to_have_friends_my_age/,Neutral

18325,13c909f,post,My best friend of 8 years said a slur,"My friend of 8 years said something I didn’t like. It’s not just some petty teenage drama. She called my short friend a “midget” jokingly. Another friend told me about it so I ran over and jokingly asked if she said a slur. BFF said “midget is not a slur why are you so offended?” I wasn’t offended for me nor my short friend (we are both very short and around the same height) because she said it likely as a joke. So I pretended to kick BFF. Her toxic friend said “hey, that’s not funny.” (And she thinks taking BFF’s stuff and hiding it for 2 periods when she needs it is funny) “And I jokingly said, “yes it is.” After that I just told BFF that it actually is a slur and she shouldn’t really say that. Then out of nowhere she says “grow the f*ck up.” What??? I get so caught off guard because she’s only done this once before to me ever when she called me homophobic for explaining how trans people work (Transitioning is when you go from your biological sex to your preferred gender and gender fluid people are on the trans spectrum). I say something along the lines of “wow.” She tells me to grow up if I’m offended by it again. I tell her that even though I’m not offended I have the right to be offended because I am an individual who is affected by a growth defect. She goes and sits at another table. My short friend and I look it up and sure enough, it is a slur. I haven’t talked to BFF since.

I kinda needed to type that out. Maybe both of us are being too dramatic. She usually doesn’t act like this.

18326,131iknc,post,My first time doing cocaine became possibly one of the worst decisions I could have made,"This happened about 5 weeks ago and I really need to just let it out. I’m pretty ashamed and know I made a couple of bad decisions so I know I deserve the consequences. 

My (f31) friend, K (f31), and her boyfriend B (f30-31?) did coke one Sunday night. It was my first time and I don’t know what I expected to feel like but I didn’t feel anything. Just that I was more talkative and outgoing and confident. I was there for a few hours, did some lines and just hung out all three of us. I was getting bored and tired so I decided to go home. A little later on B gets my number from K and he sends me a song that he thought I might like since we were all listening to music earlier. We exchanged a few texts about the music and asked how I was feeling after doing coke and told him and joked that I should do this on a daily so I can be more motivated and then into the conversation he tells me he’s headed home and asks if I want to finish this last few lines with him. He lives within walking distance of me so I didn’t think anything of it. It was 2 in the morning so thinking back I know I shouldn’t have done coke alone in the middle of the night with my friends boyfriend while also being in a relationship myself.  But I honestly thought that since we were hanging out earlier it would and he lives down the road that it would be okay. I didn’t have any other intentions, but I just feel naive now. 

B pulls up and we start chatting and showed me another song. Smoked some cigarettes and did some more coke. I should have known something was up when he told me to get in the backseat. I know I’m so stupid. I was planning on sitting opposite sides of the truck and we did. He started opening up about his past and his history. He’s a registered sex offended, but apparently he didn’t do. It happened when he was a teenager and the other when he maybe 18-20 I don’t remember, but apparently that one was some technicality. It’s a very long story. And if he didn’t really do it then I felt bad that he’s had a hard life. After a while says he has to be doing something with his hands, and coke just makes him want to give massages. I didn’t want to and I know should have ended the night there, but he kept offering more coke and so we just kept chatting. Couple hours went by and I go back home. 

I told K about it pretty much when I got home and she was pretty cool about it. She said she set up a plan to see if he would try to get with me when she gave him my number and it worked. She knew something was up when he left and he had brought his backpack to spend the night. She was pissed at B though, left work to go to wake him up at his grandparents house and went off at him. Her and I were okay for that day until the next day. She started asking why I was even with him that late and yes, looking back it doesn’t matter you just don’t hang out alone with you best friends bf in the middle of the night doing coke. I was just thinking it was a platonic thing. She kept asking if we did anything I understand why of course, but I assured her no and told her about the massage thing. For two weeks she called me in the middle of the night and forced me to talk to her for hours answering the same questions she’s already asked. She would get frustrated when I kept saying the same answer. I understand why, but it was exhausting. 

I also told my boyfriend (33) about doing coke at K’s house with her and B and then hanging out with B alone doing coke. Rightfully so, he was pretty hurt and upset by that. He wanted to see the texts between us to see if I was flirting and I told him I already deleted them because I didn’t think I’d be texting B ever again. He wouldn’t talk to me until I got the screen shots. I was desperate because I didn’t want to breakup, so I reached out to B and asked him for the screenshots. He said he would give them to me if we hangout and smoke cigarettes and he had more coke if I wanted some. I said no thanks and asked again for the screenshots and he wouldn’t do it without hanging. Again out of desperation, I agreed. He added giving me a massage and I said no, and said he wouldn’t give me the screenshots otherwise. I felt like I had not choice, so I agreed. 

We meet in this parking lot outside of nowhere and get in his truck. I try to be cool because I’m really trying get those screenshots. So he brings up the massage in ask if he could just massage my arm and he was like no lay across me and I’ll massage your legs. He wouldn’t give me his phone to take screenshots unless  I agreed, so I did. It sucked, I felt so uncomfortable and wrong, but I thought this would help save our relationship. 15 minutes go by, and he’s done touching me. He apologized and felt bad and knew he should have just gave me the screenshots. I said it was okay, and left. 

I blocked him. K kept calling me and texting me for two and half weeks going over the same questions and answers. I was scared to tell her I met with B again for the screen shots. She’s terrifying when she’s mad and was scared what she would do to me if she found out, even though I know I deserve it.","My first time doing cocaine became possibly one of the worst decisions I could have made This happened about 5 weeks ago and I really need to just let it out.

18328,12m1sjp,post,I'm worried about my body count and deciding to turn celibate.,"I (22f) feel ashamed about my 8 person body count. In my teen years I was careless, didn't have the morals I have today, and no mother figure to tell me off for anthing.
 I've just gotten out of a 3 year relationship and I decided I dont want to have sex again until it's with my future husband, as my values have changed a lot since I've become religious and align more with traditional values. The thing is, I am scared that no one will want to date a woman who has had sex with that many people, but won't do it now.

I feel a bit silly posting this at all, but I'd like to hear from anyone who perhaps has been in a similar scenario or, what would your thoughts be on dating a woman like that. 
 Just some notes:
- didn't meant to offend anyone with higher body counts, I don't judge at all this is just how I feel about my situation personally.
- I don't have STDs, but I recommend safe sex to anyone reading!
- my personal values mean that I DO care about how many people I share intimacy with, and I value honesty. It's very special to me and telling me to not care, lie to people or to sleep with even more people isn't helpful.

Thanks for the replies and messages everyone! I'm super grateful to hear all the different points of view. I feel like I've learnt a lot!","I'm worried about my body count and deciding to turn celibate. I (22f) feel ashamed about my 8 person body count.

18329,12jhg0h,post,I secretly recorded my sister's friend,"Tldr at bottom.

This happened over 15 years ago when I was probably around 12 years old. 

My sister, who is a few years older than me, had a close friend (I'll call her ""SF"" for sister's friend) that was at our house almost every day. Since she was around so often and I was just starting puberty, I developed a bit of a crush on her. Her and my sister were on the track and field team together, so it wasn't unusual for her to come straight to our house after practice and take a shower. 

One day,  after stumbling upon a pornagraphic hidden camera video on the internet, I got the idea to set up my cheap camcorder in my sister's room to catch SF changing clothes. I was ""successful.""

Soon after, I did it again. This time, I set my camera in the bathroom, pointing toward the shower and disguised under a pile of clothes. SF came over after school and went straight to take a shower. When I heard the shower shut off, I walked toward the bathroom to ""use the toilet"" and grab my camera. Before I could get there, my sister went in to take a shower. I figured I would just wait until she was done and then go grab the camera, but I quickly heard my sister yell ""oh my God, there's a camera in here and it's pointed right at me."" 

Needless to say, my stomach dropped and I instantly panicked. I literally ran out of the house and hid in a shed crying because I was scared and ashamed.

Maybe 30 minutes later, my dad found and confronted me. He didn't seem angry, but he had to have been ashamed of me. 
He told me he checked and there was nothing on the camera. I told him I ""prayed to god for forgiveness"" because I knew he was a very religious person. Maybe I actually did pray, but I don't remember. I never fully believed in Christianity anyway.

And that was it. There were literally no consequences for me that I can remember, except shame. Nobody in my family has spoken to me about it, and I am about 95% sure my dad lied about there not being anything on the camera to make it seem less bad. 

15 years later, I still think about it and feel terrible. I wish I could apologize to SF and my sister because I'm sure it was traumatic for both of them, probably impacted their lives, and possibly even gave them ptsd. But there's no way I could open that can of worms back up for everyone. The guilt from this has definitely messed up how I form relationships with women. I am absolutely terrified that I may make a woman uncomfortable or pressured to do something, so I do not seek out relationships or sexual partners. 

Looking back, I am appalled that I was never really punished. What I did was disgusting and should warrant prison time, but because I was so young, nothing happened. 

I have never spoken to anyone about this, including every therapist I've had in the last 10 years, so it feels good to finally share this.


TLDR; I was a horny preteen and tried recording my sister's friend in the shower. I got caught when my sister found the camera, and I never suffered any real consequences other than the guilt that I carry and the knowledge that I traumatized my sister and her friend.

18331,1i5nvaz,post,It took me 6 years and moving country to realise that I was in an abusive friendship. I feel very stupid but now everything makes sense. I just need a vent.,"TW: self-harm

When I was in university there was a guy (let's call him Jay) from my course who I'd often see on nights out and who always made an effort or find an excuse to speak with me. We ended up dating and he mentioned that he'd make a point of being at the bar I used to frequent on the days he'd know I was there. In hindsight, that was weird and creepy but at the time I found it cute.

Shortly after we started going out, my friends told me that he made a very inappropriate comment about two of the girls in my friend group. The two girls in question were in a relationship and they were known for stirring drama. At the time, I confronted him to which he completely denied and I believed him. This was roughly 6 years ago and I still don't know who to believe. My friends starting distancing themselves and I ended up having no one but Jay. I already had very poor self-esteem and them leaving so easily really impacted me.

Jay and his friends would often make comments about how I'm boring and cringy because I didn't talk much when they'd engage in gossip or talk about videogames. He often embarrassed me in public (e.g. calling me dictator for absolutely no reason in a party - everyone was as confused as myself but the silence and stares it caused was very humiliating) or make very harsh remarks (e.g. inviting me to see a film and then telling me that I'm only seeing the film with him because I have no friends). But as I say, I had really bad self-esteem and after feeling abandoned by my friends I felt very dependent on him for company. When he was not acting this way he was very fun to be around of and made me laugh a lot. He also had friends and I didn't, which for me was proof that he was likeable and I wasn't.

At some point I couldn't take it anymore and broke up with him. But due to how he reacted, I felt pity and remained his friend. His sister also self-entitled herself as my best friend after speaking with me on maybe 2 or 3 occasions. He acted one way with me and another with his sister, i.e. we were hanging out when a distracted driver on his phone nearly hit me when I was about to cross the road, I confronted him to which Jay repeatedly said how he finds it hot when girls stand up for themselves but when telling his sister about this he said that I made him extremely anxious for causing a scene (I didn't, I only approached the driver's window and asked him to watch what he's doing as he nearly hit me). Both him and his sister would often make comments about how aggressive and confrontational I am, when I'd defend myself of how they treated me or make statements as such as 'I know this isn't you, but you're mental health so I forgive you'. They made me feel like I was this insane, aggressive and unlovable monster.

When I'd try to end our friendship, he'd always force a way back. One time he camped outside of my apartment where I lived with my mom (he really scared her as she was the one who found him at 3-4am) and his entire family was constantly messaging me worried about him as he had vanished that night, blaming me for it when all I did was say I didn't want him in my life. On other occasions he'd burn himself with his cigs on very visible parts of his hand or wrist and tell people I caused that.

Because of how he and his sister made me feel, I wasted my early and mid twenties by never leaving the house or trying to make friends as I felt unlovable and that if I tried to make friends, I'd only receive the same kind of treatment.

Some months ago my aunt died and it uncovered a lot of problems in the family, the whole situation was a massive shock and has been a very traumatic and difficult ordeal. Due to this, I had to return to my home country. This means that I had to quit my job, pack an entire house and arrange transportation of everything to another country in a span of two months whilst grieving, in shock, barely able to eat or sleep. During this time, Jay self-invited himself to my house to 'care for me', he barely helped and was more of a distraction and burden than anything.

On one weekend, he invited me to his house where he lives with his mother and sister. Since his sister was diagnosed with ADHD and autism, she's been even more awful as she uses these diagnosis as an excuse and validation for her actions. I was at my absolute worst during  those months and was mentally very frail, despite knowing this, she was purposefully horrible towards me (i.e. laughing when I was sharing what had happened to my aunt who died of three cancers after she was  the one who asked about it, implying that I have autism when I have been diagnosed with OCD by professional and autism has never even been suspected) and Jay was always taking her side. I returned home earlier than planned because of her and she messaged me once again saying that she knows this wasn't my decision but my mental health to which I responded that it wasn't my mental health but her heartless behaviour that made me leave. She then threw what I can only describe as a very self-entitled defensive tantrum. Even though she was beyond awful to me at a time I was vulnerable, Jay not only took her side but made me feel bad and manipulated me to apologise to her for calling her heartless. Which of course only validated how she had behaved originally and gave her another platform to be horrible towards me.

I've now been in my home country for the last two months and making friends for the first time in six years and everyone's lovely. Nobody is abusive or mean as I expected. Nobody makes me feel boring or cringy. When sharing this experience with others, it is met with shock and disbelief. Although I noticed how horrible they often were, Jay was quite often great company. I accepted this treatment because I was made to believe I was a horrible person that deserved it and had no one else to confirm or deny it. Never once did it cross my mind that I was being abused and gaslighted for the past 6 years.

Now I'm trying to rebuild my life and hopefully still experience some of the things I never had a chance to because of them. I have over a hundred self-harm scars that won't go away even with treatment and I'm still very scared of people. But I feel so motivated and free thanks to this realisation and am keen to improve and start living my life. 

I hope no one is going through this or similar, but if anyone is, I hope they find this post and it helps them wake up and not waste so many years of their lives like I wasted so many of mine.","It took me 6 years and moving country to realise that I was in an abusive friendship.

18332,1i5ntf8,post,My colleague constantly calls me out for mistakes and exposed their dog's genitals during a Teams meeting.,"I’ve been in my role for a few months now, and when I started, Lorraine was training me. Over time, I felt more confident in my role, but I often expressed doubts and mentioned areas where I could use additional training. Lorraine reassured me that I was doing a great job and didn’t need further training.

However, as time went on, Lorraine began emailing me about mistakes I was making, some of which were minor errors that could have been corrected without much effort. Often, when I checked, there wasn’t actually an issue. Sometimes they’d even tell me to “ignore” their comments, but without any apology or acknowledgment.

I sent Lorraine a message on Teams expressing that, while I welcome feedback, the constant emails about mistakes were making me feel uncomfortable and unwelcome. I also mentioned instances where Lorraine would question actions I took, even after being directed by our team manager, which felt undermining.

It’s been over a week since I sent the message, and Lorraine has completely ignored it. Now, I find myself anxious about my work, even though I know what I’m supposed to do. I end up double-checking with other colleagues, who confirm my initial course of action.

Lorraine continues to point out mistakes, even though I’ve noticed they make errors as well, but I choose not to comment on those.

I’ve also noticed that Lorraine can be quite abrupt when I share ideas or suggestions about working practices. On one occasion, they told me, “This is how we’ve always done things.” Despite that, I decided to go ahead and follow my own approach. It turned out to be more efficient, so I shared the results with them. In response, they criticized me for the way I typed something, rather than acknowledging the success of the approach.

I’m constantly anxious at work. I know I need to get a grip but it’s affecting my confidence. 

During a Teams meeting, Lorraine mentioned that they were babysitting their child’s dog. One colleague repeatedly referred to the dog as a “big boy.” Lorraine then repeatedly flashed the dog’s genitals on camera while smirking. It was a very uncomfortable situation.

 A few years ago I was just out of college and in need of financial help.

He convinced my grandmother to lend me a certain amount to help me get by. (She has a pension)  I didn't know anything about this. I was not the one that asked her for help. Next day she sent me the money and dad told me that he convinced her and that I could expect the same amount every month until I was able to get by. I felt relieved.

A few hours later I got a call from my grandmother saying that she'd ""wasted"" enough money on her son and how she didn't have to give me a penny and to return what she'd sent me. I quietly returned the amount. Later I learned that she donated that amount to a local charity for some religious purposes.

Years later, I got a call from my aunt to go help my grandmother (I live in the same town, so do my parents. My aunt lives 6 hours away)
I don't want to. I made an excuse about not being able to get off work but the truth is, I never want to see that woman's face again.

18336,1i5n6dn,post,"I think Playing Super Smash Bros. ""cured"" my depression.","The last few years haven't been easy for me, lots of trouble with school, work, and my girlfriend's family. I've always been the kind of person who hates drama and tries to stay out of it. I’ve always kept my distance to avoid getting involved, so I wouldn't have to pick sides or deal with unnecessary conflict. But sometimes, that just doesn’t work. Some people are so awful that you have no choice but to get dragged into it, which is exactly what happened to me.

I was constantly stressed and never really had a chance to relax or calm down. Every situation, everything I did, came with more stress and made me feel even more depressed. I couldn’t really talk to friends or family because they were all involved in one way or another. No matter how hard I tried to avoid certain topics, they always came up. I just didn’t want to keep talking about everything, it was exhausting and only made me angrier.

Anyway, a few days ago, an old friend texted me. We met years ago playing CS:GO online. We played together for years, and for some events, we even met up in real life. It was a great friendship, but over time, we lost contact. Out of nowhere, he messaged me and asked if he could come over to play Smash on the Switch. I said yes, and he visited me yesterday.

We just sat there, played Smash, and had fun. No talk about the past, no drama—just Smash.

And let me tell you, it was *so* nice and refreshing. For a few hours, I wasn’t thinking about anything stressful—I just had peace in my head. I can’t even explain how good that felt. We’re definitely going to start meeting up regularly now.","I think Playing Super Smash Bros. ""cured"" my depression. The last few years haven't been easy for me, lots of trouble with school, work, and my girlfriend's family. I've always been the kind of person who hates drama and tries to stay out of it. I’ve always kept my distance to avoid getting involved, so I wouldn't have to pick sides or deal with unnecessary conflict. But sometimes, that just doesn’t work. Some people are so awful that you have no choice but to get dragged into it, which is exactly what happened to me.

I was constantly stressed and never really had a chance to relax or calm down. Every situation, everything I did, came with more stress and made me feel even more depressed. I couldn’t really talk to friends or family because they were all involved in one way or another. No matter how hard I tried to avoid certain topics, they always came up. I just didn’t want to keep talking about everything, it was exhausting and only made me angrier.

Anyway, a few days ago, an old friend texted me. We met years ago playing CS:GO online. We played together for years, and for some events, we even met up in real life. It was a great friendship, but over time, we lost contact. Out of nowhere, he messaged me and asked if he could come over to play Smash on the Switch. I said yes, and he visited me yesterday.

A little bit of background on why I’m so pissed at her and disappointed at her.

Anyways, coincidentally we had the same train to that state where our college is (since we had lots of luggage we decided to go through train even though it was 28 hours long journey) and the train station where she lived comes before us so her and her family with her seniors were in the train first but when the train reached our station her parents got off the train and left her with us along with her responsibilities which is very weird because at that point none of us ever went to that place before to the point that they’ll be familiar enough to entrust their kid with other but well it’s not my problem and after we reached we ended up getting the same room and my parents and I even offered her to take us with shopping and she bought some things for herself but my parents paid for it thinking she will give me the money back and there were also things where she should have paid me half because she will be using it as well which she didn’t and she hid the receipt so that I can’t charge her half of it.

Now here comes my friend F20, she comes from the same region as ours but different state so we became friends quickly, long story short after my roommate starter to give me trouble and anxiety I confided in her because I was walking on egg shells almost everyday nor did I tell my parents because u knew they would be very worried for me. But u tried my best to make her feel comfortable, gave her portion of my food when u cooked even tho she doesn’t. Gave her my blanket when she was cold even tho I told her to buy a blanket but she is too frugal to do so(she comes from a upper middle class family but she is just cheap) and took care of her when she got sick even tho u caught it and she just disappeared when I got sick. I confided in my friend and she was very supporting 

Now comes the friends of the same state as me, 3 of them and my friend and me went on a vacation during Christmas and my roommate and 2 more girls from same state stayed (there are 8 of us including my friend) and after we came to our uni my roommate and one of the girl went for vacation and that’s when one of the friend told me everything. How she has always been talking bad about me, how she spreads nasty rumours about me. How she mocks me because I passed an exam she thinks I didn’t study for, all sorts of bs you can imagine but 2 days ago that same girl (who is now my friend and supports me) told me that she took pictures of me sleeping and show it to others just to laugh at it, others however found it very uncomfortable but decided to go along with her and honestly I don’t blame them because my first impression was not good because of a misunderstanding and she managed to make me look like a villain from the very beginning, that friend told me that she was wondering “how can someone be THAT evil and mean” and she didn’t even come to our room because of that so when I found  out what she did about the picture I was furious and wanted to cry from the embarrassment of what she did to me, I immediately called my mom and told her everything and told her I need to change my room as soon as possible and I also called my brother and told him everything and both of them were PISSED to say the least. They called her mom and dad and they of course denied everything but well one thing is that I actually seen one picture she took accidentally, she had her laptop on with my friend from the same state on her bed just right I front of me and thought I wouldn’t see, the thing is I almost didn’t but I saw saw a glimpse of it but then again I thought, “I must be paranoid, she can be a bad roommate but she isn’t capable of doing it” but u was wrong to say the least. Now my parents are in the process of shifting me to a single room while I’m waiting and one more thing, this has all happened while she’s still on vacation so well it would be a disaster when she comes back I doubt everything would be the same. I just hope I get the single room and gtfo of this room.

18339,1i5myn2,post,"I’m exhausted, im a supporter, but get no support","The past 6 months have been really rough. Most recently, this week I’ve gotten particularly exhausted with how much responsibility I have to bear. It wasnt until I made a realization about love, that I realized just how unloved I feel and exhausted I’ve become. I’m 22m, I have two roommates who are very close longtime friends, Cam 23f, and Vanessa 21f (fake names). 


I plan on talking to the people in my life about this but it’s exhausting that I even have to. I’m extremely stressed out, I’ve been waiting to get my cdl, but my exam got delayed due to weather and the holidays. I’m working 2 part time jobs that *barely* pay for necessities while I wait. I’m already stressed out about money and my exam. 


But if I don’t clean, no one else does. If I don’t mention utilities, they go unpaid. I have to make the important phone calls, schedule repairs or fix things myself. If I make plans with someone, I have to be the one to remind them of said plans. I help friends and family with their resumes, with their cars, and just general advice. 


I have a lot more life experience than Cam and Vanessa, I’ve been on my own for almost 5 years, and I was independent long before I was kicked out. I’ve never minded helping them or advising them because I have all this world experience and street smarts that shouldn’t go to waste. But lately it’s gotten to be too much. I have no support system under me. I can’t remember the last time someone checked in on me just to see if Im doing alright. 


Vanessa has been staying with Cam and I for about 6 months after a bad living situation she was in. We’ve known each other 17 years. She considers us friends but the only time she ever talks to me is to ask for advice about school, cars, apartment hunting, or finding roommates or anything else. Or she tells me about a boy she’s planning on getting free dinner from. Don’t get me wrong, I respect the hustle, but not only does it make me kind of uncomfortable how much shit she talks about these men (let me be clear, that if someone around me talked about anyone the way she talks about these men regardless of gender, I would be uncomfortable). It also got old fast. I wish we could have a conversation about something decent. She has also canceled plans on more than one occasion because she had plans with a guy she just met. I should make it clear, that while we have known each other for almost 2 decades, we’ve had limited communication/lost touch for at least half of that time. Even then, it’s frustrating at times. I’ve been trying to introduce her to my friends for months and it hasn’t happened. The most recent conversation we had, all she did was ask me about car insurance plans. 


I have a mother figure who I met when I was 19, I’ll call her T. I call her semi frequently, but not as often as I used to because every time she answers, she tells me she’s busy and that she’ll call me back in x amount of minutes. She never calls me back. 


I feel like I’m the glue that’s keeping everything from falling apart. I’m experiencing severe empathy burnout, I just don’t care. Vanessa’s car was randomly dying, and I did tell her it was probably her battery, but when she asked if I could go with her to get it replaced, I never responded to her text. When Cam was venting to me about life, all I could do is stand there and say “right, yup” but to be honest, I don’t know what she was talking about. I barely cared when tiktok went dark, I don’t ask people how they are anymore. T’s close friend (who I also knew) died last week and when we talked about it on the phone I had to put on my best acting voice to sound upset for her. Our gas bill is months overdue and I don’t care. 


And now, here I am on Monday morning at 5 am, unable to make myself sleep so I can go get some practice at the training lot before my cdl exam on Tuesday. And I don’t even care. I’ve sacrificed so much to make this cdl happen and now I just feel numb and tired. My head fucking hurts. I thought getting this off my chest would help because it usually does, but now my headache is worse and I’m even more emotionally tired. 


I do plan on talking to the people in my life about all of the above, but our schedules are wildly different so it’s hard to find enough free time to really sit down and talk. I can’t get myself to sleep, not even my usual remedy helped. ","I’m exhausted, im a supporter, but get no support The past 6 months have been really rough.

18340,1i5msnv,post,I’m heart broken… for him ,"Sorry this is super long but something recent has made me need to get this off my chest. I’ve also never spoken about This before so I thank you for reading if you choose so.

It’s 2009 and I meet a guy on MySpace through our love of a favourite band. We lived in two different Countries and spoke daily to one another on there. I thought he was the coolest person I’d ever met - musician (mainly drummer), same taste in music, shows, movies and even had the same sense of humour. It was great talking to him and getting to know more about his Country. Weeks turned into months and months turned into a year. Needless to say we were both hooked talking to one another but nothing happened. I knew that my feelings for him were growing however. I even became jealous of girls he would hang around with - though I didn’t have the right to as he wasn’t “mine”. One night I got drunk and while private messaging him I let slip I had feelings for him and even may be falling in love with him. Almost suddenly he said he was feeling the same. And the butterflies grew.

At this time we were still only messaging each other on MySpace. Back then video messaging was barely a thing. But the messaging was fine for both of us. This went on for another 8 years! At this point we were talking on the phone frequently but still it was an online relationship and not once did we physically touch and we were each others.

So I thought.

As time went by I grew suspicious that there was other girls. When I asked him about it he would always deny it and said I was the only one for him. He also said he didn’t have fb which later I found was a lie. I wanted to know why it was secretive though and I soon snooped. Something I didn’t want to have to do. But my suspicions were true and he had a gf who he was living with at the time. My heart was shattered and I broke things off with him. Never to turn back.

Then came lockdown.

I was bored like others were and was ready to connect to those who I hadn’t heard from in a long time. I hadn’t even thought about him for over 10 years but suddenly I was dreaming about him and thinking about him often. I went back and forth for days wondering if I should reach out until I bit the bullet and done so. I didn’t know how it would be received, but it was what it was. The ball was in his court now. Surprisingly he replied almost straight away with welcome arms, saying he always wondered if I was out there somewhere. Now in my heart I knew that this could be dangerous territory. He broke my trust and heart after all and was easily disposable. I gave myself boundaries and said to myself if the feelings are off to trust it and walk away. This reunion was also in a friendly manner. And with that I sent the reply.

It was great at first, we caught up with life and what we had been up to. He talked about how he wrote an album and even had another child. I told him how I moved to a different Country, got my diploma in education and almost was engaged (which ended on friendly terms but he wanted other things different to my wants). It was like the MySpace days. We ended up talking everyday, and even made little vlogs to one another about our surroundings. We even video called! It was all surreal. All through this I still had my boundaries in the back of my head. I didn’t want my joy and excitement to take over. Months went on and that’s when he confessed that his feelings for me had come back and how he wants to come visit me in my Country. I didn’t feel the same way and thought everything was moving too fast. It was still lockdown so I knew he couldn’t come here anyway. I just replied like I didn’t see that message and just went on to another topic which seemed to work. Weeks and months went by and suddenly I caved. I was getting those dreaded feelings again that I didn’t want to. I didn’t tell him this, although I feel like he must have known. We eventually spoke about relationships and what would happen if one of us got into one. We both decided that this is how we would want to know and not find out, but it would be respectable of one another. That same week things turned upside down. He was starting barber college and I was excited for him to do so. I planned to send flowers off to him to congratulate him so o asked for his address. This is where he suddenly became weird and distant. Saying smartass things towards me. I thought maybe I had crossed the line so I just aplogised. I was hurt and it was late so I just went to bed. The next morning I was woken by around 20 messages all from him asking where I was, one after the next getting aggravated that wasn’t responding (I was asleep and it’s 12 hrs difference) until the last ones absolutely lashing out at me and bringing up MySpace days that I was a psychotic b for snooping around his business and then saying that he’s seeing a beautiful girl that will be his girlfriend. - all what we discussed about telling each other about other people was out the door. He told me just to hurt me. Just because I was asleep and didn’t reply. Once again I was heart broken. I thought he had changed and that he actually loved me. I told him I was happy for him and that I hope she treats him good. He hated that I said this (even though I was genuine about it) and lashed out at me once again. I’m thinking he hated that I wasn’t showing I was hurt even though I deeply was. Silly me. So I just let it be again.

Randomly he messages me one night weeks after as if nothing happened. At this point I was over him but I replied anyway out of boredom in half ass tones. He still acted like nothing happened. That what he said was absolutely disgusting and something that I didn’t deserve. All I wanted to do is send him flowers because I was proud of him. I now know why, because there was someone else.  Days passed and we still talked. Or might I say HE did. I never made him my priority. If I saw the message I would reply later on if I remembered but I wasn’t going out of my way for him. I thought he would get the hint, but he didn’t.  Then one day he wrote me a big message about even though he has a gf he wished it was me. That I was his ultimate dream and that I was always number one in his life. That he was obsessed with me back in the MySpace days and obsessed with me now. That he hates that we have never touched in the physical world but still wishes everyday for it to be a possibility. And that he was sorry for all that he put me through. I replied with that he has a gf and I don’t want to hurt her and that I’m sorry that it’s too late. We can be friends but that’s it. He agreed and we spoke every now and then when we both could. Lockdown is over and I’m back at work but not for long. I get told that my building will be shut down by the end of the year. I become depressed and just need someone. That’s where he steps in and becomes a support system I needed. We talk again every day and send each other stupid videos of our day. It was great and what I needed. By the end of the year I feel a change again in him, he’s acting distant and not himself. I ask if he’s ok and he reassures me that he is. I tell him constantly that I’m here for him if I need him. He thanks me for always being sweet to him and that he loves me. I tell him the same. My work ends and I’m stressed out trying to look for another one, I knew that he had something going on so I didn’t want to disturb him with my depressed feelings. Then comes February. He is still in a slump and although I’m supportive I ask him straight out what is wrong and for him to tell me the truth. This is where he says that he has a gf (which I knew I respected boundaries) and that he couldn’t talk to me anymore because of it. This blew me away. NOT AGAIN. This guy is breaking my heart again! Even in a platonic sense. I didn’t understand, we weren’t doing anything but talking but I understood that he has to put the gf first. So with that that was the last time we spoke ever again.

2024 - I kept getting feelings that something wasn’t right. It’s strange but me and him always had a deep connection and any time I knew something was wrong with him, I was right. And unfortunately I very much was when I didn’t want to be. Out of curiosity I typed his name in google, and there it was. His obituary. My whole world crumbled suddenly. He had been gone two weeks at that time and I never knew. Because I was just an online “friend” I guess his loved ones didn’t know about me so I never knew. My heart was shattered. I didn’t even know what to feel. I didn’t even know if I had a right to feel like I was because I didn’t even meet him irl but I was sad, and could feel my heart actually breaking. I would go on to say that he was the love of my life, and even though he put me through so much I still was so in love it him. 

When looking at his obituary I saw that he was still with his gf. I felt so sad for her and the rest of his loved ones. It was a strange feeling. But no one in my life knew of him either and so I had to go through this mourning period alone and not tell anyone. 

Yesterday, I missed him a whole lot so I looked up his obituary and read what his girlfriends name was, I decided to look her up in some hope that I could see photos of him that I hadn’t before. I saw photos, I cried, and to my surprise I saw her most recent pics of her and her new boyfriend. 8 months he had been gone and she has already found someone new. My heart for the very last time was heart broken - but for him. I know that she deserves happiness but to move on so quickly is just a slap in the face. And then I’m here, still looking up at the sky wondering if he’s watching over me and finally being around me like he always wanted to be. And just thinking about what could have been. 

","I’m heart broken… for him  Sorry this is super long but something recent has made me need to get this off my chest. I’ve also never spoken about This before so I thank you for reading if you choose so.

It’s 2009 and I meet a guy on MySpace through our love of a favourite band. We lived in two different Countries and spoke daily to one another on there. I thought he was the coolest person I’d ever met - musician (mainly drummer), same taste in music, shows, movies and even had the same sense of humour. It was great talking to him and getting to know more about his Country. Weeks turned into months and months turned into a year. Needless to say we were both hooked talking to one another but nothing happened. I knew that my feelings for him were growing however. I even became jealous of girls he would hang around with - though I didn’t have the right to as he wasn’t “mine”. One night I got drunk and while private messaging him I let slip I had feelings for him and even may be falling in love with him. Almost suddenly he said he was feeling the same. And the butterflies grew.

At this time we were still only messaging each other on MySpace. Back then video messaging was barely a thing. But the messaging was fine for both of us. This went on for another 8 years! At this point we were talking on the phone frequently but still it was an online relationship and not once did we physically touch and we were each others.

So I thought.

As time went by I grew suspicious that there was other girls. When I asked him about it he would always deny it and said I was the only one for him. He also said he didn’t have fb which later I found was a lie. I wanted to know why it was secretive though and I soon snooped. Something I didn’t want to have to do. But my suspicions were true and he had a gf who he was living with at the time. My heart was shattered and I broke things off with him. Never to turn back.

Then came lockdown.

I was bored like others were and was ready to connect to those who I hadn’t heard from in a long time. I hadn’t even thought about him for over 10 years but suddenly I was dreaming about him and thinking about him often. I went back and forth for days wondering if I should reach out until I bit the bullet and done so. I didn’t know how it would be received, but it was what it was. The ball was in his court now. Surprisingly he replied almost straight away with welcome arms, saying he always wondered if I was out there somewhere. Now in my heart I knew that this could be dangerous territory. He broke my trust and heart after all and was easily disposable. I gave myself boundaries and said to myself if the feelings are off to trust it and walk away. This reunion was also in a friendly manner. And with that I sent the reply.

It was great at first, we caught up with life and what we had been up to. He talked about how he wrote an album and even had another child. I told him how I moved to a different Country, got my diploma in education and almost was engaged (which ended on friendly terms but he wanted other things different to my wants). It was like the MySpace days. We ended up talking everyday, and even made little vlogs to one another about our surroundings. We even video called! It was all surreal. All through this I still had my boundaries in the back of my head. I didn’t want my joy and excitement to take over. Months went on and that’s when he confessed that his feelings for me had come back and how he wants to come visit me in my Country. I didn’t feel the same way and thought everything was moving too fast. It was still lockdown so I knew he couldn’t come here anyway. I just replied like I didn’t see that message and just went on to another topic which seemed to work. Weeks and months went by and suddenly I caved. I was getting those dreaded feelings again that I didn’t want to. I didn’t tell him this, although I feel like he must have known. We eventually spoke about relationships and what would happen if one of us got into one. We both decided that this is how we would want to know and not find out, but it would be respectable of one another. That same week things turned upside down. He was starting barber college and I was excited for him to do so. I planned to send flowers off to him to congratulate him so o asked for his address. This is where he suddenly became weird and distant. Saying smartass things towards me. I thought maybe I had crossed the line so I just aplogised. I was hurt and it was late so I just went to bed. The next morning I was woken by around 20 messages all from him asking where I was, one after the next getting aggravated that wasn’t responding (I was asleep and it’s 12 hrs difference) until the last ones absolutely lashing out at me and bringing up MySpace days that I was a psychotic b for snooping around his business and then saying that he’s seeing a beautiful girl that will be his girlfriend. - all what we discussed about telling each other about other people was out the door. He told me just to hurt me. Just because I was asleep and didn’t reply. Once again I was heart broken. I thought he had changed and that he actually loved me. I told him I was happy for him and that I hope she treats him good. He hated that I said this (even though I was genuine about it) and lashed out at me once again. I’m thinking he hated that I wasn’t showing I was hurt even though I deeply was. Silly me. So I just let it be again.

Randomly he messages me one night weeks after as if nothing happened. At this point I was over him but I replied anyway out of boredom in half ass tones. He still acted like nothing happened. That what he said was absolutely disgusting and something that I didn’t deserve. All I wanted to do is send him flowers because I was proud of him. I now know why, because there was someone else.  Days passed and we still talked. Or might I say HE did. I never made him my priority. If I saw the message I would reply later on if I remembered but I wasn’t going out of my way for him. I thought he would get the hint, but he didn’t.  Then one day he wrote me a big message about even though he has a gf he wished it was me. That I was his ultimate dream and that I was always number one in his life. That he was obsessed with me back in the MySpace days and obsessed with me now. That he hates that we have never touched in the physical world but still wishes everyday for it to be a possibility. And that he was sorry for all that he put me through. I replied with that he has a gf and I don’t want to hurt her and that I’m sorry that it’s too late. We can be friends but that’s it. He agreed and we spoke every now and then when we both could. Lockdown is over and I’m back at work but not for long. I get told that my building will be shut down by the end of the year. I become depressed and just need someone. That’s where he steps in and becomes a support system I needed. We talk again every day and send each other stupid videos of our day. It was great and what I needed. By the end of the year I feel a change again in him, he’s acting distant and not himself. I ask if he’s ok and he reassures me that he is. I tell him constantly that I’m here for him if I need him. He thanks me for always being sweet to him and that he loves me. I tell him the same. My work ends and I’m stressed out trying to look for another one, I knew that he had something going on so I didn’t want to disturb him with my depressed feelings. Then comes February. He is still in a slump and although I’m supportive I ask him straight out what is wrong and for him to tell me the truth. This is where he says that he has a gf (which I knew I respected boundaries) and that he couldn’t talk to me anymore because of it. This blew me away. NOT AGAIN. This guy is breaking my heart again! Even in a platonic sense. I didn’t understand, we weren’t doing anything but talking but I understood that he has to put the gf first. So with that that was the last time we spoke ever again.

2024 - I kept getting feelings that something wasn’t right. It’s strange but me and him always had a deep connection and any time I knew something was wrong with him, I was right. And unfortunately I very much was when I didn’t want to be. Out of curiosity I typed his name in google, and there it was. His obituary. My whole world crumbled suddenly. He had been gone two weeks at that time and I never knew. Because I was just an online “friend” I guess his loved ones didn’t know about me so I never knew. My heart was shattered. I didn’t even know what to feel. I didn’t even know if I had a right to feel like I was because I didn’t even meet him irl but I was sad, and could feel my heart actually breaking. I would go on to say that he was the love of my life, and even though he put me through so much I still was so in love it him. 

When looking at his obituary I saw that he was still with his gf. I felt so sad for her and the rest of his loved ones. It was a strange feeling. But no one in my life knew of him either and so I had to go through this mourning period alone and not tell anyone.

I'm pretty sure my mum's gonna cause stress though. I intend to not invite her family as they all cause me massive stress and I don't need that at my wedding. My sister tried to not invite our grandma on that side to her wedding because we both hate her but my mum forced her to. I don't have all the details on that though. So my mum might just refuse to come unless I invite her family which would suck but I'd rather not have that part of the family there.

She'd likely cause stress if she did come though. The last two weddings she's attended she's made her own outfit, which is fine, she's an amazing seamstress. However she finished them on the day. She wasn't late to my sister's wedding but did miss events the day before that caused my sister to stress out. She missed most of my cousin's wedding because she was making her dress though. So I'm scared that if she does come she'll cause me a lot of stress by not turning up when I need/expect her. I'm thinking of telling her the wedding will be a week earlier than it will be but me and my partner are likely going to have a destination wedding so it likely wouldn't work.

I know I don't need to even be thinking about this right now but I couldn't sleep last night and these thoughts flew through my mind and I'm letting them out here.","Distance future stress So I'm not engaged yet but me and my partner are pretty sure we're going to get married in the future.

18342,1i5mj0j,post,Update 1:  I Offered to Be a Sperm Donor for Someone Close to Me. It Ended in Heartbreak.,"Firstly, thank you all so much for the overwhelming outpouring of support and kindness following my original post. I never imagined my little story would resonate so deeply with so many people. Your words and empathy have meant the world to me, so thank you.

Now to the update.

Nothing has happened with Katie yet. She hasn’t reached out to me or made any attempt to work with me to repair our relationship. She hasn’t even offered an apology for the comment she made about my body, which sucks—but at this point, it is what it is.

The reason for this update is that something that happened while I was packing for a recent move. I’ve just bought a new house (yay), and during the chaos of packing, I stumbled upon something I’d completely forgotten about.

Early on in our conception journey, I bought a book called My Donor Dad. It’s a cute little book designed for known donors, where you fill in details for the donor-conceived child: stories about your childhood, your favorite things, your career, places you’ve traveled, and more. It also has spaces for deeper reflections, like why you chose to be a donor, things that matter to you, and even a place to write a letter to the child.

At the time, I filled it out with so much love and excitement for what we were creating together. I even wrote a heartfelt letter to Katie’s future child.

The smart thing to do when I found it would’ve been to toss it immediately.

Instead, I did the dumb thing: I opened it and read it.

To say it was emotionally devastating would be an understatement. The book was a stark reminder of a very different relationship Katie and I once had—one filled with love, respect, and a shared vision for something special and meaningful. Seeing that contrasted with the recent realisation that she likely never really respected me has been incredibly painful.

I haven’t been doing well since reading it. I didn’t sleep at all last night and I had a panic attack today that was so bad an ambulance had to be called.

Eventually, I decided to reach out to her. I described what I’d found, explained what was in it, and asked if I should toss it or give it to her. For reasons I can’t quite understand, she said she wanted it. So I sent it to her.

That’s where things are for now. If anything more happens, I’ll update again.","Update 1:  I Offered to Be a Sperm Donor for Someone Close to Me. It Ended in Heartbreak.

A priest sort of gut who repeatedly falls from the ceiling above my bed (idk how to explain it but yeah anyways) 2. This nun thing in the corner of my room that seems to get closer whenever i look away, 3. This shadow man type thing who mostly resides behind my bookshelf but also comes to school with me sometimes which did lead to me failing an exam or two ( the exam failing was also due to the fact i couldnt see the exam room as the ground looked like flesh and veins and i dont know how to explain it but it was bad and im not good at maths on a good day) 4. A sort of shadow spider thing that actually looks a little like that one guy from the sonic games who i cant remember the name of but in snapcube fandubs hes called the devil and 5. A gored baby. I've never considered myself religious in any way and i wasnt brought up like that, both of my parents are super atheist and i dont really know whats going on. Sometimes i feel like im on a completely different plain and i write crazy things like release me from my mortal flesh and stuff its kind of freaking me out. There you go.

18346,1i5m9e3,post,I'll never feel beautiful andI hate that I care ,"I'm a woman in the latter half of her 20s. I have never been beautiful. I have suffered a lot in life and done my fair share of bad things, too. 

I was abused as a child and grew up in isolation.I have a severe mental health problem that renders me partially disabled. I had a phase where I self harmed through sex. I used to abuse drugs, wanting to die, but I'm clean now. None of this is outwardly visible, I don't think, except for scars left by cuts/stabbing. I think it's understandable that after the life I had, I want more than anything to feel safe and accepted.

But I don't, and I can't, and the reason is so silly. I am just not as pretty as other women my age. I don't look the way I'm supposed to. I don't weigh under 60 kilograms, I don't have flawless skin, I don't have huge ultra-perky breasts and a tiny waist and a flat stomach.

I feel too inferior to other women to befriend them, and I feel looked down upon by men for my lack of sexual desirability. It feels like I was rejected by the in-group permanently because my only value is my physical appearance and body. I spend a lot of my extra money on supplements and skin care, hoping I can become beautiful, but I know it's no use.

I guess I'm wondering how to stop the craving I feel for acceptance. I want to become normal and I have to let go of that want and accept that I'm weird and a fringe member of society... how do I accept that when all the messaging around me is telling me I'm inferior?

How can I ever like myself if I'm not what a woman is supposed to be? I won't have kids because it's been made clear to me that my genes are inferior and shouldn't spread. I'm just grieving the life I could've had if I looked how I'm supposed to. 

I've tried losing weight, now I'm down to a size 8, but it didn't help. i tried makeup, it doesn't help. I've tried all sorts of hair care and skin care and it doesn't help.

18347,1i5m98z,post,Feeling unwanted,"I had a moment today where I was reminded of the one truly good relationship I ever had. It was back in high school. He was my first boyfriend, and his love for me made me cocky. He was the first man who ever wanted me, and I thought: if I can get him, I can get other men, too. Maybe even better men - taller, handsomer than he was. (Awful, I know.)

He often told me how much he loved me; how he thought I was the most beautiful girl he’d ever seen, and how each of my insecurities were invisible to him. He told me he wanted to marry me someday. But I was only 17, and I didn’t realize how rare this love I had was, so I took his words for granted.

After two years together, I broke up with him in the months before graduation. I applied to different colleges than him, even though he wanted to attend the same one. Then, in a moment of regret – almost like I saw my lonely future coalescing in front of me – I asked him if we could get back together. He agreed, but I could immediately that tell his trust in me was forever lost. Sure enough, as soon as we got to college, he replaced me with another girl.

It’s been 4 years since then, and he’s still with that girl. They’re getting married soon. I’m blocked on everything – he went no contact just a week after he met her.

Meanwhile, I’m still alone. I’ve realized over the years that I’m not as beautiful as he promised I was. It’s hard for me to get noticed by guys, even harder to find one who wants to date me.

My best friend is getting married to her high school sweetheart this summer, and I’ve had to hide that I’m actually truly, awfully jealous of her. All I can think of is that I had a love like hers once, and I threw it away. I arrogantly assumed that because one man loved me, I could be loved just as hard by other men, too. And now I have this feeling that I’ll never find it again. 

I wish I could be happy for other people in love, but it’s so hard. I couldn’t even read romance novels, my favorite genre, for two years after the breakup. I just want this feeling to be over. It’s been long enough. ","Feeling unwanted I had a moment today where I was reminded of the one truly good relationship I ever had. It was back in high school. He was my first boyfriend, and his love for me made me cocky. He was the first man who ever wanted me, and I thought: if I can get him, I can get other men, too. Maybe even better men - taller, handsomer than he was. (Awful, I know.)

He often told me how much he loved me; how he thought I was the most beautiful girl he’d ever seen, and how each of my insecurities were invisible to him. He told me he wanted to marry me someday. But I was only 17, and I didn’t realize how rare this love I had was, so I took his words for granted.

After two years together, I broke up with him in the months before graduation. I applied to different colleges than him, even though he wanted to attend the same one. Then, in a moment of regret – almost like I saw my lonely future coalescing in front of me – I asked him if we could get back together. He agreed, but I could immediately that tell his trust in me was forever lost. Sure enough, as soon as we got to college, he replaced me with another girl.

It’s been 4 years since then, and he’s still with that girl. They’re getting married soon. I’m blocked on everything – he went no contact just a week after he met her.

Meanwhile, I’m still alone. I’ve realized over the years that I’m not as beautiful as he promised I was. It’s hard for me to get noticed by guys, even harder to find one who wants to date me.

My best friend is getting married to her high school sweetheart this summer, and I’ve had to hide that I’m actually truly, awfully jealous of her. All I can think of is that I had a love like hers once, and I threw it away. I arrogantly assumed that because one man loved me, I could be loved just as hard by other men, too. And now I have this feeling that I’ll never find it again. 

I wish I could be happy for other people in love, but it’s so hard. I couldn’t even read romance novels, my favorite genre, for two years after the breakup. I just want this feeling to be over. It’s been long enough. ",1,1,2025-01-20 9:11,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1i5m98z/feeling_unwanted/,Neutral

18350,1i5m2hc,post,I cooked all day for a dinner party and no one showed up…,"I invited 7 friends over to my place tonight for dinner/games (I’m a college student). It’s hard enough being the only person in the group who plans everything and brings us all together. I got confirmation from each of them last week and briefly checked in this morning. However, one by one, they all canceled/flaked out on coming over as I finished preparing the food this afternoon.

I spent hours making homemade ramen plus an assortment of side dishes such as dumplings, katsu, and edamame. I’ve made food for my friends in the past, and many of them have commented that I’m an excellent cook. I’m just sad now that they won’t be able to try this dish because I think it’s one of my best yet. I’m introverted, but I love to cook for people and bring friends together. It seems like everyone has a great time when they actually follow through, but it’s so hard to get people to show up nowadays.

Beyond the dinner party disappointment today, it takes a lot of energy to consistently make sizable unreciprocated efforts to maintain friendships. I’m slowly becoming increasingly jaded, and I sometimes wonder if it’s even worth the effort. I can’t speak for the future, but for now, I will continue hoping and trying.

18351,1i5m2fd,post,I’d probably not want to live if I end up alone,"To tell it simply, I grew up in a toxic household with super incompatible marriage between parents, they separated. Growing up, I never thought of what I wanted for me. Or if I even wanted marriage. I focused on my career and myself. 

In my mid 20s now and I always think about what a happy marriage and kids would look like for me. But I feel really broken at the thought that I might never have it. Finding love in a good man is so rare these days. Men on dating apps just want to hook up, and I don’t see it happening with me in real life because I am just an awkward person. It’s possible I might never find someone. 

It might be embarrassing to say this, but I want to get married, have a loving husband, be a wife, have amazing sex (lol), carry his babies in me, raise them together with love and peace that I never got at my home, grow old with him, just a calm simple life with pockets of joy. Of course there would be ups and downs. But I’d want that life. 

I’m nowhere near this dream, getting close to 30s in 4 years. Prospects dry up at that age. I feel like I have wasted a major portion of my life not looking for this. I am not suicidal but I don’t see a point in living more if this doesn’t happen to me at least by 30s. I have spent most of my life alone in a toxic environment, I don’t wish to spend the rest of it alone even if it’s in a peaceful environment.

18352,1i5m0bc,post,Emotional affair with my supervisor,"I'm a student in a grad program. Last year, my internship supervisor became really interested in me. It felt romantic/sexual. Nothing inappropriate was ever said or done, but they gave me way more attention than anyone else. Other people made comments about it, too. At times, it felt really flirty. They wanted to hang out outside of work - with a group, but they were very focused on me.

I felt really confused because I quite liked them. If they weren't my supervisor, I would have definitely been interested. But, they were my supervisor. It alarmed me that they thought this was OK. They also have a partner, so this clearly couldn't go anywhere. Then, I thought I was making all this up because they were subtle about what they wanted, often had reasons/excuses for what they did, and seemed to think everything was normal and good.

When my internship ended, they asked me to come back for a certain project, so we stayed in contact related to that. After a while, it felt like they were maybe extending the project unnecessarily. Eventually, they went on sabbatical and that ended.

I started a new internship, at an organization where they had previously worked. Since they were on sabbatical, they started volunteering there. They later implied several times that they didn't know I was interning there...but they definitely knew at one point, although maybe they forgot. Again, they were super focused on me, and this time it was definitely not about work.

I had mixed feelings. I definitely had feelings for them, I liked talking to them, felt close to them, and wanted to see them more. But I didn't like that they were being so intense about it, and using my workplace to see me. I thought, ""If you want to see me so bad, why not just ask me to hang out? And if you don't feel like it's OK to ask me to hang out, why is it OK to hang out at my work?"" I worried that the answer to that question was: their partner doesn't know what goes on at work.

Anyway, my boss didn't like this and started putting her foot down. They finally started just asking me to hang out outside of work. I thought this was a step in the right direction, better than the situation at my internship.

When we'd hang out, mostly it felt fine. Except that they'd never talk about their partner, and they'd actively downplay the seriousness of the relationship. Sometimes they'd make sexual references. Which did make me uncomfortable, even though they weren't my supervisor anymore. I think because I didn't know where the boundaries were.

I finally met their partner, and things were super weird and uncomfortable there. They made efforts to not act too close with me in front of their partner and friends...but even then, they were still giving me way too much attention.

That was enough for me. I texted them that I don't want to see them anymore because of problems with our boundaries. They said a bunch of supportive stuff but nothing about what they think or what they want.

Many months passed, and eventually I reached out to tell them some career news and we caught up a little. It was all very professional. The only thing was that they still pretended their partner didn't exist. I could hear them actively leaving her out. I asked a bunch of follow up questions and finally they said something about her.

I don't know, man. I feel like I got the worst of all worlds here. We aren't friends. We aren't lovers. We are on okay professional terms, thanks to my efforts to a) work through my thoughts and acknowledge the problem, b) speak up about the problem and set boundaries, and then c) smooth it over so it's not awkward forever. And d) forgive myself for my mistakes and rebuild my self-esteem.

I'm pissed off that NOW they can act professional. After they made two internships really fucking weird for me, and told themself it was for my benefit because they're mentoring me. After I busted my ass to break into a new career path so I wouldn't end up working with them again.

And I'm pissed off that they don't seem to have learned anything. They're still acting like their partner doesn't exist. After I cut them off, I'm pretty sure they got a mutual connection to try to recruit me for their employer. I would have considered it if they talked to me about it, talked through the issues. But no. Too scary.

I feel like I had to do a lot of work here. They just had a bunch of feelings and made it my problem to figure it out. And I see no signs that they've learned anything from losing me as a friend, colleague, love interest. Which I know they strongly wanted me to be some or all of those things.

They know they were being shady with me. They referenced it a couple of times. I think they do actually feel really bad about it. They're not one of those people who's like, ""It's no big deal if I cheat on my wife."" I think that would be easier to handle. Instead, they have to make the thing that they're doing ""not cheating"" so that they can keep doing it. And that makes it my problem.

And yeah, I'm pissed off at myself too, for participating and instigating. I liked and wanted and asked for their attention. Especially during the first half, when it felt more like a silly thought than a real problem. Maybe the thing I'm really pissed off about is that it's not going to work out between us. Even if they and their partner broke up, I've seen too much. The way they talk about their partner? I don't want to be her.

So it was just a waste of a year, in so many ways. The only thing that wasn't a waste was the strength I learned when I spoke up, and had to rebuild my career and my mentality after.","Emotional affair with my supervisor I'm a student in a grad program.

18355,1i5lowy,post,I don't know how to stop hurting.,"And I'm tired of feeling this way and typing out. I just don't know how to deal with where I am. I'm isolating myself from others, and not able to pursue a fulfilling relationship. I'm still hung up on my ex and not in the omg i still want them way but more in the how could they, do/did they even care, and wishing I could eternal sunshine of the spotless mind myself. 

I hurt so deeply. I believe I'm depressed but I don't want to go on any medication.   
In my relationship I was naive and somehow fell into a relationship where they pushed away my friends and hurt my family and disrespected me. I have things I want to say and tell people but the only person i'd ever talk about them with is not that person anymore. You lose your best friend.

I try to stop hurting. I go no contact, I pick up new skills, I read, I look forward and prioritize myself but when I lay down I am not fulfilled and am still anxious. I want to stop being anxious. I'm always anxious. not about something but a feeling of nervousness that radiates around me, sometimes numbing, sometimes faint, sometimes giving me sweats. I'm not living, I feel like I'm just killing time. 

im sick of self pity and myself. I do suffer from suicidal ideation. I don't like hating people. Hate is an extreme and virulent emotion reserved for things and people who hurt others. but i don't hurt people and I still feel like I hate myself more than I'll ever hate any other person. 

I've had sex and intimacy and have experienced love.  It's difficult after being in a relationship where you're being slowly removed from everyone who cares for you and then being told it's you and your manipulative partner versus the world. Life only makes sense in reverse with hindsight 20/20. It was my first and only relationship and it lasted years. The damage it's had on me and my psyche I can't even express in words. You think you've hit the jackpot first try and are desperate to cling on. and then it's gone. you've never been broken up with. you've only loved once. you thought that things could always get worked out. I thought, I mean. But now, I hate them. I didn't hate them for a while. But they hurt me, hurt my friends, hurt my family, and not just emotionally. 

Imagine dedicating yourself 24/7 emotionally and physically and after their infatuation period wears off and yours is still going strong a year+ later they degrade you verbally, criticize in private, in public, in front of friends, in front of family. Call you weak, sensitive, scream at you and then go non verbal and you have to cheer THEM up. I only got angry like this when I thought of those who wronged my ex. But now I feel so abused, taken advantage of, and mislead. I'm so angry and I never fought back to defend myself. Do I need closure? I don't know. I don't know if i'd be able to speak if I saw them again. Maybe I'd freeze, maybe i'd run or maybe i'd go into a blind rage and start wailing on them.

I hope i stop feeling like this. I wish i could know if they're anguishing like me. but they're too prideful, narcissistic and riddled with a victim complex.","I don't know how to stop hurting. And I'm tired of feeling this way and typing out. I just don't know how to deal with where I am. I'm isolating myself from others, and not able to pursue a fulfilling relationship. I'm still hung up on my ex and not in the omg i still want them way but more in the how could they, do/did they even care, and wishing I could eternal sunshine of the spotless mind myself. 

I hurt so deeply. I believe I'm depressed but I don't want to go on any medication.   
In my relationship I was naive and somehow fell into a relationship where they pushed away my friends and hurt my family and disrespected me. I have things I want to say and tell people but the only person i'd ever talk about them with is not that person anymore. You lose your best friend.

I try to stop hurting. I go no contact, I pick up new skills, I read, I look forward and prioritize myself but when I lay down I am not fulfilled and am still anxious. I want to stop being anxious. I'm always anxious. not about something but a feeling of nervousness that radiates around me, sometimes numbing, sometimes faint, sometimes giving me sweats.

I had said we should all dress up as characters from Super Mario, i was Luigi, my best friend was Mario (will call him John), his girl was peach (will call her Ashley), and her friend was Daisy.

One of me and John's friends wanted to join in, we didn't know who he could be, but he said he could be Bowser, so we let him join to. We had 6 people trick or treating, or so i thought... there were 3 siblings coming, so then 9 people, it was somehow still okay. A couple days before halloween, my dad got a text from Ashley's mom saying, ""Sorry, but there are too many people going trick or treating, we have to kick (me) out of the plan, sorry."" I had been left out of my own idea, i had come up with a great idea, everyone loved it, i elaborated on it, everyone loved it, more people wanted to join, and then out of all the 8 other people going, the one who came up with the idea, who made the plan, who gave everyone their characters too... got kicked out.

18357,1i5ljmx,post,"Sacrificed myself for a project (and by extension, a friend group)","Okay, so there’s a project that I’ve been part of for about a month. Recently, Project Leader really wants to bring on Collaborator A (and I know that he likes her and wants to use this as an opportunity to get closer to her). Collaborator A apparently wants to bring on Collaborator B (who is friends with her). However, Collaborator B has been borderline harassing and stalking me for the past few years and I refuse to work with him. Collaborator B has a motive to get involved in projects that I’m involved in so he can stay somewhat close to me, and this is not the first time he’s tried this. So I bring my discomfort with Collaborator B to Project Leader’s attention, but he suggests that if we don’t accept Collaborator B, then we might not want to accept Collaborator A because of their connection. But that obviously goes against Project Leader’s wish to work with Collaborator A. Instead of making a decision himself, he leaves it up to me to decide, which puts me in a terrible position, because who am I to make Collaborator A collateral damage in this situation. Who am I to get between Project Leader and Collaborator A. So instead, I resign. And give a reason that is completely made up, because I’m afraid if the true reason gets back to Collaborator A or B, either could retaliate against me. So now, everyone will hear the completely made up reason why I resigned and make all kinds of assumptions about me. I literally can’t say anything out of 1) fear of retaliation and 2) fear of causing any issues between Collaborator B and all our mutual friends (we run in the same circles).   

This was a dream project of mine (and, by extension, friend group) and I’m so upset it had to come to this. Fuck me. I feel so alone. Everyone’s better off without me. I just want to disappear.

18358,1i5lgip,post,"I, 19F, recently deleted Tinder because I got addicted.","I am not ugly— I have good and bad angles(I only posted the good angled photos). So I got a lot of attention with absolutely no desire to meet people or date. I’m honestly afraid of doing anything with boys I meet online. I don’t know what their intentions are or what will happen, that may be a fault of my headspace but that’s just where I am right now. 
I’m also really afraid that they will think my face or body is not what they thought I would be like, though I’m not overweight I have deep insecurities about my appearance and body composition. 
I’m definitely not the most gorgeous girl ever but I deeply feel that people on dating apps want someone who looks generic and sexy. I can be that if I try with every cell in my body, but naturally I’m just an average girl who sometimes dresses masc too, i don’t wanna be on a pedestal, but i hate feeling like I am not worth the attention if Im not some hot sexy woman. I just want a connection that’s more than a sexual thing. 
This whole online dating thing just got me reflecting on life, something I never want is a hookup and I never intend to do it. I just want a meaningful relationship that offers me more than I can give myself. I find myself matching my with attractive people, but never someone I find attractive. 
Meeting someone online requires so much precision and commitment, how do you even know there’s chemistry without talking in person or over the phone?
Well, I deleted it and also deleted social media a few months ago, I think it’s part of my social media riddance. I think it will be good to not talk to random boys online😭.

It’s not for everyone, and for most people using it; it’s for hookups.
Goodbye online dating I will not miss you.
(Also please feel free to analyze me and let me know if any observations come up!!? Ty)","I, 19F, recently deleted Tinder because I got addicted.

I don't know if it's just a thing with people that surround me or if it's common, but from what I've heard, after a person dies, it's rare to dream with them. That's not the case for me though. I'm 19, oldest sibling, and I constantly dream with my parents. They passed in an accident almost 4 years ago. Last night I had a dream with my mom, so that's why I felt like sharing. I don't know why, usually, the times I dream with my parents they're either divorced or widowed, cause they were happily inlove until their last breaths, not even death could tesr them appart. But it's so messed up for me (like duh) but it's confusing is what I mean. I'll wake up and remember I can't go and hug either of them, they're gone and it's been that way for years. O don't know how to deal with this, but I just wanted to get it out. I genuinely hate dreaming with them, cause not a single time has it felt fulfilling in any way.

18362,1i5kjuf,post,My family is so toxic but I don’t want it to end,"Pretty much what’s written on the tin. I can’t help but feel like everything is my fault. Just for being born, I’ve trapped my poor mother in a living hell, and I’ve brought my siblings into this nightmare. 
My first vivid nightmare I can remember was when I was around 6, and I remember dreaming my dad shot my mum dead. I was hid under the dinner table, watching them scream and scream until there was a big bang. That image is still so fresh in my brain, and I feel myself brought back to that moment every time I hear them fight. 
They have good times, but then they have these long periods of time where they’re not talking to each other and constantly fighting. 
When I was 12 I went home early on Christmas Day because I wasn’t feeling well. When everyone else came home, my dad was drunk off his tits and was giving my brother (10 at the time) a lot of crap about absolutely nothing. He then grabbed my brother by the throat “as a joke”. 
I remember holding my brother’s hand- BEGGING him not to run away, as I sat with my two younger sisters crying in my arms on the stairs. We just sat and cried as we heard screaming and shouting and then finally mum came storming out of the room. She took us all to our Nan’s (dad’s mum’s) house. That Christmas, I spent the night on the floor of my nans lounge room. My friends were texting about presents and dinner and family and fun tween things, while all I could do was cry on the floor. 
Not me or any of my siblings cared much for Christmas ever since. And I now feel sick when I see a bottle of Jack Daniel’s. I can’t even drink without feeling sick. 
The night before my biggest sewing project in all of high school was due, I was sat in the lounge at the big table, finishing off my project. Dad was watching an action movie that was SUUUUPER loud, so I politely asked him if he could “please turn it down a teeny bit?”. 
He proceeded to scream at me and tell me I was a terrible person. This went on to the point where me, my mum, and sisters all went to nans house to escape the screaming and so I could actually finish my project.
I sat in sewing class the next day with my large folder and dress, not one minute of sleep, only JUST stopped crying, and beyond scared to go home. 
He got me a cameo from a drag race queen. I never got an actual apology. 
Since then, I’ve become an adult. I’m now 22, but everything is somehow worse. Because now I FULLY understand what’s going on, and now they are not at all shy about me being a part of it. My dad will drag me into these fights so I can agree with him. Only he’s literally never ONCE been in the right. When you’re the yelling drunken violent man, you’re not in the right. But he takes me in these dumb circles in conversation until one of us gives up. But sometimes he gets MORE mad at what I have to say. 
He has threatened to hit me more times than I can count- one time even walking towards me with a raised fist. He was stopped by my mum, as she used her whole body to keep him from me. I will never forget the look in his eyes. 

I’ve tried to get something done about this for years. I’ve BEGGED my nan for help. She’s told me more times than I could count that she will always help…. But I can’t think of ONE time she actually held him accountable for ANYTHING. She’ll make excuses after excuse for him, and tell us it’s somehow OUR fault cuz he works so hard. I never ever EVER ASKED TO BE BORN
but I feel like he hates me so much for that.

I’m now in my own relationship, and I’m finding out just how insanely hard it is to exist in a happy healthy relationship when you’ve never had that modeled for you. It’s so frightening. He asks me how I’m really feeling, and every survivor instinct in me tells me to shut up and not talk to my sweet loving boyfriend. My brain tells me he’ll switch and yell and scream and kill me or something. 

I’m a shell of a person, with very very poor communication skills and a crippling fear of loud noises. Now, whenever I hear literally ANYONE raise their voice, I go into a panic. And I can see that my poor mum is in a much worse state. 

My parents have been fighting my entire life, and they definitely DONT belong together. 

But why is that the worst thing I’ve ever written ?? Why am I crying ?? Why do I want this life for me? And my mum? Why is this the only stable thing in my life?? It’s not even slightly stable. This is hell. Why don’t I want to leave ? Why am I so scared?? Why do I love my dad so so much??? Why do I care how he feels?? What is the matter with me? 

Why do I want my toxic, broken family to stay together ?

Why do I want my toxic, broken family to stay together ?

18364,1i5kcj6,post,My first love was my rapist,"When I was around 6 or 7, my mom decided to go back to work again after years of being a housewife and asked her best friend to help drop me off at school. In the car was her son, Jaime. It was a private school in London, and in the car, it was just me, Jaime (who was in 6th or 7th grade), the chauffeur, and a “guardian” (not Jaime's mum) who signed us out of school. Mind you, they were all men; I was the only girl. Note: Jaime was my mom’s godson.



He used to tease me, always making fun of my shoes, telling me I should wear lace-ups instead of buckles, and change how I styled my uniform or my hair. He would tell me I should start shaving my armpit(I was like 7). He would often make then funny, now weird, insinuations about sex with girls in his grade. I found this amazing, cause it was like he was teaching me something new. Once, after dropping me off, he asked to come into my house because he had nothing to do. I obviously didn’t have a choice, so I let him in. He insulted my piano, saying it was cheap plastic compared to the wood one at his house. I was devastated and stopped playing piano for a long time after that.



Jaime was also really controlling. He’d make me say hurtful things to the chauffeur and the guardian. I don’t remember exactly what I said, but once, I saw the chauffeur cry because of something Jaime made me say to him. Jaime would get aggressive too. He demanded that I greet him every time we got into the car after school. Once, I mistakenly called him by his full name instead of his nickname, “Jayjay.” He slapped me across the face, hard. The two men in the car did nothing. Jaime panicked, trying to clean up the mark before I got home, but my nanny saw it. Everyone knew Jaime hit me, but nothing happened. No one said or did anything.



One day in the car, Jaime pulled the blinds up that separated the passengers from the driver's seat and asked me if I wanted to take a nap. He would always asks me this sometimes, especially when I looked tired. He then started playing with my hair. Then, slowly, he went between my thighs and started touching me a lot, then you know(the deed). I don't remember what happened after that because I blacked out, but he also touched and smelt my armpit, a\*s and vagina multiple times. Later my mum called me to her room and asked me if Jaime did what he did I lied but she kept on asking me so I told her the truth. She said I shouldn't ALLOW him to touch me again. I was so confused because if i stopped him, or ""woke up"" jaime would have slapped me on the cheek. And my mum wouldn't have done anything because that is her best friend's son.



On the other hand, Jaime was the only person who gave me attention. My parents were often absent(I know right housewife mum?), but Jaime helped me with my homework, made sure I ate when I was sick and checked on me in school. I even had a crush on him, despite everything. I feel this is a serious part, anytime I was sick him and his mum will come to my class pick me up, take me home and cook my favourite meal for me. Jaime would often buy me snacks or food because my parents forgot to tell my nanny or something. We would listen to music, dance, sing and vibe. He would often make trips to my class to check up on me during school. It also felt like I was part of an inside joke anytime we talked because he was older and everything, and he would tell me about things. And it didn't hurt to have a grade 7 friend in grade 1; it made me seem cool, especially when people knew we rode together(he was pretty popular). People respected me more, and I got more clout; not to self-glaze, but I knew I was attractive, so people didn't hit on me because they knew Jaime was very protective of me and had anger issues.  But the moment I did anything to anger him, he beat me immediately.



Present Day:



I’m 16 now, and it wasn’t until last year that I realized Jaime’s behavior was abusive. I learned that word when a friend of mine went through something similar, and it clicked. I always knew what happened was wrong, but I never labeled it as abuse or r\*pe until then.



Jaime, now 22, is living his best life. He just graduated from law school, works with his dad, drives an Audi, and has a beautiful girlfriend. My family still talks about how “mature” and “amazing” he is. My brothers still go clubbing with him, saying he’s the best. Everytime everyone is always talking about Jaime, no one acts like he did anything to me. 



I used to fantasize about marrying him, thinking my parents would love that because he’s successful and “perfect.” I still think about him every day, wondering if he thinks about me. I still like him. I still go out to dinner with his mom when she visits America, and she buys me presents. My mom and hers are still best friends, and we do charity work together. But I haven’t spoken to Jaime since then, and I wonder if he ever thinks about me the way I think about him. Maybe the appeal is that he is richer than me, idk. Because deep down I know Jaime was still my first love, and i will probably marry him till this day.

18365,1i5kb94,post,I hate being a human,"This might sound weird but I feel like being a human is like being part of the largest criminal organization in the world. I’m speaking from an ecological and environmental point of view. We humans were put here to live and thrive in harmony with nature but we’re literally raping it instead. The earth is being raped in such a manner that is just depressing to me. Almost every single species of large carnivore and herbivore are endangered. Sharks are being hunted for their fins and rhinos are basically extinct because half the world is too stupid to realize that FUCKING SHARK FINS AND RHINO HORNS DONT CURE DISEASE. The UN estimates that up to 150 unique species go extinct every day. That’s almost 55,000 every year. And what are we doing about it you ask? We are exponentially increasing the rate at which we shit carbon into the atmosphere and raze the fucking Amazon. For the first time in basically all of recorded history the amazon rainforest expelled more CO2 than it absorbed recently. People might say that humans actually help the environment where we can but that’s misguided; what problem have humans “solved” that we didn’t cause first? NONE. There are fucking tiger farms in china. Humans are a cancer on this earth and we don’t deserve to share with the other organisms. I can’t wait for all of us to die in category 5 hurricanes so biodiversity can finally recover. It literally took humans 150 years to rip a massive chunk of the biodiversity that this planet has been building for fucking billions of years. Let the ocean rise I say.

We've had ups and downs but we got through it all together. Our communication has improved over the course of our relationship and I am finally starting to be comfortable with myself and life in general. I love my husband dearly and don't want to change anything about our relationship. However I just for the life of me can't stop the emotions I feel just being around a particular colleague. 

I want to be clear, I don't want to progress anything with this colleague. They are also happily married and have no interest in me. I deeply admire this colleague and appreciate working with them (this part I am fine with). However I just can't stop thinking about them. The worst part is I sometimes get butterflies in my stomach when they are in my vicinity and I can't stop feeling this way, my heart feels faint and I get so nervous. Every time I see them in passing I swoon internally. I look forward to going to work everyday because I know they will be around, even if I don't interact with them it's enough to keep me happy. Even the most minor interactions with that colleague will preoccupy my thoughts for days. I count the days until the next meeting I am in where they will be present.

My feelings for my partner has not changed, I enjoy their company, the conversations we have, I also find them more attractive than ever. I have been beating myself up emotionally for having these feelings and I have talked to my partner about the admiration I feel for this colleague and it has helped considerably.

I just wish I could stop whatever this is and feel sane again.","I developed feelings for a colleague even though I'm happily married I've been with my partner for 8 years, married for 3.

I don’t mean physical  health wise. I mean mentally. I feel like pulling myself up again just to be a barely functioning adult is pointless. I usually have a positive/ growth mindset so my goal has always been to try to improve my  mental health by taking appropriate measures and putting in the effort. I’m starting to grow tired of it and I think I’m close to giving up, again. 

I hate this point because I know that I’m likely not thinking rational when I go through these stages of feeling absolutely miserable all day every day for no reason, but I can’t help but feel like the points I raise aren’t completely insane. 
1. I’m emotionally unstable and it take SO MUCH EGFORT 24/7 just to manage myself it’s like talking to a literal child but imagine that’s your head controlling you and you have to fight it somehow 😭
2. I’ve dropped everything that’s good for me during these phases and other than my boyfriend I don’t have any real reason to want to stick around other than disappointing the people I love.
3. I have so many triggers that EVEN when I’m doing great and managing them it’s a job 24/7 and WHY CANT I just function at least 10% better. Why does the upset and hurt feelings actually HURT my chest. Why can’t I stop it? I’ve tried almost anything to work around it, distract from it, cope in better ways, work with myself, talking to myself like a child so that I’m being really compassionate to myself. 
4. I always end up at this point again, no matter how much “progress” I made whilst I was feeling good. It’s like I’m back at square one. I’ve been “thrown in the hole again, with broken bones and no way out” as I describe it. The progress is always tiny . And yes, I affirm myself and try my hardest yo encourage my brain to learn healthier coping, neural pathways, habits, etc. But I end up here, lonely, miserable, afraid like a little child. And I start to get really frustrated as you can tell (I’m venting on Reddit ffs) I’ve been doing so much work on myself my head is like an overheating computer 24/7. And I can’t stop or I end up here, and when I run out of steam, I end up here. Sometimes I get “chilled” good stages of mental health but I end up disassociating and losing myself and before I know it, I’m right. Back. Here. 
I know I’m only 19. But I’m growing so tired of the cycle. And I’m trying so hard to be better, so I can actually do something with my life. I don’t want to anymore. Don’t worry about me doing anything rash, I have no way of achieving  an “unaliving” as my family knows and has taken away basically most ways for me to do it. I can’t even be bothered for anything let alone get tf up to plan out an elaborate plan blah blah blah . I just can’t. It’s burn out misery & anguish , then hyperactivity, hyper fixation and obsession, and repeat the cycle. When does it end. It doesn’t.

I know I’m only 19. But I’m growing so tired of the cycle. And I’m trying so hard to be better, so I can actually do something with my life. I don’t want to anymore. Don’t worry about me doing anything rash, I have no way of achieving  an “unaliving” as my family knows and has taken away basically most ways for me to do it. I can’t even be bothered for anything let alone get tf up to plan out an elaborate plan blah blah blah . I just can’t. It’s burn out misery & anguish , then hyperactivity, hyper fixation and obsession, and repeat the cycle. When does it end. It doesn’t.

18371,1i5jp58,post,Bawled my eyes out in public over an old person's death (+thoughts),"I realised there was nobody I could rant to about this, so I came here for this one purpose.

I have been working at a nursery home for the past three years, caring for just about over 80 elderly people. I'm trilingual, so I have been able to connect with most of them beyond basic communication and they appreciate having someone to talk to in their mother tongue. As a 23-year-old, dealing with death is something I had never experienced prior to this job, and it took a little getting used to. Some deaths would be unexpected, others shocking, but most of them we'd see them coming, especially from residents in modified textured diets and fluids, or those visiting the hospital frequently. I'd tear up here and there, but I moved on.

So far there hasn't been a death that impacted me as much as the most recent one did- which was today. 

I had a day off so I went to buy some books at the local store and generally thought the day would be totally boring and normal. While I was checking out, I got a call from a friend from work, which I ignored until I was done. When I called her back, the first thing she told me was that this old person had died. She thought I'd want to know because of how much time I liked spending with him. She kept talking, she even changed the subject to work gossip, but I felt something snap, and I was tearing up and holding my hand over my mouth to muffle any cries within seconds. I was stuck there and didn't care to listen to anything anymore; I told her ""You killed me right now"" and she said that's life, you don't know when it's coming for you... Outside the store I felt as if everyone's eyes were on me, but I couldn't stop, I didn't feel embarrassed. I felt the need not just to mourn but to weep like never before. I just stood there listening but not listening to her until we hung up. As if I'd lost my own grandparent or worse.

I don't know what shocked me more, the fact that on Saturday I spoke to this person and laughed and said goodbye, or that on Sunday he was taken to the hospital, which was peculiar since he was the paragon of health, probably in the best condition out of everyone there in their early 80s, and today he was just... gone. Others that used to spent time with him had passed not long ago, but they had dementia or kidney problems, so although we were sad to lose them, we knew they were suffering and that it was for the best. Now it was just him and I left on the radio area of the huge dining room all of us used to sit and talk or watch TV; so much commotion, so much noise and laughter... it ceased within months, one by one leaving us. 

But him, I cared for him more than the rest because he came from the same small town as me and we'd listen to morning prayer on the radio every morning. He would ask about my studies, about our town, my family; he would tell me about his family, his grandkids, and tell me he was grateful to have me. Losing him makes me feel empty. Like I'm going to lose everyone I care about at work and then in life, and how they can be gone just like that out of nowhere. I can't believe he won't be there tomorrow, I can't believe he's not breathing, I can't believe it ended for him like that.

I want to speak with his family, ask if I could attend the funeral that'll be in a few days from now, but I'm scared it'll look weird if someone like me is seen crying in church, when all his family and grandkids who knew him their whole lives may be there, potentially without shedding tears, as I only recall one of his daughters visiting him on a regular basis compared to the rest. And I'm not even sure if going will give me closure, he won't know I went, he won't hear me, I just want to crawl to a corner and cry bitterly.

I took the bus home, slowly dragging my body back, and now have no plans for the rest of the day other than just... mourn and mumble that I can't believe it and feel sick to my stomach.","Bawled my eyes out in public over an old person's death (+thoughts) I realised there was nobody I could rant to about this, so I came here for this one purpose.

Eventually, I was invited to some of my internet friends’ Discord calls, and I played games with them. But I couldn’t join in on the conversation because I didn’t know what to say.

18373,1i5jjsd,post,I walked out with a free haircut today because the hair dresser went against my wishes and I had video proof of it on my phone. ,"I had hair long enough to touch the top of my butt. I took pictures of it, straightened, before the appointment. I discreetly recorded me explaining to my hair dresser that I only want 2 inches trimmed off. She tried to sell me on cutting more because it looks “dead”. I firmly and politely declined and said I only want 2 inches trimmed. After the cut, she says “I may have went a liiiiiiittle over 2 inches but LoOk hOw HeALtHy iT LoOkS”… this girl tried to act slick acting like it was a half inch over, but she took a whole 5 and a half inches off. 

I just asked for the manager. She has a melt down to the manager in the corner of the salon. Manager and hairdresser came over. I asked to speak with manager in private. Hair dresser walks away in shame. I explain to manager what I asked for, showed him the before pictures of my hair, showed him the video proof of what I asked the hair dresser to do, showed him timestamps on both so they know it’s legit. Manager profusely apologized, said I didn’t have to pay them a dime for this appointment, offered a discount on whatever next appointment I book with them, if I decide to book with them…

This happens to me usually 1 out of 3 times every time I go to get my hair trimmed, a hair dresser will cut way more than I asked for. I move around a lot because well that’s a whole other story I’m not gonna get into, but point is I never see the same hair dresser to trim my hair. And I do my research and pick the best hair dresser in whatever area I’m in at the time, no fresh babies. This woman knew what she was doing, she knew how much she was taking off and knew it was out of my boundaries…

At this rate, since this happens to me more than it should, I’m doing this every time I get my hair trimmed. Taking video proof of what I asked for and proving I got screwed over if and when I do. I don’t give a f*** how many free haircuts I get and how many of them get fired. I’m tired of y’all breaching the verbal contract because you think you know what’s best for me. I feel zero guilt.

18374,1i5jaj8,post,Just Want to Talk about my Parents Fighting,"Let me preface by saying that my (20M) parents always had a rough marriage even before I was born. My mom married my dad to escape the problems she had in her home country but it was rushed for her and she had issues with adjusting. She also has PTSD from a very traumatic childhood which was triggered by the behavior of my dad's family. She thought having a child would fix it, but she suffered from postpartum which led to suicide attempts. She also said she suffered physical abuse from my dad. My parents would have divorced a long time ago but they have stayed together for me.

Over the past few years, their fights have gotten worse and impacting me. It does not happen everyday, but maybe once a week or every few weeks. It often involves a lot of shouting and I have to mediate it, otherwise it will become worse. I wanted to talk about a particular fight that happened last month:

My mom was doing a police check and they couldn't find a credit score for her. She could not login to the joint bank account since she had not activated a pin. She also realized she was an additional cardholder on the credit cards, which meant she was not accumulating a credit score.

My mom became angry at my dad (who has full control over the finances) and thought that she had no access to the bank accounts. She also felt betrayed, since she sacrificed a lot of money for the wedding.

However, my dad kept telling her it was an error and they just needed to call the bank to login to the accounts. She also kept showing her proof of a credit score from another account (I'm not sure which one), but my mom would not believe him. My mom ended up being pre-approved for a credit card and it turns out there was just an error in the system.

There was a lot of shouting up to this point, but then it became worse and my mom just started to pack a suitcase and try to leave. I think she was under a lot of stress since she was having issues with sharing responsibilities with my dad. She just started talking uncontrollably about all the trauma from the marriage and was hyperventilating. My dad was trying to block her from leaving and eventually she calmed down.

But since this fight triggered my mom's PTSD, she had a nightmare and screamed for 5 straight minutes and I had to comfort her.

This event was very traumatic and I wanted to talk about how it affected me:

1. I sometimes just randomly think about my mom's screaming from her nightmare especially at night or if I am siting in the living room, which is where I heard it. It causes me to shiver and feel scared.
2. After the argument, my dad revealed his side of the story. He said that he showed my mom around and helped her adjust but it was just one incident where she could not find something and he did not know. He also said my mom would not take medication after her postpartum (even when the doctor was begging her) and she was acting violently towards him so he had to use force as defense and did not intentionally abuse her.
3. When my parents had another argument after this, I became really scared when waking up and was sweating. I am always on edge now about another fight.

My parents agreed to separate after this fight and next year, they plan to fully renovate the basement. One person will live there, the other person upstairs. I'm not sure if it is worth it for me to move out then?

I can't talk to my parents about this because they are already stressed out. I was also having some anxiety problems last year due to the fighting and after I started talking to a counsellor, my mom was arguing about how they failed to make the home environment safe.

I really want to talk to my counsellor about this, but I don't know how to see him without my parents knowing, since he only does virtual appointments at night when I am at home. I also pay him through credit card, which my parents track.","Just Want to Talk about my Parents Fighting Let me preface by saying that my (20M) parents always had a rough marriage even before I was born.

18379,1i5ixye,post,"I’m ending it, and I feel like a massive asshole.","In college, I started dating a girl I knew from high school who always had a crush on me. At first it felt casual, and I figured I could just go along with it. Somewhere along the way I got comfortable, and before I even realized it, four years had gone by. I cared about her, but it wasn't 100% reciprocated, and I should’ve been honest about that a long time ago.

Now. I’m finally ending it. I’m in the middle of it right now. It hurts a LOT - but I know it’s hurting her even more. On top of that, we live together, which just makes everything so much more difficult.

I feel like such a massive asshole. A soul as sweet as her deserved to spend those years with someone who truly wanted to be with her, someone who saw her as “the one.” Instead, I just coasted on autopilot, wasting both of our time because I was too scared to face the truth.

The emotional turmoil has been overwhelming. Honestly, I’ve been grasping at anything to keep myself from spiraling. For a while, I even had AI help me with some mind-bending physics ... stuff — trying to do the impossible, in more ways than one. And I've just been drowning myself in work.

Recently I broke down and told my mom. She gave me some of the best advice I’ve ever gotten, and it helped me see things more clearly. If anyone else is in a similar situation, I can’t recommend enough reaching out to someone close for support. It’s hard to admit when you’ve messed up, but it feels a little less impossible when someone who cares about you is there to listen.

What makes this even harder is that there was someone else I really cared about all along—the one I never had the courage to pursue. She’s moved on now, and I can’t help but think about how I threw away any chance I might’ve had with her because I stayed stuck in something I wasn’t sure about.

I don’t know why I’m putting this out there. Maybe I just need to say it to someone. I wasn’t honest with myself or the people around me for so long, and now I’m sitting in the mess I made, trying to figure out how to move forward without making the same mistakes.

18381,1i5inz2,post,I'm (28F) crushing on my much older friend (42M). What the heck?!,"A couple years ago, I took night classes at the local community college – photography, just for fun, something to do. I met this guy there. We hit it off and started taking photo walks together, critiquing each other's pics, that sort of thing. Eventually we started hanging out outside of photography stuff, grabbing drinks or dinner after work. We were both happily in long-term relationships and would often invite our partners. Everyone got along and was chill, we had fun.

Well, since then, both our relationships have ended and I've realized I have a crush on my friend. Not just a little one either. You guys, I don't want to just sleep with him. I want to hold him, cook for him, comfort him after a tough day at the office... It's almost ridiculous. Nobody could be more surprised than me. I've never been with someone more than 4 years older than me! But he's such a sweetheart. We share hobbies (even beyond photography!) and care about the same things – sports, music, you name it. One of the most awkward people I know, but now it's endearing. 

Once, recently, I found myself lightly flirting with him while we were hanging out. I'm shy so I was surprised I had it in me. The next time we hung out, well, I'm pretty sure he flirted back. I feel like the allegorical dog who caught the car! 

Now I'm running circles in my head to figure out what to do next. I'm scared that because of the age gap, he'll assume I'm only interested in his body, or worse, his wallet. I don't think I act like that, but I'm not stupid, I know the stereotypes. I wish there was a way to flirt that said, loud and clear, ""I really, really like you in an I-want-to-make-you-hot-cocoa-and-cuddle way, so if you just want FWB, please spare me now."" Wish me luck, I guess. What a crazy rollercoaster life is!","I'm (28F) crushing on my much older friend (42M). What the heck?!

18387,1i5i5ky,post,Is my marriage over?,"I (m38) think my marriage to my husband (m37) may be over.
All I ever seem to do is fix things, sort things and parent him.
He has put us in some predicaments that I have had to rectify numerous times and often at great financial cost.

I absolutely love my husband with all I have, but all I have isn't enough.
He is disinterested in me. I have lost weight, gained weight, shaved my hair off, changed the way I dress to a style I know he likes.....a lot. Still nothing.
I have done things I've never wanted to do - because he likes them and I just wanted some intimacy with him. Things have been tried - yet as soon as he is sorted that's it, he rushes to the bathroom and showers and then goes downstairs. To say I feel used is an understatement.

Last year we had a rare night out whilst I had driven hundreds of miles to do something for his late father, died when he was 21. I had to leave the bar as they had no card payment, I was gone maybe 15 mins to find a cashpoint and returned. He was topless, and he then snogged another man in front of me. 
I was cool about it - I thought he wanted the man to join....and I just wanted my husband to show some attention to me in the bedroom so we started to go back, I'm partially deaf- my husband had I thought gone back to get this man- and had apparently called my name but I hadn't heard. I didn't hear him until he started screaming calling me a selfish c*unt, how rude I was and how I've been rude.

I got back to the hotel got my keys and was proceeding to drive back home.
I panicked and turned out of the car park where he couldn't see and parked up, I shouldn't have got in that car and am still ashamed I did that.
I went back the next day and told him he was bang out of order, to call me selfish when I had been driving for a couple of days to ensure he had a good time and could honour his father and get things off his chest, yet he had humiliated me numerous times, had me walking round - I'm disabled and can go for a bit but he had pushed me beyond my abilities but as this meant a lot I just took more painkillers and carried on. Told him he had snogged someone else in front of me and then shrugged, that this was all being done the weekend of Father's Day - my father had been killed months prior so this was my first Father's Day without him and yet I was putting all my feelings aside to do this for his dad as I know my dads death had affected him. And of course he remembered nothing and blamed vodka - I told him that was the biggest load of ahot, he clearly felt and meant what he said.

Still I forgave him and tried again to make things better at home.

He does very little at home apart from
Eat and sleep, snoring and refusing to use his cPap machine so moans about being tired.

I've facilitated his dieting - and he binges at work, I spent the meagre amount I got after my father passed - I ensured my siblings and the grandkids were financially sorted and solicitor fees paid so I had enough to buy one last Xmas present and maybe a birthday present - but the money was spent on dieting, getting the things he needed to keep him on track. That was what I wasted my money on, my husband and his lack of effort.

I've told him numerous times that his lack of effort and constant lack of anything- he never wants to do anything, I've had to bully him into taking his driving lessons - which I have given him money for on numerous occasions and he has spent it on shit- and can show nothing for it.
And he promises to change and it lasts a few weeks tops.

Well this year I was picking up his shit again because he's too bone idle to put rubbish in the bin I've put next to his side of the bed. It was a letter about the loan he had taken out .....after my father died. At the time I was selling things and cashing in anything I could to afford solicitors for my fathers case, and to keep the car running andnpetrol to keep travelling to where my fathers case lived to deal with his case. I also had to find the money to pay for a memorial for my father, and a small get together with some family and friends. Meanwhile my husband had taken out a loan for thousands of pounds.....and said he wasn't even sure what he had spent any of it on.

I think that angered me more than anything- he watched me struggle and panic, my hair fall out from the stress of keeping our finances inline and sorting all this other stuff and he said nothing and had nothing to show, he just wasted it. Now he's been short for some time financially so I've picked up the slack.....we went 18 months where I paid for everything so he could clear debts he had before we were together- he cleared them.

Now he's done this and I wasn't even a thought.
Only once he was found out due to his own laziness - and obviously the deceit has left a bad taste in my mouth, the lying and not even faltering - and then he felt soo guilty and it was making him ill, he was upset after my dad was killed, it made him remember his dad and blah blah blah, then he told a friend he tried to kill himself.....has never told me to this day, because he walked out the house and remained out - sneaking back at some point whilst I was cleaning his latest mess.
He was in the bedroom and remained there all night, said absolutely nothing and didn't even answer his phone when I called to see where exactly he was as it was now late and I was panicking.....I phoned friends and only then did I realise he had snitch back in at some point and just ignored me.

Things carried on, I told him I wouldn't pay a penny toward his debt - I was covering other debts - car etc.

We carried on - then last month I had to have an operation on my leg.
I wasn't able to drive but he had been taking lessons and was test ready. He is insured in the car so we went out with him driving. He ignored everything and didn't even answer what he wanted, I told him it would be a no agai for him driving but he begged for another shot, it was atrocious again but I decided that would be that, yet upon getting on the drive his arrogance got the better of him and he reversed at speed into the bins in front of the house, he has damaged the car, bins and the already damaged front wall has been damaged further.
I didn't say anything- I think it wa pretty clear he had fucked up .....yet he ignored me for two days. He made no attempt to fix the damage he had caused to the car, bins or wall.
He refused to take the dogs out for a walk and toilet so was quite happy to let me (bandaged from foot to groin) take the dogs for a walk - only short distance but still - whilst I can just about walk myself, and he said nothing, didn't even acknowledge me.
He ignored me for yet another day - and I have said absolutely nothing about the car, it was an accident and I didn't want it to ruin his driving lessons, accidents happen after all.
Well I got some clothes and told him I was leaving, and I don't see a way forward from this. Once again he makes an issue and then sulks and ignores me for his mistake. I told him he was a shit driver and shouldn't be on the road as his arrogance and know it all attitude overrides common sense and listening abilities. I felt bad after but oh well, I said it.
I then got in the car and drove to a local service station and slept in the car, it snowed so I really didn't want to go any further and was hoping it would melt so I could drive in the morning.
There was no text from him, I sent a message with how to start proceeding with a divorce and said that it, I've said numerous times I'm not doing this alone and I'm sick of walking in wggshells and then having him say he needs to talk to someone as a way to get out of repercussions - it's a pattern and his words are meaningless at that stage.

I drove back next day and spoke to him and he said he had ignored me to let me cool off.....so I asked what did I say that made him think I needed to cool off, and it was because after he hit the bins and wall I got out quickly to check the wall was still where it should be.....

It's like gaslighting, I think that's right anyway.

Somehow any mistake is mine, any issue always relates back to his childhood and how his parents have affected him. And I am very sympathetic to that, and I've more than made allowance for that but at some point he needs to be responsible for his own actions, he knows how it affected him as a child and he's here treating me the way he knows is wrong....but he's gonna change.

3 weeks later and we are back here again. No effort, and entire weekend just spent sleeping, eating or watching tv, complaining hes cold. Because he forced us out of a warm, dry place into the pot one we are in because he didn't like a neighbour, now we have a property that leaking, costs a fortune to heat because of damp, blown windows, one small radiator to heat off of downstairs, a conservatory that is not only blown but letting in cold air constantly as it's falling away from the wall of the kitchen and issues he won't report to the landlord, and a repair man I arranged via the landlord hwho
Never shows up and he won't ring to tell them he never showed up, or finished repairs last summer.....that I've had to pay to have sorted again.

There's no effort on his part, I have exhausted everything I can think of to make this work, talking, therapy, trying to arrange things and dates and he still can't be bothered.
I'm not willing to change myself any longer or continue to allow myself to feel repugnant because I'm beating a dead horse who's happy to be parented but can't be bothered to do anything for himself.
I do think he loves me but he doesn't respect me, and I keep allowing this so I've not been respecting myself....I think it's over isn't it?
","Is my marriage over? I (m38) think my marriage to my husband (m37) may be over.
All I ever seem to do is fix things, sort things and parent him.
He has put us in some predicaments that I have had to rectify numerous times and often at great financial cost.

I absolutely love my husband with all I have, but all I have isn't enough.
He is disinterested in me. I have lost weight, gained weight, shaved my hair off, changed the way I dress to a style I know he likes.....a lot. Still nothing.
I have done things I've never wanted to do - because he likes them and I just wanted some intimacy with him. Things have been tried - yet as soon as he is sorted that's it, he rushes to the bathroom and showers and then goes downstairs. To say I feel used is an understatement.

Last year we had a rare night out whilst I had driven hundreds of miles to do something for his late father, died when he was 21. I had to leave the bar as they had no card payment, I was gone maybe 15 mins to find a cashpoint and returned. He was topless, and he then snogged another man in front of me. 
I was cool about it - I thought he wanted the man to join....and I just wanted my husband to show some attention to me in the bedroom so we started to go back, I'm partially deaf- my husband had I thought gone back to get this man- and had apparently called my name but I hadn't heard. I didn't hear him until he started screaming calling me a selfish c*unt, how rude I was and how I've been rude.

I got back to the hotel got my keys and was proceeding to drive back home.
I panicked and turned out of the car park where he couldn't see and parked up, I shouldn't have got in that car and am still ashamed I did that.
I went back the next day and told him he was bang out of order, to call me selfish when I had been driving for a couple of days to ensure he had a good time and could honour his father and get things off his chest, yet he had humiliated me numerous times, had me walking round - I'm disabled and can go for a bit but he had pushed me beyond my abilities but as this meant a lot I just took more painkillers and carried on. Told him he had snogged someone else in front of me and then shrugged, that this was all being done the weekend of Father's Day - my father had been killed months prior so this was my first Father's Day without him and yet I was putting all my feelings aside to do this for his dad as I know my dads death had affected him. And of course he remembered nothing and blamed vodka - I told him that was the biggest load of ahot, he clearly felt and meant what he said.

Still I forgave him and tried again to make things better at home.

He does very little at home apart from
Eat and sleep, snoring and refusing to use his cPap machine so moans about being tired.

I've facilitated his dieting - and he binges at work, I spent the meagre amount I got after my father passed - I ensured my siblings and the grandkids were financially sorted and solicitor fees paid so I had enough to buy one last Xmas present and maybe a birthday present - but the money was spent on dieting, getting the things he needed to keep him on track. That was what I wasted my money on, my husband and his lack of effort.

I've told him numerous times that his lack of effort and constant lack of anything- he never wants to do anything, I've had to bully him into taking his driving lessons - which I have given him money for on numerous occasions and he has spent it on shit- and can show nothing for it.
And he promises to change and it lasts a few weeks tops.

Well this year I was picking up his shit again because he's too bone idle to put rubbish in the bin I've put next to his side of the bed. It was a letter about the loan he had taken out .....after my father died. At the time I was selling things and cashing in anything I could to afford solicitors for my fathers case, and to keep the car running andnpetrol to keep travelling to where my fathers case lived to deal with his case. I also had to find the money to pay for a memorial for my father, and a small get together with some family and friends. Meanwhile my husband had taken out a loan for thousands of pounds.....and said he wasn't even sure what he had spent any of it on.

I think that angered me more than anything- he watched me struggle and panic, my hair fall out from the stress of keeping our finances inline and sorting all this other stuff and he said nothing and had nothing to show, he just wasted it. Now he's been short for some time financially so I've picked up the slack.....we went 18 months where I paid for everything so he could clear debts he had before we were together- he cleared them.

Now he's done this and I wasn't even a thought.
Only once he was found out due to his own laziness - and obviously the deceit has left a bad taste in my mouth, the lying and not even faltering - and then he felt soo guilty and it was making him ill, he was upset after my dad was killed, it made him remember his dad and blah blah blah, then he told a friend he tried to kill himself.....has never told me to this day, because he walked out the house and remained out - sneaking back at some point whilst I was cleaning his latest mess.
He was in the bedroom and remained there all night, said absolutely nothing and didn't even answer his phone when I called to see where exactly he was as it was now late and I was panicking.....I phoned friends and only then did I realise he had snitch back in at some point and just ignored me.

Things carried on, I told him I wouldn't pay a penny toward his debt - I was covering other debts - car etc.

We carried on - then last month I had to have an operation on my leg.
I wasn't able to drive but he had been taking lessons and was test ready. He is insured in the car so we went out with him driving. He ignored everything and didn't even answer what he wanted, I told him it would be a no agai for him driving but he begged for another shot, it was atrocious again but I decided that would be that, yet upon getting on the drive his arrogance got the better of him and he reversed at speed into the bins in front of the house, he has damaged the car, bins and the already damaged front wall has been damaged further.

18388,1i5hqmw,post,Dug my own grave in this relationship,"Big warnings for grey-area sex/rape, transphobia, etc. Long post be warned.

Im aroace but also transgender. If you hate all thise words thats fine but i wont be responding to anyone disputing my existance rn. I basically decided to ""stop"" being aroace in 2020 because it felt like nobody wanted me to be that. I also didnt see it as a viable option for living long term. I am incapable of living without supervision due to health problems, and all of my friends expressed only short term interest in living together. They all want to move in with partners eventually, not that i blame them. That means, practically for me, i have no future or long term goals or plans. If youve been on the internet you know we are a fucking joke to people at best and dont exist at worse, and i got tired of nobody actually caring. So i was freshly grey-asexual and was ready to pretend that it makes me happier to be so.

I got outed in 2020 as well. I was living at home, just graduated school, and my dad pressured me to come out as trans. He and my mom sat down with me and said a bunch of hurtful stuff, and then proceeded to pretend i had never come out. It was awful and i spent most of the year dissociating but keeping up appearances because they said ""other parents would be kicking me out for this"". I was scared theyd kick me out if i wasnt civil so I just quietly faded away as much as i could.

I needed to leave. I got a job and saved up money, but i still needed roommates to make it work. I had one secured, but it was still a lot of money, so I asked my brand new boyfriend if he was interested.

We moved in together, in addition to my friend. It went terribly.

Basically, i did get a fulltime job. Then another - i was stuck doing the lions share of chores for years on end. My friend who i had moved with bailed on the lease, and each roommate after that was hell. They both had adhd and tough lives so I tried to be respectful and forgiving, because my life has been tough and i wanted to not be another enemy. Obviously i should have confronted them but I really really struggle to do that. I have cleaned mold off the shower minutes after coming back from  vacation, scrubbed furiously at messes that werent my own, that were bigger because the people making them would leave them out really long.

Meanwhile, my relationship was going bad and it was all my fault. In addition to needing to talk about cleaning, i was tolerating a ton of stuff that actually annoys me. I was also trying to be helpful but not seeing that help reciporicated, paying for meals and subsidizing bills, because he told me he felt financially trapped (gets a set amt of money from parents for rent and school). I was constantly burning myself out being all hyperfocused on pleasing him but i also hated him for taking up all my energy which is my own fault. He never actually asked me to do any of these things, and it frustrates him that i dont actually help when when he needs it most because im too tired

A few times we definitely did stuff i straight up shouldnt have consented to. i am constantly trying to people please and i have lied to him a lot about always loving the sex. Why? Well, if he breaks up and moves out i am back to living with my parents, which is not an option.

We ended up moving states and into an apartment, just the two of us, but that didnt fix things. Obviously. Because my lack of communication is still there.

I am not fishing for sympathy here. I know i am doing a lot of harm by not communicating. He listens and responds to critiques when i do manage to get them out, but i rarely do so in a proper manner. Naturally, he gets defensive when small things make me talk about other bigger things, and i have a really bad habit of making all of his problems about me. But my brain interprets anger as a threat, and makes me wanna speak up even less. 

I dont have a therapist rn because im broke from the move, but i have been in therapy on and off since the relationship started and increased my meds for my depression, but it hasnt helped. I have tried to help him with his adhd, which is severe enough that i had to argue him into writing one (one!!!) paper to graduate. He was unable to help with the majority of packing for our move as a result, which was incredibly stressful for me. I still have nightmares about not being fully packed when the moving truck arrived and being so embarrassed.

But a lot of that is fixable. What isnt fixable is the sex, and particularly the sex i forced myself to go along with. My body doesnt find sex very fun or interesting and my mind can only get into it under specific kinks. Sex is his special interest so he tries to bond with me through it, but i often push myself past what i personally enjoy because i want to spend time with him. So now i dont even like the sex i did like before. Great job me.

I want to come clean but i cant even tell him when something he says hurts me. We are both autistic and both adhd, but i am traumatized from a lot of other shit and am constantly triggered by his neutral tones and perfectly normal things to say that constantly come off to me as critiques. He is upset that i dont trust him, but i want him to earn my trust, and he still hasnt. 

There isnt a way out of this thst doesnt permanently traumatize him. I would have to say, hey, i just psycologically tortured you by making you read my mind all the time for four years, but you hurt me a lot without knowing it and theres nothing you can do to change that! You might technically have raped me! But worst of all, the worst thing youve ever done to me is express that you cant care for me. Thats something that comes up often. He doesnt know how to help, and cant be the one who cares for me.

I just see no way out at this point. I could break up.. but move back in with my parents and that would be... bad. I am so worried that he will find out everything is a lie.

This post will probably get deleted because my acc is a burner but ah well. Needed to get it out there

Please dont be like me and get into a relationship because you see no other option. Youre just gonna hurt the person youre with :(

But this proves that teeth health is genetic. They are always like “wow you have better hygiene than I usually see, keep up the good work.” I really got lucky.

18393,1i5gtbn,post,I told a guy I like him. ,"I told a guy I like him. I’m a 22F and he is a 27M. 

I get a lot of attention from men and I always blow them off. I’ve never had a boyfriend. Never held hands or kissed a guy, ever. If I really wanted a boyfriend, to hold a guys hand or kiss- I could at any given moment. (I say that very humbly.) I just went on my first date 5 days ago. 

People always say that they can’t wait to meet who I marry b/c they are so curious as to who will “win me over”. I’ve been told “you’re the kind of girl that all guys want, but no one can have.” (Again, I say this humbly) 

I’m very funny (at least people tell me that) & a down to earth kind of girl. I try to be someone that others can always confide in.

It’s not like the men that ask me out are ugly or their personality’s suck but it’s because I don’t like when a guy asks me out but doesn’t know who I am. I have always known whoever I go out on a date with, I want to be friends with them first. 

The real truth as to why I’ve been single this long is that I have trust issues. It’s hard for me to let people in. The other reasons is because I’m so insecure. I get called beautiful everyday by at least one stranger. Consistent stares in public by men and women. Yet I’m still insecure. 

I grew up unattractive. Well, I was beautiful but on the bigger side… so not what most boys wanted. It really messed with my confidence. I’m still a bigger girl but I hold my weight decently. 

I met a guy at the job I just left (of 5 years) and recently just told him I liked him. We went on a date and it went so so well! I was attracted to him because he has such a calm energy. He is handsome, deep voice and is so so funny. He is so quiet though. He knows how to take a joke and how to dish it. We are so similar but also so different. 

I’m afraid that I’m going to self sabotage. I like him a lot but it’s weird to let go and let someone in. 

The other thing is that he has just left me on read for 24 hours after texting almost everyday for about a month. 

I feel like I have to detach because I’m scared of getting hurt. I am almost mad at myself for letting someone in. I could also be jumping the gun and he had something come up. 

I guess we will see. I have no one to talk to about this because I don’t like talking about my feelings.. (go figure lol). 

If you read this, thank you. I love you lol. ","I told a guy I like him.  I told a guy I like him. I’m a 22F and he is a 27M.

18395,1i5gdux,post,I just hate my life rn,"Pretty self explanatory. There’s nothing sensational about my complains but it just ruins my mood a bit more every day that goes by. Just for context I (F28) been dating my bf (M24) since almost half a year and a half and we officially live together since last September (I say officially bc we were all the time together before too, just not in our own apartment). We’re both evolving in an artistic environment, he’s a primarily a musician / producer but he also sings, as for myself my job until now was modeling full time.
Being part of those industries is not an easy ride and since it’s very unstable, I had to take a day job for the first time. My bf has always worked in fast food restaurants besides music, but I’ve never had any professional experience in any field (but modeling) before last summer. I finished high school, but not any of the advanced studies I started. My mom used to be a teacher and has always associated status and studies, needless to say I’m such a disappointment in her eyes. Anyway. I now work 35h per week as a saleswoman in a department store that belongs to a famous retail chain focused mainly on fashion, beauty and home decor. I hate, hate it with my whole heart; the work atmosphere, mentality, petty managers, two faced colleagues, karens or just the job itself. I thought I’d still be able to take modeling contracts during my days off and at the very beginning I did a couple of times but it didn’t last and it’s been months since I didn’t get one. I’m tired (they made us work 40h during BF, Xmas period and now the normal sales) both physically and mentally all the time. All my friends live in other cities and I don’t have time to visit them (nor do they) anymore, so basically besides my bf and sometimes his friends I have no social life of my own and it hurts. I’ve always avoided making connexions with the others outside of work because I KNEW it’d be trouble and guess what ? I was so damn right, that one guy I thought was kind and friendly just wanted to f*ck the hell out of me as soon as he broke up with his gf (who works in the same place as us btw). It just disgusted me of the whole place even more. I feel like I’m spending my whole life in that sh*t hole, surrounded by toxic / bitter people who have nothing better to do than trash talking others (me included) all day long. Even though I’ve always knew I wouldn’t enjoy the « experience », I’ve tried though; tried to be as nice and helpful as I could, bringing food I’ve spent all night cooking and boxes of chocolate… That job is just not made for me and I can’t hide it. It’s been five months and I still suck at most things despite my efforts, and the more I get yelled at the more I lose my grip. You know when they say what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger ? Well, what doesn’t kill me makes me depressed and it doesn’t make me wanna prove anyone wrong either, it just makes me wanna leave but I can’t rn. I feel so stuck… And seeing my friends and their friends still modeling is taking a huge toll on me, especially since can’t nor do I have the motivation to take care about my socials like I used to (colleagues are lurking and as much as they can piss off, I don’t feel like posting like I used to with them watching all the time).
My bf is supportive but ngl, that situation has made our relationship cloudier than before; he’s working mostly at night whether he’s recording or even making pizzas and even though I’ve always been a night owl, our lifestyles are conflicting almost all the time now. He can have up to three sessions per day, last one being from 11PM to 3AM but it’s most likely until 4AM (like he is right now). His studio isn’t fully done so I still can hear everything. After that he often goes out to see his homies and smoke some sh*t / weed (I hate that). In that case he doesn’t come back before 5AM - 6AM. Last year he used to work an insane amount of time but since I was so much more flexible with my schedule we managed to have time to do plenty of stuff together, now the lack of sleep and excesses really caught him up and he’s worn out all the time. I try to be understanding but it irritates me so much that he cares so little about daily chores… If I wasn’t doing the laundry he wouldn’t do it. Same thing when it comes to changing the sheets. When he sweeps the floor (only in the living room / recording studio) he’ll just leave the dirt and dust in a corner and call it a day. He says he’ll do the dishes (mainly his and his clients) but leaves it for days, even weeks in the sink. I usually end up doing it but once I didn’t and let him realized how long it’s been sitting there, there was MOLD. I also had to force him to take showers a few times because he was too lazy to do so, and I’m not even a maniac when it comes to hygiene I just don’t want my man to lay down in the freshly made bed after three days of not showering especially not when he comes back from making food all night… Also he won’t go grocery shopping and if I do (or he) he’ll just let things rot away because he’d rather order - even if I suggest to cook - resulting in us spending a crazy amount on deliveries. I’ve already brought it up to him and he was so defensive, replying that it wasn’t that bad, that he was indeed cleaning and that for most things, he just never had the time, that he’d rather let things accumulate to do it all at once and that he’s focused on things that are way bigger than this…
I don’t think he realizes how much it is for my mental load. Back when I had more time I gladly helped him by doing all the chores (maybe it was a bad idea…) but I can’t anymore, I’m also too tired. We talked about me moving but even though that could be a solution I really don’t want to because if I don’t have him when I come back home I just won’t make it, I’ll feel even more isolated than I currently am and that’s the last thing I want.
I drown my sadness and anxiety in cigarettes and shopping sprees since I feel like my hopes and ambitions are only illusions now, I can’t see the point anymore. So many times I’ve been told it’ll be beneficial to step outside my confort zone but mind you my « confort zone » was not so confortable, in fact it was pretty challenging but at least I loved what I was doing. I’ve never complained while on set, I’ve always worked my ass off to give the best of me even when I slept only a few hours, even if it lasted longer than expected, I put up with the late payments and last minute castings… but this I can’t. Every day at work is a reminder of my failure because I can’t keep up like my pairs and I’m not an intellectual like my mother wanted me to. My bf can’t comprehend why I’m pissed off when there are tobacco crumbs all over and used coffee cups piling up for days. And it makes me sad because I love him so much so does he, but the difficulties we are going through professionally are making our relationship suffer more than it should. I know it’s not that serious compared to other posts I’ve seen here but I really needed to get that off my chest.","I just hate my life rn Pretty self explanatory.

18397,1i5g44w,post,Erasing myself from any photographic memory.,"For the last couple of days, I’ve been carefully deleting and erasing any photographs (and planing to do the same with the printed ones) where im depicted.  

I’ve been struggling with suicidal ideation, for some months, and its been scaling for the last couple of weeks to some levels I’ve never experienced before.  I have a plan, to completely disappear. As if I had never existed. I don’t want my family (wife, daughter) to be left behind and deal with my corpse, since the business of corpse handling and death  is very expensive. 

Back to the main idea, in my self destruct process, im slowly but surely, im taking on the task of deleting and nuking all the pics where I am depicted, something like erasing the memory like in michel grondry’s “eternal sunshine of the spotless mind”. So in the future were im counting on not to be alive, if my family wants to take a look into te past and watch old family photographs, they wont be reminded of me. Or find me. 

As a photographer myself, I really live by and admire  photography power of memory, and how a single photo can trigger so many memories and feelings. So this is an ultimate fuck you to my own philosophy and memory. Im erasing myself from the memory. From time itself. It’s been hard. Really hard, even if I don’t go ahead with my plan of disappearing and dying in the bottom of the sea, this has been  at least a very painful and metaphorical way to die. 
In this hole process I have some rules, if im depicted alongside more people or group photograph, I mask myself as a shadow or blend myself into the background. So im really taking my time, its become a whole project. Although the “benefit” of being a photog, is that im rarely depicted. As for my familys own archives such as icloud photos and such. I have more of a Machiavellian plan, which is to whenever I have the opportunity, go into the devices of my wife and daughter, and erase myself from their devices. I wish I could do the same with my parents and siblings archive, but its not possible and realistic. Probably if I go along with my plan,  I’ll write a letter, and ask them to respect my wishes of erasing any physical or digital photographs of myself. 

As for now, im tired of getting this off my chest.

So in the future were im counting on not to be alive, if my family wants to take a look into te past and watch old family photographs, they wont be reminded of me. Or find me. 

As a photographer myself, I really live by and admire  photography power of memory, and how a single photo can trigger so many memories and feelings. So this is an ultimate fuck you to my own philosophy and memory. Im erasing myself from the memory. From time itself. It’s been hard. Really hard, even if I don’t go ahead with my plan of disappearing and dying in the bottom of the sea, this has been  at least a very painful and metaphorical way to die. 
In this hole process I have some rules, if im depicted alongside more people or group photograph, I mask myself as a shadow or blend myself into the background. So im really taking my time, its become a whole project. Although the “benefit” of being a photog, is that im rarely depicted. As for my familys own archives such as icloud photos and such. I have more of a Machiavellian plan, which is to whenever I have the opportunity, go into the devices of my wife and daughter, and erase myself from their devices. I wish I could do the same with my parents and siblings archive, but its not possible and realistic. Probably if I go along with my plan,  I’ll write a letter, and ask them to respect my wishes of erasing any physical or digital photographs of myself. 

As for now, im tired of getting this off my chest.

18398,1i5fzq1,post,Dead Letter Box,"My Dearest Jeanette,
As I start this letter it has been 11,047 days since you were taken away from me. It seems an unfathomable amount of time has passed and whether it’s been a miracle, blind luck or a guardian angel working overtime that I’ve made it this far. I’m sorry to say that I am more broken, but hiding it very well, than when you found me. I tried to be the person I was when we last saw each other but after learning what happened I had a come apart that lasted for years until I made a friend at work. You would like him, he’s is the brother I should’ve had. He and his wife welcomed me into their family and it’s been that way for the past 29 years.

I’ve often pondered now and in the past what possessed you to approach me and start chatting like we were the best of friends. What was it you saw in me? Was it a need to mend something broken? Unrealized potential? I should’ve asked but was just too amazed to question it and now I’ll never know.

As the years have drug by I wish there was a way to turn back the clock to when we first met and relive every single moment we were together. I want us to lay on the hood of my car and watch the stars and jets land at the base. I want us to slow dance by the headlights and sing your favorite song to you. I want you to tease me for being short and needing to stand on a stool to kiss you. I want to see the sun turning your auburn hair to the color of fresh copper. I want to hold your hand again. I want to hear you say I am yours and you are mine again.

I have been waiting for you to show me any signs from beyond. I know it’s possible, my dad visits every so often. I can tell by the faint odor of cigarette smoke which occasionally wafts through the house. Maybe you’ve been watching and are disappointed with how I’ve become. It’s hard to put on a brave face day after day with all my troubles. It seems the only things keeping me moving forward are my dog and granddaughter. Everything else I couldn’t really care about. I just want you back in my arms if only for a moment.

You always knew how close I kept everything. The only person I could truly express myself was to you, so for me sending this out to the void is a huge step but a recent event reminded me about you and our time together. I’m sorry to say as the years have gone on I don’t think of you as often as I did and it somehow feels as if I’m dishonoring you by beginning to forget. Everyday seems like a constant struggle, especially the past few, but I’ll make it. Even though you’re gone and I regretfully married another, I still love you with all my heart.","Dead Letter Box My Dearest Jeanette,

18399,1i5fywv,post,Well today I think my dreams of a family were shattered.,"I'm 30 m, my girlfriend is 29 both doing pretty well in life we've been dating 5 years and everything is super, she's great, funny, intelligent, beautiful,and everything above that. We were having a face time chat which is what we always do if we don't see eachother because we love eachothers company and we like to just do our things, everything was great.

Untill....
 I told her about a dream I had where i was lying on a bed and she came in lay on top of me and we cuddled then our little girl came up and hugged us both and I thought it was supper cute and sweet.

We don't have any kids but it's been a goal of mine to have kids and she knew this from the start and she was on the fence but She always said she would have them if it ever happened so I thought telling her my dream wouldn't be a problem. 

She got quite after I told her and I asked her what's up. 
She said that I need to chill and keep that to myself. And after a little more talk she told me she doesn't want to have kids. 

My heart broke a little inside when I heard that because my whole life is kids, I'm a teacher and my students love me and I love them but I've always wanted my own kids and  start my own family. I've always been amazing with kids  super caring, supportive and empathetic towards them and the people I love so why not want a family. 

The reason why I feel it's hurting me so much is because I truly felt this girl is my soul mate, the way she supports me and cares for me I've never had it before, even as a kid my mum was an alcoholic and I spent my teenage years raising my 2 younger brothers and sister. My girlfriend thinks it's amazing how I ended up how I did. But like this should be a deal breaker right. I mean feel that this girl has my heart where she goes she will always have it, but if I stay with her I won't have a family.

18403,1i5ftjw,post,He used physical aggression for the second time as a form of intimidation ,"He invited me to the Poconos for his friend’s birthday celebration with a bunch of mutual friends we have at an Airbnb. Birthday boy’s new girlfriend who I like has been touching my boyfriend in ways I’m not entirely comfortable with (lying on top of him, giving him wet willy’s, going to bed and saying goodnight to everyone and only hugging my bf). I felt jealous and removed myself from the situation to process it, and I tried to tell him how it made me feel weird and when this happened he just said “Her teeth are ugly as fuck” which didn’t feel like he addressed anything, just deflected, almost as if he didn’t want to admit my suspicions were valid.  In the past he has agreed with me when I called her pretty, and throughout the trip I’ve noticed small things like looking for where she is and mentioning her often.

Anyway, after I removed myself from the process, he came back to the room when I was asleep and just shoved me with his body weight because I wasn’t giving him attention. He says I was being avoidant and causing issues because *I* was making a big deal out of nothing, also indirectly taking time away from him and his friends because he “isn’t stupid and knows I’m clearly upset”. He eventually started verbally saying a lot of things: I’m an asshole, my niceness is a facade because I’m kind to the girl but don’t actually address anything with her, I’m a snake, I’m ugly (he said this 13x, but didn’t clarify he meant my behavior until he said it 12x first), I’m a hypocrite for wanting to be a team, but running away from him and not talking about it. Frankly, either way if I addressed it during or after the trip, I don’t think he would show any understanding. 

He also grabbed the side of my stomach twice, threw a pillow at my face 3x, and grabbed my wrists forcefully when I defended myself and threw the pillow back to him. 

I’m so confused how it got to this point, this is the second time he’s been physically intimidating with me (last time was when I was 20, I’m 25 now - he pushed/pinned me down to the bed because I opened the door when he was changing and it upset him)

I feel like an idiot because I’ve broken up with him so many times but after this I know for sure he’s not my person, no matter how many good times we have. We’ve talked about how communicating when there’s conflict is an emotionally charged time and how I value respect during these times. 

This just hurts because it just felt like he kept deflecting and I might have caught on to the fact that he enjoys the attention from her. I feel that was intuitively. 

Also I feel like I’m trying to rationalize that this wasn’t abuse because he wasn’t extremely violent but I don’t think that’s true. I don’t feel like I can share this with anyone right now because who wants to hear this stuff about the guy that everyone told you isn’t good for you? I’m just sad. 

We were supposed to go to his brother’s wedding in Mexico that I already paid for. We had more plans and now I feel like he’s right that I’m avoidant in no longer wanting to continue this relationship with him because of how he handled things last night.

18405,1i5fm2h,post,i feel conflicted on what to do next w/ my career after my mom died.,"hi everyone, i'm posting this honestly bc it'll prob be cathartic to type and ofc i'm open to suggestions if applicable. i graduated w/ my BSW in 2020, MSW in 2021, got my LSW in 2022, got my CCM (certification in case management) in 2024. at like 23, i was already making $85k annually working in a hospital setting. i have had 3 jobs out of my MSW program. psych, hospital CM, and now palliative care. my last and most current job i've now been at 6 weeks as of tomorrow. i am SO BURNT OUT not necessarily from SW but from LIFE. my mom who was my bestfriend in the whole world died 6 months ago and i'm just so tired and drained of everything shitty. i have so much medical trauma and now i'm grieving the loss of the most important person in my life. i had to sell her home, move out, find a new place to live. i feel like i'm insane. i have ample support which i'm so thankful for but it doesn't make this horrible, nagging emptiness go away at its core. nothing does. nothing will. i don't know how life will get better, but i do have some semblance of hope that life won't always feel this bad, but it's just so hard to imagine. i don't have generalized anxiety (more like, anxiety triggered by traumatic experiences) and i have had so much anxiety lately after my mom's death. now, accepting this job doing pall care is weighing on me. i took the job bc it was closer to my new place and figured i could tolerate it and i do have experience working w/ this population so it seemed like a no brainer, but now that i'm here, i feel like i'm done. i can tolerate it, but i don't WANT to, honestly. so, i'm kinda thinking of doing something i never rly thought i was going to do (i'd thought of it but i didn't think i would actually end up doing it) which is go to esthetics school. i've loved skincare for as long as i can remember. however, this feels like such a huge risk. leaving, on PURPOSE, a job that's providing me w/ a stable income and soon to be providing me w/ benefits. but, if i'm already unhappy and burnt out, i can't see this getting better. at my last job, i almost quit in the beginning too but that was bc i was overwhelmed and eventually, i wasn't and i actually enjoyed the position for the most part. however, w/ this job, i already know what i'm doing/getting myself into, so i'm not confused on what the job will eventually be like, assuming i stayed and became more proficient at it, rather than still being considered new at the role. if i quit, i will need to hold myself over for a bit + pay for insurance OOP which is stressful considering i have a chronic illness, but i feel like i need to do this for my mental health. i don't want to go to esthetics school part time (would take 10 months instead of full time being 5) and work full time bc it would just be so insane in terms of scheduling that i would honestly rather not even do the school at that point at all. i was thinking of doing per diem just to feel like i'm not completely leaving the profession entirely and at least i'd get some money per month albeit not a living wage by any means lol. has anyone else found themselves in a similar situation? i've never quit a job after so little time, esp w/ the idea of kinda jumping into something completely different, too.","i feel conflicted on what to do next w/ my career after my mom died. hi everyone, i'm posting this honestly bc it'll prob be cathartic to type and ofc i'm open to suggestions if applicable. i graduated w/ my BSW in 2020, MSW in 2021, got my LSW in 2022, got my CCM (certification in case management) in 2024. at like 23, i was already making $85k annually working in a hospital setting. i have had 3 jobs out of my MSW program. psych, hospital CM, and now palliative care. my last and most current job i've now been at 6 weeks as of tomorrow. i am SO BURNT OUT not necessarily from SW but from LIFE. my mom who was my bestfriend in the whole world died 6 months ago and i'm just so tired and drained of everything shitty. i have so much medical trauma and now i'm grieving the loss of the most important person in my life. i had to sell her home, move out, find a new place to live. i feel like i'm insane. i have ample support which i'm so thankful for but it doesn't make this horrible, nagging emptiness go away at its core. nothing does. nothing will. i don't know how life will get better, but i do have some semblance of hope that life won't always feel this bad, but it's just so hard to imagine. i don't have generalized anxiety (more like, anxiety triggered by traumatic experiences) and i have had so much anxiety lately after my mom's death. now, accepting this job doing pall care is weighing on me. i took the job bc it was closer to my new place and figured i could tolerate it and i do have experience working w/ this population so it seemed like a no brainer, but now that i'm here, i feel like i'm done. i can tolerate it, but i don't WANT to, honestly. so, i'm kinda thinking of doing something i never rly thought i was going to do (i'd thought of it but i didn't think i would actually end up doing it) which is go to esthetics school. i've loved skincare for as long as i can remember. however, this feels like such a huge risk. leaving, on PURPOSE, a job that's providing me w/ a stable income and soon to be providing me w/ benefits. but, if i'm already unhappy and burnt out, i can't see this getting better. at my last job, i almost quit in the beginning too but that was bc i was overwhelmed and eventually, i wasn't and i actually enjoyed the position for the most part. however, w/ this job, i already know what i'm doing/getting myself into, so i'm not confused on what the job will eventually be like, assuming i stayed and became more proficient at it, rather than still being considered new at the role. if i quit, i will need to hold myself over for a bit + pay for insurance OOP which is stressful considering i have a chronic illness, but i feel like i need to do this for my mental health. i don't want to go to esthetics school part time (would take 10 months instead of full time being 5) and work full time bc it would just be so insane in terms of scheduling that i would honestly rather not even do the school at that point at all. i was thinking of doing per diem just to feel like i'm not completely leaving the profession entirely and at least i'd get some money per month albeit not a living wage by any means lol. has anyone else found themselves in a similar situation?

18406,1i5f5sr,post,"My Ex 23F and I 23M hooked up, Her 37M Boyfriend CRASHED OUT. Is this worth fighting for?","I definitely crossed a line.

I, 23 M reached out to my ex 23 F, for closure not expecting even a response. About a month later, she viewed the message and responded. It ended up being a conversation that lasted the whole night. and told me out of the blue how i could’ve had it all.. and confessed feelings for me. The next day, we talked over the phone and reevaluated our past relationship and agreed to stay in contact. 

As time passed, she told me things were over with her Boyfriend 35 M for various reasons including not wanting kids with her.  I was there for her and we talked more and more and more about how much we missed each other, and when she started to act more affectionate and appreciative of me. 

Eventually, they argued every day and she ended up leaving his house to stay at her friend's mom’s house. We hooked up at a hotel the next day. A couple weeks passed and we ended up at my place for our first real date. And that's when she got a call…  

Her boyfriend found out she was at my place in NYC.. He threatened to throw all her things out in the freezing cold including her CAT. And that's when she told me to come with her because she was scared of going alone.

We ended up taking an uber to her temporary place about 3 hours away to hide me there while she went to gather her boxes of things. We didn’t talk really after but only through a google document for emergencies. 

She went from saying I was IT, and she should have been with me to feeling embarrassed, ashamed, and disappointed in herself when she talks to me or thinks of me. it's confusing and hurts a lot. she misses how everything was good before but shes want to miss me. I feel like such a tool as she questions why she was with me in the first place.  it all feels so wrong knowing shes still with him physically.

They also had sex after she was intimate with me and it hurts.

She told me she stopped it and was having the worst time emotionally with it.

I think its just a toxic situation. and I think hes grooming her.

I've always been there while she chose other men.  
Is this worth fighting for?

18408,1i5etxr,post,I lost my girlfriend to a car accident and I do not have the will left to live,"I (22M) lost my girlfriend (22F) to a car accident over 2 weeks now. I do not know what to do. The way that happened was we’re going to buy groceries at a 24 hrs supermarket around 11:30 pm. Before that we had a walk in park with Noodle (our pet ferret). We were starting to feel like a little family. She was happy and laughing as I chase Noodle around the park. After that we went back to put Noodle at home and decided to go grocery shopping since we have no food left to eat. She has a scooter and I have an electric bicycle. We both are living in a foreign country and it’s hard to get license here. The supermarket was about 5 mins ride with a scooter and a 10 mins ride with my bicycle. Since I cannot ride my bicycle on the road I had to go from the sidewalk. As I get closer to the supermarket I saw people around a car and as soon as I get there my girlfriend was stuck under there. I panicked and rush to her. I held her hand and as soon as she saw me, she took 2 last breaths and she passed away. I cannot get that out of my mind and I am devastated. I do not know what to do. Im taking therapy and it doesn’t seem to ease my pain no matter how much I try. I know people would say live for her but I’m tired of life itself. I do not wish to go on anymore. This is the second time I lost someone I deeply care about. First time was my older brother who died to cancer. 

More information 

I tend to do most of the housework as I do not want her to do all of that. I cook for her, clean the house, do laundry, almost everything so that she doesn’t have to do anything. Every night I go to sleep after her as she tends to have nightmares and I would comfort her when that happens. In the morning I would wake up before her to make her breakfast. I don’t do these things only on days that I am too tired to get up. Before that a week ago, she hugged me out of nowhere after I done the laundry. I asked her what’s wrong and she look up to me with a smile and said, “ You know, you make me want to live more, you make me want to enjoy life and you make me want to have a future with you together.” That day I was the happiest man ever. Sad that I dun get to see that happen.

She had struggled with mental illness and for the longest time I have been her biggest supporter and being there for her even before we started dating. I would always comfort her. After we started dating whenever she had a breakdown, i would always carry her back to bed hold her tight in my arms and just comfort her. I would always say “It’s ok, you can fall apart, I would hold you together. Even if you broke down to pieces, I would pick everything up and build you back again.” She did the same for me too when life gets me overwhelmed and I couldn’t do anything. It was a beautiful love.

18409,1i5epiz,post,I don't know what to do.,"Life has been so draining. I got homeschooled back in June 2024 due to bullying issues, it wasn't the first time I was bullied either. The first time was because I was close friends with a girl and she was joking about sh and I was worried for her, I checked to see if she did it or not and that caused issues making my whole year hate me, I was 12 at the time. That made me not go to school since it was hell for me. I had shoes thrown at my head, tipex put on my face, people talking shit when I was right by them ect. It got to the next year in school (Year 9) after having 35% of my Year 8 time off school. But that was when things got worse since I just didn't show up to school much, the only better thing about that year was the bullying had stopped, I just became too depressed to go back into school after spending my days in bed. Anyways, I used to date this girl in Year 8 (when the bullying didn't happen yet) until she randomly moved back to her home country. She arrived back at my school and we hit it off, everything was going good and it made me try to come in to school more for her, I eventually told a few people I'm going to ask her out and had got her gifts: one of those long letters you have to pull, paper roses which I made, and got her a cake. But that was when someone told people I was apparently a stalker to her, that I knew where she lived, that I got her favourite book and made love hearts with my blood or something. I didn't know that they said that though. My best friend at the time messaged me saying how I'm obsessive, creepy and a weirdo and she didn't like me anymore which made me confused. Plus, my crush told me that she liked people who were possessive and how she gets easily jealous which didn't help. This all happened a week before my birthday. I quit school after that because I didn't want to go through part 2 of bullying. Oh, and I was only told a few months later by her about what people had said.

Fast forward to me now, Jan 2025. I'm so alone. No one from my school has even messaged me nor asked how I'm doing. I tried talking to my old friends and saying ""We should hang out!"" but apparently not. I'm so tired of everything, the only things keeping me here is my my streaming (I stream on twitch) and my baby niece since I dont want her to grow up and look back on photos to ask my sister ""Who is that?"".

This world is so full of evil, especially as a 14yr old girl. Men are evil, our world is fucked, inflation is a thing, global warming is a thing.. Whats the point in living if everything gets miserable past 18. These years are meant to be the best times of my life but I'm sitting here at 2am writing on reddit how I want to die.

18412,1i5ebwj,post,"I’m turning 30 and feel lost, defeated, and hopeless","TL;DR:
I’m almost 30, married, and working full-time in tech in Berlin, Germany. Despite saving aggressively (€40k/year), I feel like my dream of owning a home, having a family, and living a modest lifestyle is unattainable. Burnout, job stagnation, and the state of the world are crushing me, and I don’t know how to move forward.
--

Not sure if anyone here feels the same, but I feel like I’m losing the game of life and can’t get back on track. For the past decade, I’ve had a simple dream:

A modest 3–4 room apartment with a big kitchen.
A family with two kids.
A 5-year-old hybrid car and an electric bike.

But this ""basic"" lifestyle feels unattainable, like it’s reserved for millionaires or business owners. At least here in Germany. I've always imagined I will have it by 30, but no.

My Situation

I’m married, and both my wife and I work full-time in tech in Berlin, Germany. I’m a senior software engineer, but there’s no growth left in my role unless I move into management — which I hate. My salary maxes out at around €4,500/month after tax. My wife is in a dead-end job with no promotion prospects, and the job market here is brutal, so switching careers feels impossible for both of us. Her income is just under 3000/month after tax.

We’ve optimized savings to the point of living like hermits—saving €40,000 in 2024 (up from €30,000 in 2023)—but it’s still not enough for a 20% down payment on a home. And cutting back on life experiences for financial goals is taking a toll on our happiness and relationship.

We've also decided not to have kids until we get our place, as we don't want to and won't be able to work as hard as we do now.

The Bigger Picture

There’s a general sense of doom and gloom. The cost of living keeps rising, society feels more toxic, and AI threatens job stability. War is close to Europe, and nothing feels as safe or comfortable as it did even a few years ago. All of this makes me afraid to take risks, so I just keep grinding. But grinding isn’t working either.

I feel stuck. My dream feels further away every year, and I’m running on empty—mentally and emotionally. It feels like my life isn’t even mine anymore, just a bad movie I’m forced to watch.

What Now?

The only logical option seems to be to keep enduring. But I’ve been doing that for years, and it’s killing me inside. I don't want to be a villain from that article. A family man who used all savings to buy a Toyota Supra. But emotionally I feel like I'm either doing that, or putting myself out, as my dreams are not coming to reality ","I’m turning 30 and feel lost, defeated, and hopeless TL;DR:

Burnout, job stagnation, and the state of the world are crushing me, and I don’t know how to move forward.
--

Not sure if anyone here feels the same, but I feel like I’m losing the game of life and can’t get back on track. For the past decade, I’ve had a simple dream:

A modest 3–4 room apartment with a big kitchen.
A family with two kids.
A 5-year-old hybrid car and an electric bike.

But this ""basic"" lifestyle feels unattainable, like it’s reserved for millionaires or business owners. At least here in Germany. I've always imagined I will have it by 30, but no.

My Situation

I’m married, and both my wife and I work full-time in tech in Berlin, Germany. I’m a senior software engineer, but there’s no growth left in my role unless I move into management — which I hate. My salary maxes out at around €4,500/month after tax. My wife is in a dead-end job with no promotion prospects, and the job market here is brutal, so switching careers feels impossible for both of us. Her income is just under 3000/month after tax.

We’ve optimized savings to the point of living like hermits—saving €40,000 in 2024 (up from €30,000 in 2023)—but it’s still not enough for a 20% down payment on a home. And cutting back on life experiences for financial goals is taking a toll on our happiness and relationship.

We've also decided not to have kids until we get our place, as we don't want to and won't be able to work as hard as we do now.

The Bigger Picture

There’s a general sense of doom and gloom. The cost of living keeps rising, society feels more toxic, and AI threatens job stability. War is close to Europe, and nothing feels as safe or comfortable as it did even a few years ago. All of this makes me afraid to take risks, so I just keep grinding. But grinding isn’t working either.

I feel stuck. My dream feels further away every year, and I’m running on empty—mentally and emotionally. It feels like my life isn’t even mine anymore, just a bad movie I’m forced to watch.

What Now?

The only logical option seems to be to keep enduring. But I’ve been doing that for years, and it’s killing me inside. I don't want to be a villain from that article. A family man who used all savings to buy a Toyota Supra. But emotionally I feel like I'm either doing that, or putting myself out, as my dreams are not coming to reality ",1,2,2025-01-20 1:04,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1i5ebwj/im_turning_30_and_feel_lost_defeated_and_hopeless/,Neutral

Except for eventually all of those things erode away early developed friendships and the group breaks off into smaller groups 


I’m sorry if this writing seems all over the place or lacking of any real structure but this situation in its current form is eating at me like a parasite every night and I’m trying to tell this story the best I can. 


For the sake of my own paranoia I’ll refer to this Friend as just BF (best friend) for the whole post) to try and keep some semblance of anonymity. 

Post HS we were the only two that college wasn’t really an option for, their career in college was short lived due to finances and mine never took off due to grades. So we bother entered the workforce pretty much immediately. Over those years I’d always grow frustrated with them because it seems like they’d land a decent job and work there for a few months but ultimately they’d leave it and it was never their fault and this has been the case for over a 13 or so years now. As a matter of fact nothing is ever his fault not even their current situation. It’s the fault of these “evil companies” and “greedy capitalists” which like yeah true for sure but also everyone has that same problem and yet we’ve all made it out on our mutual friend came from literally nothing as a kid unstable housing, physical abuse, guardians that abused drugs and he makes 150K a year now and has a healthy blooming relationship. So it’s fucking possible man. 

It’s just been a continuous cycle of BF losing work, losing housing, needing us to come to the rescue but then over the years when I’ve brought up options for them to find steady work in various fields that entry level jobs that pay fairly decent for hard work and it’s just been met with “that’s hard and dangerous and I don’t want to do it” but somehow they’ve always had these ideals and dreams of wealth and opulence. Being a big time streamer, a successful business owner, making millions day trading but again those are far fetched while still possible but it’s not putting food in your stomach TODAY and I have never been able to have a serious conversation with them about just that because it immediately turns hostile but it’s only coming from a place of love. 

Let me back up a bit about Bf this is all over the place and I’m sorry. 

We’ve been great friends for almost 20 years now 
Hell siblings even. We’ve had similar upbringings and similar success and failures in our younger lives but I’ve always made it work by any means necessary if the going gets tough then so be it I’ll make it through. We’ve had each others backs when we can but it’s often been myself or other friends rescuing them and not the other way around. We share great laughs and deeply great conversations that only truly deeply bonded friends can but that only makes up for so much you know? 

The most recent situation that can encapsulate over a decade of this behavior has been that BF decided to move cities and states sortve on a whim with no real plan whatsoever. They slept in their car and just sortve hoped it would work out. It didn’t and instead of telling us what was going on it just kinda sprung on us when we went to visit “uh hey guys I’m kind of between housing situations at the moment” they managed to lose one car due a mechanical fault that was caused by someone else. Bought another one, when it crashed it was repossessed by the city for lack of insurance and the only way I managed to find that out was it eventually trickled out that that friend only carried a roadside assistance club membership and not insurance and then had the gall to be mad about the cops towing their car and impounding it! 

These last few weeks after being let go from a job they’ve been doing gig economy jobs in a rental car. A losing transaction no matter who you ask or what the location is. When I asked why they didn’t just get a normal job like retail or something it was met with hostility as if that was beneath him but all the while the money he had was steadily dwindling away but none of this was ever their fault! Keep in mind how often I have to hear that! 

Now we reach the last week’s situation that has just gnawed at me like a sickness.  They want to come stay with me which in and of itself is a cumbersome task because I have a roommate that has a fair say in what goes on in our house and it’s a hard sell to just bring a total stranger down with no money to crash on our couch but damnit I’ll do it. The rental cars gone back. They have no place to go and I have no way to get them down to me. I’m tapped after I pay my bills. And everyday I have to look at myself in the mirror knowing BF is on the streets in lethal freezing weather with no help and I’m unable to provide it and I get texts like “hope I don’t fucking die and if I do don’t come looking for me” what the fuck am I supposed to say to that?! What am I even supposed to fucking do man?! You’ve burned everyone else in our friend group and I can’t do a fucking thing so now I’m being constantly reminded that they’re in a potentially life threading situation and the most I can offer is “I’m sorry”. 


It just makes me so fucking mad you did this to yourself. You led yourself to ruin. How have you been so dense all this time to not see how you’ve impeded on others. How you’ve made your life worse trying to circumvent and shorten the path we all have to take? How is this my fucking responsibility!??!? 

Anyway that’s all I can muster I don’t know that I feel any better but at least I’ve told someone.

18418,1i5dwf9,post,graduation could not come any sooner ,"hello all. i really need to get things off my chest, as per the sub. it’s hard for me to talk to my friends about this, because i constantly feel like a leech towards them. some context — 

i’m a senior in high school who graduates in may. all of my life, i have been told that once i graduate, all ties are loose. i will have no support, except the emotional kind and asking questions when needed. i have never had a job, because i am not allowed to. i have never had a car, nor gotten my license, because i have not been allowed to, and i have not been allowed to make money. i’ve only been granted the freedoms of going out ever since my father and i moved, which was in april of 2024. partially my fault, partially the situation i was in. however, recently, another issue has cropped up: my health. i won’t disclose my condition (for fear this could get back to people i know), but it stems from another illness (according to the doctors) and leaves me with debilitating nausea, a light case of asthma, legs that are getting less functional by the day, and memory and attention that is probably on par with a goldfish. obviously, i’m exaggerating some, but my condition is not far off. i’ve been seeing doctors occasionally, but they haven’t given me many answers. unfortunately my next appointment isn’t for several months and my legs and general condition aren’t improving, even with the medication i’m given. all of this, in turn, affects my school work. my last semester was horrible, with two of my grades being low Ds. i’ve generally been a B or above student all my life, so this hasn’t gone over too well with my father. 

this brings up the next part, where all this context is needed — i’m going to college. however, my dad, who is my only familial connection here, is moving states away, so far that a connector flight is needed. this isn’t great, because i’ll still be a minor when he moves. and on top of that, i’m being forced to move all of my things to a new state for two months or so, until my move-in day in august. 

but that’s not the worst part. the worst part is that i have no support. there is no college fund, there is no “dad paying loans”. it’s all me. he doesn’t even want to fill out my fafsa paper work, because he doesn’t trust the government. so basically, i’m going completely solo. the only person really helping me is my best friend, and i couldn’t be more grateful. she’s a freshman at the college i’m going to, and we’re planning on dorming together if possible. this happiness is always overshadowed by my dad though. he constantly tells me i’m not living in reality by going to college (he never went either) and claims i’m running away by going to college. 

and sure, that might be partially true. i’m running away from the strict rules and never making money and never existing on my own. but i still love my dad. but today brought the worst of the worst to light and it made me really question everything. 

my dad isn’t going to file my health care after i turn eighteen and leave for college. he’s no longer filing me on his taxes, either. i’m basically completely on my own, and if my health doesn’t improve by then, then i feel like i’ll really be screwed. this really hurt to find out, and i’m not too sure why. but i wish he could see that this blatant disregard for my health could really be detrimental to our relationship. 

also, this isn’t the first time he’s done something similar. my older sister didn’t have a plan, and he made her go into the military. he doesn’t support either of us in any physical way, which kind of sucks. 

i mostly came to rant here, but any advice is really appreciated. i could be looking at this like a kid, but it still really sucks. i just wish this nightmare was over. sorry if this doesn’t make sense, it’s pretty late here and i’m tired. thank you.

this brings up the next part, where all this context is needed — i’m going to college. however, my dad, who is my only familial connection here, is moving states away, so far that a connector flight is needed. this isn’t great, because i’ll still be a minor when he moves. and on top of that, i’m being forced to move all of my things to a new state for two months or so, until my move-in day in august. 

but that’s not the worst part. the worst part is that i have no support. there is no college fund, there is no “dad paying loans”. it’s all me. he doesn’t even want to fill out my fafsa paper work, because he doesn’t trust the government. so basically, i’m going completely solo. the only person really helping me is my best friend, and i couldn’t be more grateful. she’s a freshman at the college i’m going to, and we’re planning on dorming together if possible. this happiness is always overshadowed by my dad though. he constantly tells me i’m not living in reality by going to college (he never went either) and claims i’m running away by going to college. 

and sure, that might be partially true. i’m running away from the strict rules and never making money and never existing on my own. but i still love my dad. but today brought the worst of the worst to light and it made me really question everything. 

my dad isn’t going to file my health care after i turn eighteen and leave for college. he’s no longer filing me on his taxes, either. i’m basically completely on my own, and if my health doesn’t improve by then, then i feel like i’ll really be screwed. this really hurt to find out, and i’m not too sure why. but i wish he could see that this blatant disregard for my health could really be detrimental to our relationship. 

also, this isn’t the first time he’s done something similar. my older sister didn’t have a plan, and he made her go into the military. he doesn’t support either of us in any physical way, which kind of sucks. 

i mostly came to rant here, but any advice is really appreciated. i could be looking at this like a kid, but it still really sucks. i just wish this nightmare was over. sorry if this doesn’t make sense, it’s pretty late here and i’m tired. thank you.

18419,1i5dw0i,post,One month but a lifetime ago,"My sweet baby angel it's been a month since you left us. 
31 days since we knew you were no longer with us. 
744 hours without you, yes I'm counting it down,
44640 minutes of trying to find a reason,
To not just give up, to keep going, and growing. 

I remember that morning like it just happened.
31 days straight I wake up and think about that moment. 
The moment I knew you were no longer with us. 
Crying in the bathroom alone, scared and confused. 
Telling your dad something wasn't right and we needed to go to the ER.
We were both in immediate pain and anguish, fear palpable as we drew near. 

I knew before arriving you left us that morning, 
And my sweet baby angel, you left us in mourning.
Mimi and Pop Pop held us so right and  close,
The sad truth was that the distance between was your ghost. 
Our sweet miracle baby, this is driving us crazy. 
You came as a gift sent straight from above,
You were already covered in so much love.
For 31 days, you're all I can think of, 
Our baby sent us unconditional love. 

Your Dad and I are so broken, 
With your loss our hearts you had awoken. 
We sleep during the day and play games all night long,
Missing you so much since you've been gone.
It's just a distraction from the truth,
You left us for heaven on 12.14.2024.
I miss you, I miss us, I miss the light behind your dad's eyes.
How i wish we at least got to see your sweet eyes.

Disassociation is hard to ignore, 
Why is the pain worse than before.
Some days are better and some are worse, 
I know it doesn't make sense but I feel like I'm cursed.
Cursed to live a life without children and longevity,
Cursed to keep going when my baby had such a short brevity.
Cursed to love but never hold you, or see you grow,
We went from playing a multiplayer to playing Solo. 

The days keep moving but we're standing still,
Some days I wake up feeling so ill.
The heartbreak is worse than morning sickness was, 
I complained and complained, this was one of my flaws,
How i wish I could take back all of the complaining,
Since you've been gone it seems every day it's raining.

It brings me great comfort to remember this,
The family we've already lost, got a new gift.
They get to hold you and keep you safe,
Until dad and I can join you some day.
We arent in a rush we know you're in good hands,
Our family just needed a piece of us,
It wasn't our time, 
I hate that you had to leave us behind. 
I understand now with time and patience,
We can't rush the process, or try to rush or hasten 

To our grandmas, grandpa's, aunt and uncles, please take care of our angel. 

Time is a cruel and unusual beast.

To all the moms and dads living with this grief, of never meeting our babies and stuck in the quicksand. Here, reach up, I'm giving you my hand. I'll help pull you up if you help me too. Be kind to each other, hold your partner close, remind them it's still just ""us two"". When the time is right we will be blessed, in one way or another. I wish you all had the family you dream of, continue to heal and help each other up. We're stronger than we think l, it isn't bad luck. It's a decision we make every day that we wake, to keep going and going, even with this sad fate. Don't the quicksand take you until you can't break just take all the time you need to grieve. We all grieve different, we all take different amounts of time, give yourself grace and things will be fine. Lean on your partner, your parents and friends, if anything as a reminder not all good things come to an end. This isn't goodbye it's more of a see you later, don't let what happened turn us into a hater. A hater of love, life and happiness, dads please cry too it doesn't change your manliness. My fellow moms, I know it's happened in our bodies and we carry such guilt but please remember your partner is going thru it too. They may not have the hormones affecting day to day life like us, but they too had dreams that were squandered away. Hold each other a little longer, take a deep breathe, grab my hand if you need it, together we can get stronger. Choose yourself, choose your partner, and choose life again, stewing in the pain isn't letting anyone in. Our stories are all original, but we are not alone. Together we are stronger, try not to feel the pain any longer. Smile when you can because life is too short, and if you need a hand or two I'll be here with support.

18423,1i5dnvr,post,I'm struggling to forgive my girlfriend.,"Ok, so I'm having what I'm sure are just some growing pains. My fiance and I live in a small space. We both have ADHD and autism. We both have a couple side hobbies/hustles for fun and to make some extra money. My fiance is really into reselling stuff online and does quite well with it. It may not bring in a ton of money, but it keeps clothing out of the landfills and that's the important thing.

My main hobby is model building. Primarily Warhammer 40k. It has really helped me with my muscle control issues and has helped build up my confidence a lot by getting me out into groups to socialize. I really like the artistic side of it too, and it has been a lot of effort to get better thanks to my muscle problems. But, I have! And I'm really proud of myself for it as I've put hundreds and hundreds of work hours into these models. And it actually showed*

Now here's where the actual issues start

I will occasionally flip card game stuff if I see a good deal pick it up, and go through the big task of pulling out my entire collection from storage, sorting everything and valuing everything, getting it all up for sale. I can burn out on this really quickly. So, at this time my cards were on my desk, and my models I had been painting/taking pictures of were over in a corner on the floor out of the way. Well, I got hit with some big stuff within the past couple of months and have been suffering from chronic burnout. Everything is overwhelming and even doing something like brushing my teeth can cause me to melt down if anything* goes wrong. Well, this causes me to sit in place. This was a pretty bad one and things stayed in place for like three months and didn't move an inch.

My fiance during this time was picking up a ton of clothes and fill in the floor space with stuff to resell. This became a lot as we didn't have much room to move. And my models started to get broken. I moved them to the next available spot and well, that spot ended up being needed. It was to the point where we were both just kind of buried in clothes. So, one day she decides that she's gonna clean the room because she knew it was one of the things keeping me in my mental slump and I wasn't able to provide help at the time. Something I very much appreciated and still do! The issue is, she didn't stop at the clothes.  She picked up every model around the room that wasn't specifically on the display shelf an just started throwing them into boxes. I panicked at the time and told her please don't do that the ones that are in that box are stood up in a very specific way because they are very fragile and made of resin and because I don't have a printer anymore I can't remake these they make up like 60% of that army please don't treat them like that. She said okay and continued doing that anyways though because I had turned over and basically tried to ignore the situation because I didn't want to have a meltdown I just kind of let her keep going. Well fast forward to today my friend asked me if I wanted to play the game with him and for the first time in months I'm actually feeling up enough to go and socialize. In my mind I know right where my models are for my army and the condition they're in. I pull out a box and notice that several of my models had been broken. Resin ones that I had made myself, as well as the official plastic ones which are really expensive and had been painted. I panicked and asked her why everything was like this and she said she treated them how I treat them. And that she didn't think it would be a big deal I told her that in fact no it was a very big deal to me because not only are these models really expensive to get in the first place they took a lot of time to get to the level that I got them to and a lot of my mental health journey has been equated to the models. Something that she is aware of. I told her that a simple I am sorry wasn't really fixing the issue because there was no way to fix anything. The plastic models that were busted were missing critical pieces for tournament play and the resin models have been annihilated to the point where they're unusable. I had a 40k collection worth about 3.5-4k in raw value before all the extras. Paint, time, magnetization, specific wargear parts, ect. I don't want to even think about how much the actual value of lost models and parts is. But out of three separate armies (literally hundreds of models), I have two bigger kits that are fine and maybe 3 squads of infantry. Dozens that may* still be allowed to play at tournament level, but I've lost 2/3rds of everything I have because it was grabbed, thrown into a random box, that then thrown into a pile.

I'm so so so mad at her but I really don't want to be. She was just trying to help, but I think she tried to the point where she overwhelmed herself and started to just kinda...go. I know she didn't mean anything by it, but to tell me it was basically my fault for not picking them up after knowing the severity of the issue and offering to help me...kinda hurts. It's like ""yeah, of course it is, that's why you felt like you needed to help me because I couldn't help myself at the time. She then started to get mad saying that it's how I treated them so why should I be upset? 

Well, I explained how much they meant to me, and what they represented to me, and how I was really disappointed and sad that so much time and effort had been wrecked because we couldn't make out space work with each other. She then started apologizing and said she'd replace it all. I told her she literally couldn't afford to replace it all. Because I'd have to count hours of building and painting in with it. She asked how much, I ballparked it at around 2.5-3k. Her face dropped and she stomped off saying I should have just done it and that I need to stop punishing her and being upset.

I apologized for being upset and tried to explain that I was struggling to forgive her in the moment because of how important these things were to me. And that even if she replaced everything I had hundreds and hundreds of hours of work ahead of me to get it back to the level I had them. Which was basically going to be impossible for me moving forward. I explained I was basically at a crossroads of just dump this stuff and call it a loss or try to gather up the mental energy to move forward. And that I was upset that on top of all that: my first day being healthy enough to see my friend was ruined for me because of all this.

I just feel beaten down by all this. I want to forgive her so so so badly but I just can't let it go. They're were so much more to me than little model kits. They had sentimental value that can't just be bought again.

I want to forgive her, I don't want to be this upset, I don't want to fight or anything I just want to not be upset anymore.

But I just...

Can't.

Years ago I tried to transition but ultimately failed, partly because I couldn't get myself to fully commit to it, partly because I never really found a style I felt comfortable in, and partly because I convinced myself that my lack of commitment was because I wasn't really trans and was just being manipulated. But now the dysphoria has re-emerged and I feel stuck. I feel like any attempt I make will result in an awkward and unconvincing failure that'll make me feel worse, but I can't live like this forever. I want to make my desire to be feminine visible, and I fantasise about getting attention from people by passing really well even though I don't know what it'll look like. It's just hard making that first step and then continuing. I still feel weird about being ""manipulated"" into it, but I don't know how to make myself do it on my own, so maybe I don't have a choice. I wish I had some kind of accountability buddy for it, but one that I could somehow fully trust to not have ulterior motives. Idk, I just feel like I need a push.","I feel like I need a push to start exploring feminine gender presentation. I've known that I experience gender dysphoria for a long time now.

18425,1i5dj4f,post,My post got removed from relationship advice so now I’m here,"I (27F) and my partner (28M) have been together for seven years. We have lived together for a few years now, but for the past year I have been feeling like I might be falling out of love.

He goes to his home town almost every single weekend to hang out with the same group of friends he's had since high school and it just feels like he'll never grow up. He gets drunk and stays up all night (until 4-5) and I am just so over it.
l used to go with him a couple years ago but have stopped because I don't want to be spending so many of my weekends at the same bars or hanging out in someone's garage. I've tried driving separately and the moment he starts drinking I know he won't stop and will be up all night. So I would just leave because I don't want to be around that. When he gets drunk, he completely ignores me and sometimes it goes as far as him yelling at me saying I ruin all his fun, I always want to leave, I make everything about me, etc. Oh and he's also lied to me multiple times about doing drugs when he's hammered.

When I've talked to him about how this bothers me, he says that how late he stays up and if he's drinking shouldn't matter to me or not if I'm not there.

With each time he has left and I have stayed at home, l grow to enjoy my solitude. I feel like I want to leave and live on my own but financially I'm just not ready.

TL;DR: I've been together with my partner for 7 years and we live together. He gets drunk with his high school buddies nearly every weekend, stays up until 4am. l've communicated this to him before but obviously nothing has changed. I want to move out but can't due to financials. Just wanted to vent.","My post got removed from relationship advice so now I’m here I (27F) and my partner (28M) have been together for seven years.

18429,1i5d2yl,post,Your version of talking to me... I hate it.,"My wife, drives me absolutely insane.

I know there are going to be alot of people that hate on me for this, and you know, what, I don't give a fuck.

Because when I'm gaming, I want to be left in my little bubble. I enjoy detatching from all the stresses of life, from my meager life as a fast food employee, and taking time for myself to not deal with things.

And she will come up, and just talk... and talk... and talk... not even talking with me, but talking at me, and for the life of me, she will never, ever just let me game. 

IT's not the fact that we don't spend time together, we spend PLENTY of time, working at the same place. We spend hours together on days and weekdays, nights... we have fun.

But when I'm trying to focus, I'm trying to be where I am and not be her husband, she just cannot, will not, leave me be.

And that's not to say it's just she wants to be there for 'company'.

No, she's giving me crucial details, information, and things she's expecting me to remember. I've told her, many, many times do not talk to me while I'm gaming, I don't hear you, I don't remember what you said, I'm not paying attention. Yet time and time again, she refuses to understand the basic concept of I'M NOT LISTENING TO YOU AND YOU'RE JUST DISTRACTING ME!!!!

I love her to death, she's been my wife for 8 years, but for the love of all that is holy and good, just let me fucking play my COD for a few hours and stop trying to make important decisions while I'm not present in that moment. I have my headphones on, I am locked in, IM NOT HEARING YOU.

And no, I can't just 'pause it'. Where the hell does everyone think that I can just pause a live, competitive shooter game??? No, I can't just put the controler down and lsiten to you... nope, I'm dead. Thanks, you fucking got me killed... No, because you're breaking my concentration, I'm trying to focus... No, you're not a bad wife, you just need to wait, until I'm ndone... No, you just... you can't yank my arm away from the controller and snuggle down with me and force yourself into my lap. 

  
It's every, single... time. I'm trying to focus, I'm in my world, and then she pulls on my headphones to 'get my attention' or sometimes just sits infront of the TV until I break my focus and focus on her.

  
I've lost entire matches, and it throws me complete off my game. I've spent hours trying to recover sometimes what I lose in games like Rust and Tarkov.

  
And no matter how many times I ask to just... in those hours let me be, it never happens. She gets all pouty that I won't come take a walk with her, when she asked 30 minutes ago, while I was not paying attention to her. She'll throw tantrums because 'I don't ever talk to her' when I just spent 5 hours talking with her about the latest book she's read from the romance novels she has (she reads alot of Sarah J Maas.)

But no, my time is her time, and her time is her time.

It makes me so angry... I like being competivie and I can't focus if I'm constantly being attacked.","Your version of talking to me... I hate it. My wife, drives me absolutely insane.

18431,1i4uv7u,post,I have the same birthday as his ex,"I know it's stupid to be upset about this, but I still get sad about it as we get closer to my birthday.

I (27F) share the same birthdate as my bf's (31M) ex. He split from her last spring but they had been together for a few years. He admitted to me that they still talk sometimes, he swears it's all just cordial, bumping into each other around town (we live in a small town so it is going to happen) and normal friendly greetings, the occasional text message to catch up. If she sees his (very recognizable) car, she will send him a message and see what he's up to.

I didn't like hearing that they still talk but I can't well force him to go no contact with her. He sends screenshots of their chats whenever they ask, so I don't think he is hiding anything, but I hate thinking that he has her on his mind still. We have been seeing each other now 7 months and things overall are going well, we have our ups and downs but at the end of the day we still love each other.

He admits that they still are friends and that they still have feelings for each other because they were together for so long, but assures me that nothing will happen between them. that things between them will never work out.

What is bothering me is the knowledge that on my birthday his first thought is instead going to be about her. That he will tell her happy birthday first. That he will forget my birthday and tell me about hers and how she reached out about it or something.

I know it is stupid and childish but my whole life I have never gotten to have a birthday that was actually about me. I always split it with other family, had to work the entire day, had my friends and even my parents forget and tell me happy birthday on the wrong day. The one time I tried to do something to celebrate, one of my friends bailed because he ""didn't feel like going"" and another invited someone who had previously sexually assaulted me AND SHE KNEW HE DID IT, so I was super uncomfortable and upset.

Since that, I haven't even tried to do anything to celebrate, but I was hoping that for a change with this one person I love and who says he loves me, maybe we could do something small to celebrate. Get food, play a game, watch something, literally anything little that would be a bit out of the ordinary.

For his birthday we got food and played games that he likes together all night and it was great, I also got him something he had been really wanting.

He asked me what my birthday is and when I told him his first response is about how it's the same as hers.

That's just the one day that I want his mind to only be on me.

He's the only one I want to actually care at least a little bit about it anymore.

I decided that rather than let myself be hurt again on my birthday I am instead going to remove it from my socials, set it to a random date for any that I can't remove, not mention it. I know he won't be able to find out from anyone else since nobody else remembers it.

Anyway, I just wanted to get this out of my brain and put it into writing. I get really sad any time I think about it, but I expect after the date passes I will be okay again, that it will be just another day again.","I have the same birthday as his ex I know it's stupid to be upset about this, but I still get sad about it as we get closer to my birthday.

18432,1i3dxcj,post,Last year I was almost human trafficked.... ,"TW: CSA, SA, human trafficking, stalking, drug abuse, psychosis 

**Hi everyone,**

I’m here to share my story and seek support from others who’ve survived similar experiences. My biggest problem in life, lately, has been disrupted sleep, trust issues and high baseline anxiety after my recent big traumas. Oh, not to mention the depressive symptoms.  I’m doing my best to stay strong, but the aftermath of trauma is so heavy, and I could really use some advice or encouragement.

My history of sexual trauma began early, with childhood abuse at daycare and an assault in high school. Those experiences left me feeling fractured and struggling to understand who is safe or trustworthy. It also made me turn against my own body. Like, in the form of fasting and other self injury. And so I started to self medicate with weed when I was eighteen and I guess some social drinking sometimes too. 

In 2023, things spiraled. Like, ***really fucking spiraled.*** And I am only just now realizing how bad things had gotten for me and I am asking how I can heal? I was assaulted twice by two different men. One incident involved a predator posing as a videographer; the other, a married man who violated my consent in ways that left me reeling. He told me I just seemed like that type of girl when I asked him why he stealthed me. And, now that’s part of my self image. I want to get over it. On top of that, I had a ""friend"" I trusted, who exploited my vulnerability by lacing weed he was giving me, driving me into heavy daily usage, and ultimately setting me up to be blacked out on substances around the rapists I had outed on my social media. The dangerous... wealthy.... organized crime affiliated rapists whom I had crossed !!!!!! I crossed them because I outed them online. 

Things escalated when I noticed these individuals stalking me while I was with the weed selling man I considered a friend, who had been giving me his weed and encouraging me to abuse it heavily, and daily, for months. I’m almost certain they intended to traffic me. Which is a bit odd because I am not even an easy target. I am college educated, I don’t have a criminal record and my only mental health diagnoses are CPTSD and ADHD so it’s not like it’s normal for me to take risks or act unstable. I am young and I make mistakes like everyone else, but it’s just not. My family was as shocked as me. But I had to tell them everything when I was fucked up on my weed seller's weed and hanging out with him at a restaurant.... until my other married rapists tried really hard to get me alone again.... BY POSING AS A FUCKING WAITER??? LIKE HELLO !!!!! THAT IS SOME CARTOON VILLIANY. Thankfully, I was able to act quickly and alert the public during a critical moment at a public place, avoiding what could have been a catastrophic situation. Because when my weed seller gave me a ride to do some errands… my other rapist, the married one, showed up trying to get me alone again. And now I am forever haunted by what would have happened if I went with my rapist and was alone with him again. Nothing good, in fact I am suspecting a gang rape might have been attempted or worse. 

Since then, I’ve gone no-contact with everyone involved, entered inpatient care, and completed two PTSD-focused group therapy programs. I showed my family my rapist's photos and pictures and addresses, the ones I know about at least, so they can help me avoid these scary people. I’ve started to rebuild my life—I’ve made new, healthy friendships, pursued creative outlets again, and worked on restoring my physical health. But I’m still on edge. My hyper vigilance and fractured trust make it hard to feel safe anywhere or with anyone. I just have paranoid fears that anyone could be affiliated with my rapists because I have never encountered organized crime before??? I come from a expensive suburb, I have professional and strict parents and I myself am very straight laced so like this made me lose my mind. I have never seen the world of crime before and I never want to again. It is like my dad said... the whole thing was very unlike me but I was clearly being manipulated by these older people. And also, clearly self medicating to cope with my previous traumas. 

To those who’ve been through anything similar: How do you cope with the constant feeling of being unsafe, even after cutting off contact and seeking help? How do you rebuild your sense of security and normalcy?

Thank you for reading. I know my story is heavy, but I hope sharing it here can help me connect with others who truly understand. ","Last year I was almost human trafficked....  TW: CSA, SA, human trafficking, stalking, drug abuse, psychosis 

**Hi everyone,**

I’m here to share my story and seek support from others who’ve survived similar experiences. My biggest problem in life, lately, has been disrupted sleep, trust issues and high baseline anxiety after my recent big traumas. Oh, not to mention the depressive symptoms.  I’m doing my best to stay strong, but the aftermath of trauma is so heavy, and I could really use some advice or encouragement.

My history of sexual trauma began early, with childhood abuse at daycare and an assault in high school. Those experiences left me feeling fractured and struggling to understand who is safe or trustworthy. It also made me turn against my own body. Like, in the form of fasting and other self injury. And so I started to self medicate with weed when I was eighteen and I guess some social drinking sometimes too. 

In 2023, things spiraled. Like, ***really fucking spiraled.*** And I am only just now realizing how bad things had gotten for me and I am asking how I can heal? I was assaulted twice by two different men. One incident involved a predator posing as a videographer; the other, a married man who violated my consent in ways that left me reeling. He told me I just seemed like that type of girl when I asked him why he stealthed me. And, now that’s part of my self image. I want to get over it. On top of that, I had a ""friend"" I trusted, who exploited my vulnerability by lacing weed he was giving me, driving me into heavy daily usage, and ultimately setting me up to be blacked out on substances around the rapists I had outed on my social media. The dangerous... wealthy.... organized crime affiliated rapists whom I had crossed !!!!!! I crossed them because I outed them online. 

Things escalated when I noticed these individuals stalking me while I was with the weed selling man I considered a friend, who had been giving me his weed and encouraging me to abuse it heavily, and daily, for months. I’m almost certain they intended to traffic me. Which is a bit odd because I am not even an easy target. I am college educated, I don’t have a criminal record and my only mental health diagnoses are CPTSD and ADHD so it’s not like it’s normal for me to take risks or act unstable. I am young and I make mistakes like everyone else, but it’s just not. My family was as shocked as me. But I had to tell them everything when I was fucked up on my weed seller's weed and hanging out with him at a restaurant.... until my other married rapists tried really hard to get me alone again.... BY POSING AS A FUCKING WAITER??? LIKE HELLO !!!!! THAT IS SOME CARTOON VILLIANY. Thankfully, I was able to act quickly and alert the public during a critical moment at a public place, avoiding what could have been a catastrophic situation. Because when my weed seller gave me a ride to do some errands… my other rapist, the married one, showed up trying to get me alone again. And now I am forever haunted by what would have happened if I went with my rapist and was alone with him again. Nothing good, in fact I am suspecting a gang rape might have been attempted or worse. 

Since then, I’ve gone no-contact with everyone involved, entered inpatient care, and completed two PTSD-focused group therapy programs. I showed my family my rapist's photos and pictures and addresses, the ones I know about at least, so they can help me avoid these scary people. I’ve started to rebuild my life—I’ve made new, healthy friendships, pursued creative outlets again, and worked on restoring my physical health. But I’m still on edge. My hyper vigilance and fractured trust make it hard to feel safe anywhere or with anyone. I just have paranoid fears that anyone could be affiliated with my rapists because I have never encountered organized crime before??? I come from a expensive suburb, I have professional and strict parents and I myself am very straight laced so like this made me lose my mind. I have never seen the world of crime before and I never want to again.

18433,1i369k1,post,Family Secret Wearing Me Out,"Been holding onto this secret for a few years now. But I must make this known since my family and friends aren't an option. I just need to get this off my chest somewhere:

My sister married her oldest daughter's child molester. It happened once and never again, yet the pain has been boiling inside me since this all came out nearly a decade ago. 

It shouldn't be my position to do this or to have this much concern, as my sister would say since her heart's is sort of cold. But I love my niece and that is all the reason why I have been ignoring her stepfather and keeping firm with keeping him out of my way. The pain that she experienced then also became my own when she came up to me with it after confessing to it in 2015.

2015: My niece was in middle school when she first mentioned it. It all came out first when her mom found out that she was cutting her wrists and didn't tell anybody about it until her mother's suspicions were up on why she was covering her wrists so much. I knew about the cutting a few days before this day, but I told her to stop cutting herself and I wouldn't tell anybody, knowing it'd cause a huge ruckus and to avoid stress since our family had been dealing with a lot then. But it still came out. I do regret not handling that better.

My niece finally explained why she was cutting herself: it was because her [mom's] boyfriend molested her when she was in elementary school in 2010 and that when she told her mother, nothing came of it. My sister's family all lived in a different household, so this was all between them at the time. At then, her mother was overworked and tired from her job. So when she was brought up with the situation, she dismissed it thinking my niece was tired and overthinking it. And of course, my niece was also dismissed emotionally. I didn't know this happened at all until that day on 2015, I just thought my niece was in an edgy phase. 

So there started a huge internal family fight that day among the immediates. My sister's boyfriend then was denying it, but my sister wanted to be there for her daughter more. Because there were issues with his immigration (he left the country on vacation while having a felony unaddressed and then came back, risking deportation and thousands of dollars of my sister's money, dumbass), we were all thinking it was curtains for his time in the US and that he wouldn't be able to see his kids anymore if this all were to come out, if it were true. He was suicidal at that point (what a man child honestly). My sister was real mad and was comforting my niece on the whole ordeal. Though eventually, my sister knew that she needed him as a father figure for the boys and income. So...they all decided to keep it quiet. They let me in on it because they knew I was the most righteous one in the family and let me know why. I wasn't all right with it, but it was out of my control. And plus, I wasn't even so sure if it happened. Regrettably while knowing my limits, I continued life as is until more came out of it. Eventually he did confess though. He even told his parents. When he told his mother, her mother ran out of the house without muttering one word in tears. Life somehow became normal and we just all coped with it. 

Though in 2019 it'd be shaken up. My niece confessed about the molestation at school with her social worker, and her social workers took her. My niece was kept in a facility as an inpatient case, and she was real anxious about what she had done and all the commotion it caused, her brothers were asking where she was (they didn't know about the molestation). And the whole situation came unearthed again in my household. My mother became retired, relying on us for her to fund her bills. Custody of my sister's kids in general was risked, income of course risked, and yeah, there was just a lot going on. My niece eventually rescinded her confession, saying she did it out of spite, and the case was closed. 

Shortly after this, I talked with my niece about it, just said this was all unfortunate and we moved on with life saying that it's all based on survival psychology we put up with this until we can manage our own living situations. She even asked my why other immediate family members continue talking with him unlike me. I just said that they have no emotional depth to process the situation and just try to treat things as if they were normal as a cope since they may not know how. They do not like change or complicating things.

Confessing something like this is hard, because families can almost immediately be homeless in certain situations. There are probably a ton of situations where the victim also rely on the offender.

Throughout the years, I've coped about knowing this. I get so riled up it triggers my own health anxiety, thinking I might have a medical emergency just stressing over this. Especially knowing that my sister eventually married him, got his name tattooed on her and adopted his last name. And I know that even keeping this secret might even be a crime maybe. 

A couple of times she's cheated on him. Hell, I knew she was capable of better, but she just locked herself into a shitty situation. My and my sister don't have the best relationship, it is very fragile and conflicted most of the time. But she knows I don't like him or tolerate it. Actually, she was a victim of sexual assault when she was younger, too. She had nobody to be there for her (I was too young to process it). And I just can't believe that she basically doubled down on her husband. I have to assume that it's all survival psychology, which is the saddest part. If we were all financially stable and could be more independent, we all probably would have ditched him better. I just feel pathetic, powerless, and sad for my niece.

I do think that my sister knows what she's doing, too. Maybe she's faking it just to cope in some way. I mean I can't be the only sane person here, right? I can only imagine what she may be truly facing. She puts up a good act if it is one. She did try to cheat, so I'm hopeful that she doesn't actually love him. 

Enough about me, my niece told me she is traumatized by it. She thinks it's all sad how things are, how the immediate family acts like nothing happened, and that we're all stuck in this financial relationship and living situation. But she's been doing fine, and she's been more religious to cope with certain things in life, especially with the event that took place. I sought her forgiveness and she gave it to me, knowing the situation we're all in. I'm very thankful to know I have such a wonderful niece.

It's hard for me to accept that he's needed for them. Right now I'm jobless (have been since experiencing an event, will turn it around hopefully) and still living under the same family home they're in. I've been dealing with some big obstacles in my life that I won't delve into. But I will say that being here knowing he's chatting with my family like normal when they know what he did just breaks my heart. I'm the only one who will ignore him. I've asked other immediate family why they still talk to him, and it's because they just want to help my sister out. So maybe they're all just faking it. I just feel stuck, and that facing this guy everyday is a pain in my heart. I can't talk about it with extended family since it would break like wildfire. My friends don't deserve the stress but two of them know. Can't talk to it with therapists directly for concerns of risking all of our living situations. I've confessed to a therapist, but in between words. I do think maybe he has a hint of where I'm coming fom though. They think I'm experiencing a form of trauma called secondary trauma, reacting to their trauma.

But there, that's what's been in my head since I first knew about it in 2015, and in 2019 it just became worse. My mind's been stressing over it hard the past few years for some reason, and was thinking that maybe the pain of facing this reality might soften just writing this up. Ironically, my niece is handling it much better than me.

TL;DR:
Sister married niece's child molester. Lives with in the family house with her family and my immediate family with my mom. He contributes with income and is an active father. If secret goes out, living situation is ruined. Niece and I tolerate it, but it stresses us sometimes everyone else acts like nothing happened for survival psychology. I get stressed to the point of feeling like I'm going to have a medical emergency about it sometimes. Niece tolerates it better than me. I feel powerless and sad about it while dealing with my own things. I see and hear him everyday and it pains me. Coping is hard sometimes.

Almost everyone I’ve opened up to about it seems to believe that it’s my own fault or what I deserve or something like that, but even if things had gone better I still don’t think my odds would improve much.

I’ve heard that there’s someone out there for everyone, but a quick look at statistics on this stuff reveals that that’s definitely not true.

I really don’t like being single (and to boot society more or less hates single women), but I’m not sure what choice I have at this point. I’m coming to terms with it a little at a time, and maybe a miracle will happen, but for now it’s tearing me apart to know that I will never experience love in that way.

18436,1i293e9,post,I didn't help a rape victim,"I'm not sure if this is the appropriate subreddit to talk about this

I'm 18. Yesterday I was walking to class at 3pm and after some minutes of living my house, a woman asked me to stop. We where in the middle of the street with more people, and she asked me if I could share some mobile data with her because she needed to call the police, but I lied to her and told her I had no data. She kept insisting she needed to call the police and then I told her I could give her indications on where the police station was since it wasn't that far away, but she told me she already knew where it was, but she needed to take some people by surprise. She pointed at a building and said there were people doing hard drugs in there, and they had a lot of them. She kept insisting on me sharing some mobile data to her, and I suggested to use the phone of a bar we were next to but she said nothing to that. There used to be a public phone on the street we were in and told her about it, not too sure because I didn't remember well if it still was still there but I led her there anyway, just to notice it wasn't there anymore. On the way she told me again they had a lot of drugs and that they raped her. They drugged her and raped her. I didn't know what to say, and just apologized, told her to use the phone at the bar and I was in a rush. She just looked at me, turned around and left, I wished her good luck while she walked away.

As I went back on my way to school I started feeling really bad. I already felt bad for her, but I started feeling guilty. I did nothing to actually help her. I needed to tell someone what happened but I was afraid of them hating me because of it. When I got back home I ended up telling my mother what happened and she told me not to worry about it because she thinks she wanted to rob me because there were more people on the street and we were next to a couple of stablishments in which she could've called the police.

Even if it was true that she wanted to rob me, I still feel terrible about how I acted. I barely did anything for a woman that was asking for help because she was sexually assaulted and just left","I didn't help a rape victim I'm not sure if this is the appropriate subreddit to talk about this

As I went back on my way to school I started feeling really bad. I already felt bad for her, but I started feeling guilty. I did nothing to actually help her. I needed to tell someone what happened but I was afraid of them hating me because of it. When I got back home I ended up telling my mother what happened and she told me not to worry about it because she thinks she wanted to rob me because there were more people on the street and we were next to a couple of stablishments in which she could've called the police.

Even if it was true that she wanted to rob me, I still feel terrible about how I acted. I barely did anything for a woman that was asking for help because she was sexually assaulted and just left",0,0,2025-01-15 22:02,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1i293e9/i_didnt_help_a_rape_victim/,Victim
18437,1i1ujfv,post,My mom has destroyed my life ,"My mom and my dad had a messy relationship. My mom blames it on the fact that she was sexually abused as a child by a parent figure. She “acted out sexually” in her words (aka she cheated on my dad from the beginning of their marriage) and by the time I was 3 they were separated. She came back and left and came back and left for years until they finally officially divorced when I was around 9 or 10. I can’t express how much it hurt coming home to find out my mom had left me again, usually for some guy she found online. 

My mom has never been there for me consistently and I feel as if she has never really understood me. When I was young enough that I didn’t really know how wrong it was, she sexually abused me. I can only remember one time, and it wasn’t like a common thing, but nonetheless when I grew up and realized what had happened it just shocked me so much. I cannot believe someone who has gone through that herself would ever put that on her own daughter. And I think some part of her broke because of that. Ever since then, she’s favored my older sibling. They have always been the golden child, can do no wrong, here let me help you with everything. They say jump she says how high. It’s always been that way. And I’m not just projecting this, that sibling has willingly admitted to me that they see it. They see the favoritism. 

Beyond that my mom has always been manipulative and mean and hurtful to me. She seems nice and you start to trust her and you tell her stuff about your life and then later she uses that information to hurt you, or to justify her hurtful actions. All growing up she told me she wanted custody of me but that “the courts” wouldn’t let her. When I was 14 suddenly that changed and she said I was old enough to chose and I could chose to live with her… that’s when I found out that she had never actually taught for custody, had handed it over to my father willingly on the condition she didn’t have to pay child support… until I was 14 years old. And as soon as I was 14 suddenly she wanted me to move in with her. 

Every “loving” thing she does has these other reasons. I’m not even sure she actually likes me in the least. She spent most of my childhood manipulating me and making me feel so small and unlovable. She would always say or do seemingly innocuous or even kind things that ultimately hurt me in the end. Like she would let me borrow her phone as a kid to text my friends, and later I found out she was reading my messages and tracking my search history. She bought me a phone so “we can talk when I’m away” but anytime she was upset with me she’d have it get disconnected. 

She loved to complain about her bio dad being a “horrible” parent for not being around, and it always felt pointed. Like one year she was like “happy birthday you’re finally an adult!!!!” Which made no sense cause it was my 23rd birthday???? and then that same year she sent me a screenshot from her dad where he had said happy birthday a few days early and captioned it “he doesn’t even know my birthday. That’s true absentee parenting” and whenever I mentioned anything even slightly problematic she had done she always dismisses it with a “well my mom/dad did worse and I never [insert behavior she was annoyed by]” (important note is that the parents she refers to when she does this is never the parent figure who sexually abused her. It’s always either her absentee bio dad, or her mother, but never the parent-figure who assaulted her) 

One time I needed clothes for a job and asked her to help me find some. I am not comfortable in revealing clothes and so I gave her a dress code (all clothes must have sleeves and go to the knees). She found the tightest possible dresses and was like “this is perfect, show off your curves” which was the exact thing I was trying to prevent with a dress code. She knew that. I was clear. When I said it was uncomfortable she called me a prude. 

I could go on for days. A million little small slights my whole life scattered by a few awful moment. She’d go off the rails and scream and yell and threaten to kill herself. She’d forget me at school, or she’d yell at me for not doing something. Once she was annoyed at me at a theme park and she had a purse full of quarters and she smacked me with it. Just small things like that, but all the time. My whole childhood. 

But as an adult, things with her have been worse. A few years ago I had a miscarriage. It was maybe the most emotionally painful experience of my life and I originally wasn’t going to tell her, but I was afraid if she found out I had been in the hospital without letting her know she would go crazy, so I told her. I asked her not to tell anyone, I didn’t want people to know. I told exactly 3 people, my dad, my mother, and my boss (needed a few days off work). I didn’t tell my grandparents or my siblings, or my best friend. After a few weeks I was ready to tell people and I called my grandma and she admitted my mom had told her, the day of. I asked my mom, and she said “oh no, I didn’t tell anyone” then I shared that grandma had admitted she knew. And my mom didn’t apologize, but said “well your grandma promised not to mention thag I told. I can’t believe she’d do that.” I was astonished. Instead of admitting what she did wrong, she acted like my grandma was in the wrong for not concealing the breech of trust. I told my mom how hurt I was that she shared that information when I had asked her not to and she just said “it was too painful for me to bear alone”. 

It wasn’t her pain to share with anyone after I explicitly told her not to. So I told her I needed space. I didn’t talk to her really for about a year but cutting her out of my life was painful and I missed her in spite of everything. So I tried to mend fences. 

Things were okay until Christmas. She gave me this book in front of my whole family, and it was titled like “the forgiveness journal” or something. When she handed me the book she kinda laughed and said “oh you may hate this gift” and I thought “why would you give me a gift that you KNOW I wouldn’t like?” It was so awkward and embarrassing opening that book. It felt like she was calling me out in front of everyone. The book had an inscription talking about how she also struggles to forgive people and it was really hurtful. It felt like she was telling me “your lack of ability to forgive is the problem in our relationship, not the actions I’ve taken that need forgiving” and a few days after Christmas I let her know, kindly in a text, why I felt that gift was inappropriate and asked her to not give me self help books in the future unless explicitly asked. I needed a few days to cool down so I muted her messages. A week went by and she called me crying asking for forgiveness but then no less than 2 minutes in she was crying and justifying her actions. “If anyone ever gave me a gift I would just be grateful. Even if it was a bug. Because it means they care. When I was younger my mom gave me awful gifts and I never said anything about how I didn’t like them.” And on and on and explaining that she “shopped her house” for the gift cause she couldn’t afford to spend more money to make my gift numbers equal this year and I had one less gift than my sibling. By the end I was annoyed and sad and angry, and honestly a bit worried I’d overreacted. It took multiple conversations with my husband to realize that no, my reaction was more than justified. 

She’s crying and upset that I have chosen on occasion to leave our relationship when it’s too painful for me. She complains that she’s hurt when I say I don’t need her. I want to yell at her of course I dont need her. She left me when I was 3 and again when I was 4 and 6 and 7, and 9. She moved around my whole childhood. Never lived one place for long. Always with a boyfriend who was never within a reasonable commute. I learned to grow up without her. And I’m an adult now. Of course I dont need her. She wasn’t there when I did, so I learned how not to need her.

But looking forward, I’m scared. I’ve been in therapy off and on since I was a teen. I’ve been battling depression since I was 12. I attempted suicide in high school. And in therapy I’m learning that most (not all. I also grew up undiagnosed autistic which probably compounded my trauma, plus I haven’t always been the nicest to myself which again doesn’t help. I’m not like trying to blame her for all my issues) of my problems boil down to my relationship with my mom. I struggle to show love and share my feelings because I spent so long protecting them. I learned growing up that if you love something you keep that secret or else you’ll lose it. I’m furious at her, at how she’s damaged me, how she’s tainted my whole childhood and much of my adult life. How she will continue to do so no matter how I react. If I let her stay in my life she’ll continue being as she is, and if I cut her out, her absence will haunt me. And in spite of all that, I love her too. My husband struggles to help me through it. I’ve had a therapist literally tell me my issues are “too much for me to handle” and give up on me. I’m well into my 20s and I’m still reeling from my childhood. I don’t know how or if I can ever be emotional stable enough to have children of my own. I’m terrified that one day I’ll turn into her. I flinch when my husband tries to hug me. I just… I have no idea how to move past this. I want desperately to, but a part of me is scared that my mom destroyed my life before I ever had a chance to live it.

18438,1i05p26,post,My ex was accused of rape at his old university. ,"TW for sexual assault and probably some domestic violence type talk. I don’t know how to put what happened to me into words.

this all starts about two years ago, when my ex and i started our relationship. At the time I was a virgin and had been sexually assaulted multiple times in the past. He was supportive of me and readily was tested for STDs, was open about his own history and answered every single question I had for him regarding the topic. I even asked him if he had ever been accused of raping someone and he said no. I trusted him and after a few months, we began having sex.  

about a month after giving him my virginity I get a DM from another one of his exes telling me that he had been accused of raping a girl at his old university and she only found out because the police from that university called him while they were together and he couldn’t get around it. I immediately deleted the DM and called him. He told me it was all a misunderstanding and miscommunication and i believed him because i wanted to. he told me that the only people who knew about it were the people he was friends with at his old university, his parents, me, and his ex. 

I don’t think I’ll ever know what happened because he was the one who told me, but he was either kicked out of the university or basically shunned by his friends and fraternity until he left. I can’t find a criminal record for him and I don’t think he ever faced any legal action.. this is not at all soothing because I know from experience that even if you report sexual violence, the likelihood of it being brought to justice is low. 

As our relationship continued, we never talked about it again. I never told anybody except for my closest friends. It ate away at me every single day and I felt sick to my stomach thinking about it, but I didn’t know why. There were occasions where i would tease him by nibbling/biting playfully on him, or push him into a wall to kiss him, and it would be met by forcing me on my knees and shoving my face into his crotch by my hair until I said i was sorry- or being backed across the room and chokeslammed into a matress. He would sometimes cover my mouth while we had sex (that i originally consented to) and not uncover it- we had roommates, sure, but i didn’t like it and told him as much. I also always tried to fight him on it while it happened. 

Finally, i was home alone at his place one morning while he was at work (about a year after i heard from his ex via DM). I ended up looking something up on Reddit and realized I was on his account which I didn’t know that he had. Out of curiosity, I clicked on his account to see if he had posted anything anywhere (i honestly assumed he hasn’t I was just curious) and found that he had posted some disturbing things on a rape fantasy subreddit. That, coupled with my experiences with him and his past, made me sick to my stomach.

He broke up with me several months ago, and I don’t know how to move on and be OK with myself knowing what I know. I’m in a very happy relationship now with someone who loves me so much more and I feel so safe with them, but my experiences haunt me. I want proof of what happened at his old school. I want proof of what happened to me. I wish she hadn’t lied to me because now my entire experience- over a year of my life- feels completely wasted on a lie I chose to believe because I didn’t know what else to do.

18439,1hzze6w,post,I refuse to give up ,"

We went to a small HS, 30 people in a class.  We were a group of 4 friends, we were all 16 , Me ,F ,Q and B. Originally F and B had feelings for each other ,but F ended up with Q. All was fine ,i was super happy i had a group of friends finally after years. 

But it soon turned out rhat Q and F had a very toxic relationship , he was controling what she ate etc. Eventually they broke up, 2 months before F was going to move half way across the globe. 

Now Q had a history , he was suspended when we ere 13 for touching girls in the hallway. We had an intervention ,to talk about it , but it just resulted in all the guys hating on the girls for causing stupid drama over nothing. And he continued to touch girls, not only at school , also grabbing their crotches in movie theaters ,and the girls all hid it. 

So he didn't take the break up. Now , he threw a party. We went there , cause F didnt want any drama before she left. They endes up getting drunk and having a fight ,B and I were playing negotiators and mitigatoea between them. Eventually we left them to talk it out ,only for F to run out of the room and tell me crying, ""he tried to put it in me"" 

Now I went insane , I went to talk with B outside , and told him he cannot incite Q to the party at his house next week (Q and B lived 5 mins walk from each other) he said he cant chose between friends. Also F said to invite him because she was leaving soon. 

So next week comes, and F told me "" dont let me be alone with him"". But she got drunk, Q and her , after my protest, went to Qs house so she could pick up her stuff.

They come back 2h later ,shes crying and tells me ,he tried again ,when they were upstairs and his parenrs were downstairs. 

I go livid I tell B to kick Q out. He keeps saying he cant chose friends. We talk for hours outside whike the party is inside. 

Then at 23:22 someone comes and says , Q and F went upstairs alone. I rush in the house and walk into Bs bedroom to find Q taking Fs pants off. He tells me to fuck off as I stand in the doorway with B behind me

And then its all a blur , thanks to emdr I remember some of it. I pushed him off of F , and B is just standing shocked in the doorway . I keep ""screaming B do something!"" And Q keeps screaming that im insane. Eventually B does kick Q out. F turna out to be unconcious. She was till the next day. In the morning I decided to tell her what happened. 

Couple days later he threw a letter in her mailbox twisting the whole thing, saying hell forgive her etc. And its sick. On her birthday ,he even climbed up to her window ,to see her. We told him to fuck off. Soon after she moved. 

I couldnt do nothing. I gathered all the girls who were victims and we all went to the school board. Long story short , they couldnt do anything. It also turned out his suspension was never official , no record of it. I was angry , the only thing they offered is for *US* to make an educational presentation to younger classes so this doesnt happen to them. The worst part ,I had to convince my friends to cut contact with Q , but in the end I was the one who lost most of them. Because ""who cares ,not their buisness"" , even though our whole class was at that party. They saw what state she was in. 

He ended up moving away a year later. I reported him to the police , for my own sanity and went to get therapy. 

But man its been rough since then. I mean it wasn't easy before. I got beaten by my "" friends"" since I was 9.  But after the event , I had 2 friends attempt suicide , one from the us and I had lost contact for 2 weeks as she was in the hospital. 

I saw a man die infront of my infront of my house in a car accident. I tried to pull him put of the car but I was too scared it would blow up. I spoke to his son. I felt awful 

I got sent death threats before my end exams by my friends who thought this joke would be a nice date idea. Got diagnosed with ADHD and autism. 

When I was 18 I got sexually assaulted (albeit only grabbed by my ass ) , got groomed by my brothers friend (he was 34). Got threatend to get raped if my friend wasnt with me at a train station.  Almost attempted suicide (thank god that my bf stopped me).

I was bitten by a dog last year ,got told by my grandma I need a whip not a therapist. She said I have no real reason to be suicidal. I lost all my HS ""friends"" because I rejected a guy and he turned them all against me , organising a secret vote to cut contact with me , some of them which i saved from being expelled (long story , i was quite influencial in my school) , although now im better for it ,fuck them , they are junkies and losers, but it was hard not gonna lie. 

I was bullied , like beaten by my friends because they thought I was annoying since I was 9. My mother is a narcisist, who doesnt believe in my adhd and respecting my boundries ,told me she cant change and I should cut contact if i dont like it. 


Im so tired. I just turned 20 , but life is taking a good turn finally . Im proud of who ive become ,but man , I am tired and those nightmares haunt me. I refused to give up. I have a loving boyfriend who tolerates my shit and my trauma. I have 2 real friends , I dont need more.  Im doing 2 bachelors in 2 different countries both in stem , Im working for my future. I refuse to lose my heart. I go out my way to help people in need when I see them. Buy ice cream on a hot day for construction workers , help old ladies with their groceries ,etc. I refuse to become like the people who hurt me. 

I guess I wanted to get this off my chest , its been hard ,im tired ,but i will get back up . And so will you dear reader , no matter the hardship. Just keep your heart.  ","I refuse to give up  

We went to a small HS, 30 people in a class.  We were a group of 4 friends, we were all 16 , Me ,F ,Q and B. Originally F and B had feelings for each other ,but F ended up with Q. All was fine ,i was super happy i had a group of friends finally after years. 

But it soon turned out rhat Q and F had a very toxic relationship , he was controling what she ate etc. Eventually they broke up, 2 months before F was going to move half way across the globe. 

Now Q had a history , he was suspended when we ere 13 for touching girls in the hallway. We had an intervention ,to talk about it , but it just resulted in all the guys hating on the girls for causing stupid drama over nothing. And he continued to touch girls, not only at school , also grabbing their crotches in movie theaters ,and the girls all hid it. 

So he didn't take the break up. Now , he threw a party. We went there , cause F didnt want any drama before she left. They endes up getting drunk and having a fight ,B and I were playing negotiators and mitigatoea between them. Eventually we left them to talk it out ,only for F to run out of the room and tell me crying, ""he tried to put it in me"" 

Now I went insane , I went to talk with B outside , and told him he cannot incite Q to the party at his house next week (Q and B lived 5 mins walk from each other) he said he cant chose between friends. Also F said to invite him because she was leaving soon. 

So next week comes, and F told me "" dont let me be alone with him"". But she got drunk, Q and her , after my protest, went to Qs house so she could pick up her stuff.

They come back 2h later ,shes crying and tells me ,he tried again ,when they were upstairs and his parenrs were downstairs. 

I go livid I tell B to kick Q out. He keeps saying he cant chose friends. We talk for hours outside whike the party is inside. 

Then at 23:22 someone comes and says , Q and F went upstairs alone. I rush in the house and walk into Bs bedroom to find Q taking Fs pants off. He tells me to fuck off as I stand in the doorway with B behind me

And then its all a blur , thanks to emdr I remember some of it. I pushed him off of F , and B is just standing shocked in the doorway . I keep ""screaming B do something!"" And Q keeps screaming that im insane. Eventually B does kick Q out. F turna out to be unconcious. She was till the next day. In the morning I decided to tell her what happened. 

Couple days later he threw a letter in her mailbox twisting the whole thing, saying hell forgive her etc. And its sick. On her birthday ,he even climbed up to her window ,to see her. We told him to fuck off. Soon after she moved. 

I couldnt do nothing. I gathered all the girls who were victims and we all went to the school board. Long story short , they couldnt do anything. It also turned out his suspension was never official , no record of it. I was angry , the only thing they offered is for *US* to make an educational presentation to younger classes so this doesnt happen to them. The worst part ,I had to convince my friends to cut contact with Q , but in the end I was the one who lost most of them. Because ""who cares ,not their buisness"" , even though our whole class was at that party. They saw what state she was in. 

He ended up moving away a year later. I reported him to the police , for my own sanity and went to get therapy. 

But man its been rough since then. I mean it wasn't easy before. I got beaten by my "" friends"" since I was 9.  But after the event , I had 2 friends attempt suicide , one from the us and I had lost contact for 2 weeks as she was in the hospital. 

I saw a man die infront of my infront of my house in a car accident. I tried to pull him put of the car but I was too scared it would blow up. I spoke to his son. I felt awful 

I got sent death threats before my end exams by my friends who thought this joke would be a nice date idea. Got diagnosed with ADHD and autism. 

When I was 18 I got sexually assaulted (albeit only grabbed by my ass ) , got groomed by my brothers friend (he was 34). Got threatend to get raped if my friend wasnt with me at a train station.  Almost attempted suicide (thank god that my bf stopped me).

I was bitten by a dog last year ,got told by my grandma I need a whip not a therapist. She said I have no real reason to be suicidal. I lost all my HS ""friends"" because I rejected a guy and he turned them all against me , organising a secret vote to cut contact with me , some of them which i saved from being expelled (long story , i was quite influencial in my school) , although now im better for it ,fuck them , they are junkies and losers, but it was hard not gonna lie.

18440,1hzcyu4,post,RCMP Destroyed My Life,"I have been under surveillance by the RCMP since 2011. I have no ties to criminals or extremism whatsoever. No extreme ideologies or political beleifs. I am not religeous although my family is Muslim. There is absolutely nothing that would indicate that I am a threat to our society. In fact I love Canada, I was born here and have always been a big proponent for our most fundamental values.

I know people will question why I would be targeted but I assure you, I am not an attention seeker nor do I have any reason to make any of this up. The fact is that I had a falling out with someone who works for the RCMP and it all started after that. It really is clear cut and there is no doubt in my mind that the RCMP put me on a list and have systematically isolated me, defamed me and dismantled my entire life.

What I have experienced is that they have a ridiculous budget. Their ability to recruit informants and turn friends and family agaisnt you is incredible. They can take anybody they want and destroy their life by abusing their power and bribery. These informants know that I am not a threat but the sheer monetary compensation keeps them from questioning their morals and.ethics.

Before this all started I knew that these organizations were corrupt and that they had done this to innocent people but to experience it first hand - it is MUCH worse than anyone could possibly imagine. It is difficult to explain the psychological impact they have had over such an extended period of time. It is as though everything you do is some ""test"" and they expect you to make certain decisions based on thei narrative they have created and when that doesn't happen they get angry about it and manipulate the outcome to cover up the truth. It makes it extremely difficult to live a normal life.

 I guess the best way to describe it is that their tunnel vision is so strong that they end up taking good people and turn them into the very thing they are mandated to stop in the first place. It is only because of my self awareness, perception, kindness and good upbringing that I have remained fairly positive and grounded despite the clear injustice.

To this day I can say with absolute honesty, an international police organization had no reason whatsoever to target someone like.me. Without any reasoning they stole.my one life to live and continue to do so despite everything they have already taken from me and there is nothing that I can do about it because the RCMP are quite literally god.

It is very difficult for me to see police constantly doing things like sexually assaulting women and drinking and driving and shooting innocent people and getting paid suspensions and meaningless demotions while my entire life is being destroyed over and over again for something I didn't do. It just goes to show how unequal and biased our society truly is.","RCMP Destroyed My Life I have been under surveillance by the RCMP since 2011. I have no ties to criminals or extremism whatsoever.

I have a difficult history with my body and self-image due to some past traumas. I’ve been sexually assaulted and was the target of intense workplace sexual harassment. Both of these experiences left deep scars, both physically and emotionally. On top of that, I’ve struggled with self-harm over the years, leaving visible marks on my body. Suffice to say, comments about my body affect me deeply.

Between the trauma and the scars, I’m very sensitive about comments regarding my appearance. I see a therapist regularly and take multiple medications for PTSD and related issues. My sister-in-law (SIL) is aware of all of this.

During Christmas, my wife’s siblings flew in to visit, including my SIL. On the last night of their stay, she made an out-of-pocket comment about a relatively intimate part of my body and what she thinks I should do to “improve” it.

It was random, unexpected, and deeply hurtful. I didn’t address it in the moment, but later that night, I had a panic attack.

The next day, after everyone had left, I sent my SIL a message explaining how hurt I was by her comment and how it affected me. That was two weeks ago, and she’s left me on read ever since. No acknowledgment, no apology, and no attempt to repair our relationship.

Given her awareness of my history and how sensitive I am about these topics, I feel like this was a betrayal of trust. I don’t know if I can move past this, especially without any effort on her part to make amends.

I've always been depressed due to sexual abuse and assault I have experienced when I was younger, because of this I ended up developing a fear of men. Originally both me and my family had no clue what had happened as my brain had forcefully suppressed what had happened but in middle school I randomly remembered everything but the face of the man who abused me. I was put into therapy after that and it helped me progress a lot in my fear of men but eventually I had to stop going as our medical provider at the time had cancelled our insurance. I didn't go back to therapy and had to deal with my depression and suicidal thoughts by myself during my high school years. High school wasn't any better since covid hit my junior year, by the time it lifted I was already in my senior year and failing. I was in such a deep depression that I wagered my life on whether I graduated or not and obviously if you are reading this post I somehow managed to scrap by. I didn't think I would ever made it to 18 but somehow there I was graduated and an official adult with no clue what I want to do with my life.

  
My original plan after high school was to take a year break since my mental health was in the gutter and just work but one year turned to two and now we're going on four. I've been floating around from job to job since then and am lucky enough to live with my parent but that's its own problem. I don't feel like I'm actually a part of my family, every time I'm in their company I always feel like I'm a stranger who's been invited to their family dinners out of pity. My relationship with my father is strained as he is frustrated with the fact that I have done nothing since high school and always chews me out every couple of months telling me I need to go to school already. The only people who I feel comfortable with are my friends and cousins who have been amazing support and I love dearly but I know I can't depend on them for everything and feel like I'm dragging them down with my existence and mediocre friendship. I always feel empty and like I have no purpose in life so I have animals to feel like at least someone needs me. My fish are my babies and my friend got me a chinchilla for my birthday but its been a struggle with him.

  
Currently I work part time at a job that pays me scraps and started seeing a therapist that one of my cousins helped me get access to. I've also recently been diagnose with BPD and have been taking meds, according to my doctor I have been having manic episodes so theres that too. Those things only take up about two days of the week leaving me nothing but free time for the other 5 days which I would say is actually six since my therapy appointments are only about an hour. my friends are usually always busy being adults which leaves even more alone and isolated so I spend most of the day sleeping, scrolling through my phone or just thinking. My creativity has completely run dry and even though I yearn to create I can't anymore. All I can do is reflect on my life and ponder over the fact that I've never had any drive and now that I'm getting older the responsibilities of being an adult are starting to weigh on me. I still don't know what I want to do and feel like I have no purpose besides just being there for others but when I'm not needed then what good am I? I wouldn't exactly say I'm suicidal as I have no interest in killing myself but I do find myself wishing that I just never existed in the first place.

18445,1hxci69,post,I Offered to Be a Sperm Donor for Someone Close to Me. It Ended in Heartbreak.,"I offered to be a sperm donor for someone close to me (we’ll call her Katie). That journey started back in 2023 when I was moved by a conversation Katie was having with her sister about her dream of being a mother. She was single with no romantic prospects and couldn’t afford to go through a clinic.

We had often talked about how much we love and appreciate each other, and how we see each other as siblings. So I felt convicted to help her if I could. I reached out to make the offer, which she enthusiastically accepted—even admitting she had considered asking me.

We approached a lawyer to draw up a legal agreement to ensure I was just a donor with no parental rights or responsibilities. I completed the usual pre-conception medical work, and we had our first attempt in November 2023.

Things were going well. This shared experience seemed to bring us closer. We were more vulnerable with each other than ever before. It was a positive, uplifting time for us both.

NO, WE ARE NOT ROMANTICALLY INVOLVED. Our relationship is more akin to siblings or best friends. There’s zero romance there, and it’s important to make that clear.

[Content warning: Discussion of intimate assault]

In mid-2024, I was intimately violated by someone. This experience—and the wounds it reopened from a previous sexual assault—broke me. I’m now dealing with PTSD, constant panic attacks, self-harm, suicidal ideation, and other psychological injuries. That’s its own story, but I mention it here to give context to how it impacted my dynamic with Katie.

This trauma derailed our relationship in two key ways:

Firstly, I fought through the destruction of my libido to keep my commitment to her. Even now, I’m effectively asexual. When I do feel an inclination toward intimacy, things just… don’t work. Medication resolved the physical side of things, but emotionally, I was struggling. I still am. My only sexual activity was my monthly donation, and it became a grueling process. Still, I pushed through because I valued my promise to Katie.

Secondly, I sought out safe harbors—people I felt emotionally safe with. The world became a very scary place for me. Katie was one of the few people I leaned on heavily, far too heavily. The emotional burden I placed on her wasn’t fair, and it eventually made her uncomfortable.

The conversation came where she told me she wanted to explore using a clinic and an anonymous donor. While I felt a little rejected, I understood.

But then Katie let slip something that crushed me. She admitted she had decided to end our arrangement months earlier but continued using me for donations until she had her first clinic appointment.

That revelation hit hard.

I would have completely supported her decision to move on and would’ve been her biggest cheerleader. But learning she had already made the decision and continued using me felt like a betrayal. I no longer felt like a trusted friend—I felt like a commodity. Given my history of trauma, this was devastating.

The closest analogy I can think of is this: Imagine an intimate partner telling you they want to break up. You understand—it happens. But then they reveal they decided to end things months ago and kept being intimate with you until they found someone new. It would be hard not to feel used or objectified.

That’s how I felt.

Katie’s choice to explore other pathways to conception was never the issue. Her decision to use me for months, knowing my history and the impact of her actions, destroyed my trust in her.

We had a few difficult conversations after that. She seemed to understand, showed some remorse, and I thought we might be able to rebuild.

Fast forward to Christmas 2025. Katie spent it with my family. Before her visit, I set clear boundaries (no hugging, kissing, etc.) to address the objectification issue.

The visit seemed to go well—until the night before she left. She was at the table with her sisters, and I overheard part of their conversation about me. When I asked them to repeat what was said, Katie told me, “You need to do more squats so you can have a more defined ass.”

In that moment, everything shattered again. After all our conversations about objectification and boundaries, she did it again—this time in front of an audience.

I was done.

I didn’t want to ruin the rest of her visit, so I kept things civil until I dropped her at the airport. But as soon as I dropped her off, I messaged her to say how hurt I was, how much damage her comment caused, and that I needed to go low contact for my emotional safety. I told her I was still open to reconciliation if she was willing to meet me halfway.

She’s left me on read, and that’s where my story ends.

I’m mourning the loss of a 15-year relationship with someone I loved like family. I don’t know if reconciliation is possible, but right now, I need to prioritise my healing.

Thank you for reading, and I’m sorry for the long post.

Edit for clarity:

Thank you all so much for your kind words and DMs. I didn’t expect this post to get the response it did, and I deeply appreciate everyone who took the time to engage with it.

I wanted to respond to a few common thoughts and clarify some details:

1. Please don’t hate Katie. I don’t. I still love and care about her very much, which is why the breakdown of our relationship has been so painful. As I mentioned, I leaned on her far too heavily than was reasonable after my assault. That wasn’t fair to her, and I completely understand why she felt the need to end our arrangement to protect herself. My issue isn’t that she ended things—it’s about the timing, the way it was handled, and some of the things she did and said that hurt me during and after.

2. Katie was supportive of my challenges. I was upfront with her about everything affecting my ability to donate, and she was always patient and understanding, even when I needed medication or struggled emotionally.

3. While I didn’t go into detail in the original post, I want to reassure everyone that I’m actively working on my healing. I do regular psychotherapy and take medication for my PTSD. It’s a slow process, but I’m making progress.  I might make a post about this journey someday.

4. Katie couldn’t afford to go through a clinic so we were doing the at-home thing with supplies bought online.

I’ll post another update if anything significant happens. Thank you again for your kindness and support.","I Offered to Be a Sperm Donor for Someone Close to Me. It Ended in Heartbreak. I offered to be a sperm donor for someone close to me (we’ll call her Katie). That journey started back in 2023 when I was moved by a conversation Katie was having with her sister about her dream of being a mother. She was single with no romantic prospects and couldn’t afford to go through a clinic.

We had often talked about how much we love and appreciate each other, and how we see each other as siblings. So I felt convicted to help her if I could. I reached out to make the offer, which she enthusiastically accepted—even admitting she had considered asking me.

We approached a lawyer to draw up a legal agreement to ensure I was just a donor with no parental rights or responsibilities. I completed the usual pre-conception medical work, and we had our first attempt in November 2023.

Things were going well. This shared experience seemed to bring us closer. We were more vulnerable with each other than ever before. It was a positive, uplifting time for us both.

NO, WE ARE NOT ROMANTICALLY INVOLVED. Our relationship is more akin to siblings or best friends. There’s zero romance there, and it’s important to make that clear.

[Content warning: Discussion of intimate assault]

In mid-2024, I was intimately violated by someone. This experience—and the wounds it reopened from a previous sexual assault—broke me. I’m now dealing with PTSD, constant panic attacks, self-harm, suicidal ideation, and other psychological injuries. That’s its own story, but I mention it here to give context to how it impacted my dynamic with Katie.

This trauma derailed our relationship in two key ways:

Firstly, I fought through the destruction of my libido to keep my commitment to her. Even now, I’m effectively asexual. When I do feel an inclination toward intimacy, things just… don’t work. Medication resolved the physical side of things, but emotionally, I was struggling. I still am. My only sexual activity was my monthly donation, and it became a grueling process. Still, I pushed through because I valued my promise to Katie.

Secondly, I sought out safe harbors—people I felt emotionally safe with. The world became a very scary place for me. Katie was one of the few people I leaned on heavily, far too heavily. The emotional burden I placed on her wasn’t fair, and it eventually made her uncomfortable.

I have a lot of anxiety, but this particular thing is more specific. Maybe some good background is that my mom has anxiety, depression, OCD, and PTSD, and my dad (who I am not in contact with) was abusive.

I have a major problem going to doctors. It's hard to explain why. I feel so much shame at other humans seeing my body. It's not so much that I fear they judge the aesthetics, but somehow I feel like they must think I'm gross for having parts that need to get checked out (specifically intimate exams).

Many years ago, I had some restrictive eating habits that stemmed from when my dad would constantly criticize my body and also my mom's body. I never had an eating disorder, but I worked out almost obsessively and counted calories and used food to punish myself. Once I had friends point out to me that this wasn't normal, I was able to stop it. I don't struggle with this anymore, but maybe it still comes into play.

My mom had an average body type when I was growing up, but my dad always called her disgusting, and I think that's how I view myself too. On a superficial level I know I am athletic and in shape and averagely attractive, but on a deeper level I feel like my body is just gross. I don't like to see myself naked in mirrors or even look at myself in the shower. Strangely, I have no problem going to European spas (all naked) or taking pole fitness classes where I have to wear minimal clothing.

Another part of it is that my earliest memory at a doctor visit was being held down while screaming so the doctor could draw blood. I was terrified and had no control. At a doctor now, I still feel totally powerless, and nakedness only adds to that.

Having a procedure like a gyno exam or breast exam is absolute torture. I feel violated (I am also a sexual assault survivor) but the main thing is just feeling so powerless and feeling like I am so ashamed of my own body. And I'm not sure how to change it. Like I said, it isn't about wishing I was thinner or anything like that. It's more like being ashamed of having sexual body parts.

I have to go to a doctor soon for an actual medical issue, and it keeps me up at night just thinking about it. I live in a country where modesty goes out the window at medical appointments, and feeling so exposed makes me sick and I lose the ability to advocate for myself when I'm just trying to get through it.

Does this make any sense? How do I begin to work through this?

18448,1hvzlo7,post,Toxic Ex Reached Out After No Contact,"TW // SA (discussed primarily at end of post)

Throughout high school and the early part of uni, I was in a relationship with X. X and I formed a very unhealthy codependent bond, and we remained this way for multiple years. Both of us did our fair share of hurtful things to each other. I had a lot of trust/jealousy issues which led to me questioning her intentions a lot, as well as being very clingy and revolving my life around her. She was very emotionally detached and would flirt with other people we knew. It got worst when she cheated on me with one of our mutual close friends. I stayed with her for another year after that before everything ended up reaching a breaking point. I ghosted her and (almost) everyone we were mutual friends with to avoid being in that environment. 

I am a very different person now. I was diagnosed with BPD (as well as C-PTSD, autism, and a few other things). I have done extensive therapy to manage my symptoms and emotions, and can say I have finally gotten to a point where my BPD doesn’t run my life. I am almost done my degree (after being a few years behind my peers due to mental health issues and switching majors). I am married to my best friend. I’m finally closer with my family again after the wedge X drove between us. I even have my own place which was never something I saw achievable. 

It was my birthday the other day and X texted me out of the blue. She had gotten a new number and decided to reach out after a few years of zero contact. She explained the situation where she cheated with our friend and how the person had pressured her into a situation where she couldn’t say no. She did apologize for the cheating (outside of that situation) and for generally not considering my feelings. 

It was very surreal. I never imagined she would EVER see her fault in the situation. Especially after she had bashed me online quite a lot previously, which I found out through the one mutual friend I had kept in contact with. I did appreciate what she said and I am proud of the growth she made. 

But having her apologizing for that aspect made me experience a lot of complicated feelings about the trauma I endured from her. It wasn’t JUST that our relationship was mutually toxic. She also had sexually assaulted me numerous times. Sometimes it was because I felt I couldn’t say no. Other times I would cry, tell her I was in pain and ask her to stop. She’d usually continue or stop and make me feel guilty until I eventually gave it. She had also admitted at the end of our relationship that she recognize that she used me for sex and that it was the only time we had any physical “affection”/intimacy. 

I had already suffered from CSA and SA throughout my teen years, which she was aware of and generally very insensitive about. I still struggle to not blame myself for that trauma. And now that she apologized for the cheating and toxic behaviour, and clearly grown as a person, I feel myself struggling to hold her accountable for what she did. I’ve caught myself trying to excuse her actions or justify what she did because of my toxic behaviour. I never imagined us speaking again, let alone her apologizing, so I had never anticipated having to deal with these feelings.

18449,1hv23bq,post,I don't know if my (F23) boyfriend (M25) cheated and it's killing me..,"This literally just happened around 3 hours ago so I'm sorry if this is messy. I'm still wrapping my brain around things. I know it's stupid to ask the internet to try and be nice...but I figure it's worth a shot.

I've been with my boyfriend for almost 3 years. We originally met through Tinder and it later blossomed into the beautiful thing we are now. We have been through a lot of rough patches with living situations, losing friends, etc, but have always stuck together. 

My boyfriend is recently going through a scare with his job, he's been suspended until further notice and we believe he may get fired. The details are unnecessary, but I decided I would help him with getting started on a resume and applying to jobs because he hasn't known how job applications have turned majorly complicated over the last 5 years. One of the things I decided to do (while next to him) was to start clearing out his emails that were full of spam, just in case someone emails him regarding a job. 

As I was looking through his emails, I saw a couple of emails that were from dating apps like Tinder, Hily, Ashley Madison, etc about joining earlier this year. It showed that he had just started a subscription to them too. I confronted him about it, to which he started to act shocked and like he didn't know what it was. I ask him to pull out his phone and he shows me his subscriptions on his app store, and they correlate with the emails. He starts to claim that he's never seen this before and maybe his email was hacked. Okay...but if his email is hacked why is the app store on his phone also showing that he downloaded the app and subscribed? An added detail is all that subscriptions say that he had ended/canceled them a few months ago. 

I tell him to download Tinder and log in. He does so. I look at the profile, the name has his middle name, but the profile picture doesn't have a face. It's a wall and a curtain, but it's our curtain. I recognize it as our house. After some yelling and telling him I'm not stupid, he admits that it was indeed him who bought all the subscriptions, downloaded the apps, but not for the reason I was expecting. 

He admitted to me that he was using them to jack off. He was looking at girls in our city so that it felt real, just because porn felt fake to him. Now, full disclosure, I don't really have anything against porn or fantasies. We talked about it early in our relationship our definitions of cheating, especially because he had been cheated on before. It felt important at the time. I asked him why not just go to porn sites, why dating apps? 

His reasoning doesn't give me much answer, other than that he wanted it to feel real. I'll admit, he has a much higher sex drive than me. He asks for sex daily, but I'm happy with once or twice a week. I am a victim of sexual assault, multiple times, which we have talked about, so he understands that its hard me to come around. We have wonderful sexual chemistry, its just i have a hump with getting started as its really nervewracking for me. 

He claimed that even though he was lokking at girls, he wasnt messaging anyone. I asked him to show me, and he was readily happy to show me.  

What he said was right...after multiple scroll throughs of each app, making him re-download, log in, I'd take the phone and look through. There were no messages, all profiles were never fully made either. Most of them just had the name, age, and that's it. No likes, no bio...if he was looking to talk to girls id imagine he woukd put more effort than that. After that, I kicked him out just to give me some time to think. 

After that time, I confronted him more. He has a habit of sometimes turning off his location and claiming that his phone turns it off automatically when it goes into battery saving mode. I've never had an iPhone in my life so please don't judge me, I didn't know, but I was always skeptical. I asked him where he was really going, and he admitted that he had been going to a drug dealers house to buy cheaper weed. He is a stoner, I'm an average partaker. But I've expressed to him that im deeply uncomfortable with how often he smokes, and that I want him to stop one day, which is why he hid it from me. 

Now, onto the advice part. I don't know what to feel or think. I'm empty. A part of me thinks maybe he is actually cheating. I didn't let him go down easy, and I told him that despite seeing that there are no messages, and having fully gone through his phone, that I still don't trust him. I told him that I don't know how we could repair this, because right now the trust is gone. I don't care about what he does to masturbate, but the fact that he lied really rattled me. It makes me think that maybe there is more. He asked me if there was anything he could do and well...I told him that if he really wasn't cheating, then maybe he wouldn't have a problem admitting this to his dad, and his friends, both of which I've grown really close to over the years. His dad thinks very highly of our relationship, but I don't know, it was the best I could think of. As of now, he says that he will do it as soon as possible. 

So...reddit....any tips? Is it okay to feel rattled? Maybe he isn't cheating? I feel like what he unloaded was huge, I just wish he never lied. The fact that he lied leaves me with many questions. Please help. Thank you

Edit: just to add, and again reiterate. I also watch porn, quite frequently. Like I stated before, we both don't really consider it cheating. Porn can be really fun, and we're both very promiscuous people with normally, good communication. This situation is just throwing me for a loop. For people saying that he shouldn't be looking at porn in the first place, please keep this in mind, although I do appreciate the kindness.","I don't know if my (F23) boyfriend (M25) cheated and it's killing me..

He starts to claim that he's never seen this before and maybe his email was hacked. Okay...but if his email is hacked why is the app store on his phone also showing that he downloaded the app and subscribed? An added detail is all that subscriptions say that he had ended/canceled them a few months ago. 

I tell him to download Tinder and log in. He does so. I look at the profile, the name has his middle name, but the profile picture doesn't have a face. It's a wall and a curtain, but it's our curtain. I recognize it as our house. After some yelling and telling him I'm not stupid, he admits that it was indeed him who bought all the subscriptions, downloaded the apps, but not for the reason I was expecting. 

He admitted to me that he was using them to jack off. He was looking at girls in our city so that it felt real, just because porn felt fake to him. Now, full disclosure, I don't really have anything against porn or fantasies. We talked about it early in our relationship our definitions of cheating, especially because he had been cheated on before. It felt important at the time. I asked him why not just go to porn sites, why dating apps? 

His reasoning doesn't give me much answer, other than that he wanted it to feel real. I'll admit, he has a much higher sex drive than me. He asks for sex daily, but I'm happy with once or twice a week. I am a victim of sexual assault, multiple times, which we have talked about, so he understands that its hard me to come around. We have wonderful sexual chemistry, its just i have a hump with getting started as its really nervewracking for me. 

He claimed that even though he was lokking at girls, he wasnt messaging anyone. I asked him to show me, and he was readily happy to show me.  

What he said was right...after multiple scroll throughs of each app, making him re-download, log in, I'd take the phone and look through. There were no messages, all profiles were never fully made either. Most of them just had the name, age, and that's it. No likes, no bio...if he was looking to talk to girls id imagine he woukd put more effort than that. After that, I kicked him out just to give me some time to think. 

After that time, I confronted him more. He has a habit of sometimes turning off his location and claiming that his phone turns it off automatically when it goes into battery saving mode. I've never had an iPhone in my life so please don't judge me, I didn't know, but I was always skeptical. I asked him where he was really going, and he admitted that he had been going to a drug dealers house to buy cheaper weed. He is a stoner, I'm an average partaker. But I've expressed to him that im deeply uncomfortable with how often he smokes, and that I want him to stop one day, which is why he hid it from me. 

Now, onto the advice part. I don't know what to feel or think. I'm empty. A part of me thinks maybe he is actually cheating. I didn't let him go down easy, and I told him that despite seeing that there are no messages, and having fully gone through his phone, that I still don't trust him. I told him that I don't know how we could repair this, because right now the trust is gone. I don't care about what he does to masturbate, but the fact that he lied really rattled me. It makes me think that maybe there is more. He asked me if there was anything he could do and well...I told him that if he really wasn't cheating, then maybe he wouldn't have a problem admitting this to his dad, and his friends, both of which I've grown really close to over the years. His dad thinks very highly of our relationship, but I don't know, it was the best I could think of. As of now, he says that he will do it as soon as possible. 

So...reddit....any tips? Is it okay to feel rattled? Maybe he isn't cheating? I feel like what he unloaded was huge, I just wish he never lied. The fact that he lied leaves me with many questions. Please help. Thank you

Edit: just to add, and again reiterate. I also watch porn, quite frequently. Like I stated before, we both don't really consider it cheating. Porn can be really fun, and we're both very promiscuous people with normally, good communication. This situation is just throwing me for a loop. For people saying that he shouldn't be looking at porn in the first place, please keep this in mind, although I do appreciate the kindness.",1,7,2025-01-06 15:50,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1hv23bq/i_dont_know_if_my_f23_boyfriend_m25_cheated_and/,Neutral
18450,1htzpzs,post,I was accused of rape and cannot forgive myself - it’s ruining my life ,"*trigger alert* 

this is going to be a long one. Buckle up. 

My (F/40) once very close friend (M/36) that we will call “Brandon” completely destroyed my self image and made me believe I am a horrible person to my core. So much that I hide away from my once impressive social scene and cut myself off from the world and friends basically. 

Brandon and I spent every waking moment today. We were coworkers and clicked immediately upon meeting. Both spiritual, goofy, hard working, extremely sensitive, lonely, etc. I hosted a dinner party one night and he stayed after everyone left, until around 2am, smoking cigarettes and talking about very deep topics and life experiences as we discovered we were both Pisces and hate small talk. It felt like there was slight sexual energy but nothing happened, I didn’t think of it again. 

Then he came around almost daily after work (I lived by the office). Sometimes he came over before work. We went to lunch together. We texted every thought we had and emotionally grew very close, very quickly. I was starting to feel feelings but was so confused. He asked to stay the night a few weeks into this friendship, and slept on the couch. This happened often and suddenly he’s sleeping in my bed. Spooning me. Love bombs me and makes me feel like I’m seen and heard and loved for the first time. I feel safe and his presence calls my nervous system. I’m really feeling feelings now - but he has still never made a move. What the hell?

Eventually, my ex bf was randomly in town and we got together as friends (this wasn’t uncommon and we were close friends first) for dinner or coffee to catch up. I tell him the situation and he tells me this guy sounds like he needs something from me. I hear it but I second guess it since there could be some bias there. Brandon texts me 54 times “excuse me?!” while at this dinner. This is his childlike way of saying he needs attention but I read this as jealousy. 

A week or so goes by and I tell Brandon how I feel about him and I’m confused about what’s going on with us. He tells me he loves me as a friend but isn’t into me romantically, so I tell him I need space. I go on a vacation a few days later and he goes on a date that same weekend, which he tells me about in advance. She stays the night and they hook up, but he isn’t into her and asks if he can pick me up at the airport and hang out tonight. He tells me he’s not into her and would have rather hung out with me, then stays over and spoons me. 

During this time, I have started to become friendly with his sister and she’s asking me what’s up with us and why we aren’t together. I tell her that I told Brandon and he said he wasn’t into me. She tells me that he said to her that we were just friends, and she tells me everyone in their family thinks he’s in love with me and afraid to ruin our friendship by fucking it up. 


Additionally and tragically, I was kidnapped and raped around this time. Brandon became my support system immediately following and as I spent months begging the police to prosecute. My parents are across the country and couldn’t see how rapidly my mental health was declining, but they were grateful that I had Brandon to be there with me all the time. 

We go back to the same codependent relationship for about a year. I had never had such a best friend but I was sinking deeper into shock/depression and just wanted him to love me. 

About a year and a few months of this insane relationship, I begin to feel him pulling away. I feel that I am losing him and decide I’m going to make a move - because “he is in love with me and afraid to admit it so I must be the assertive one” like his sister and I had discussed multiple times. 

After his pulling away, I give distance and he comes back around and he wants us to plan a weekend trip to a neighboring beach town. We go for a weekend and begin the trip with drinks at the hotel. Then to a vineyard to wine taste. Then to dinner with more drinks. I have the liquid courage to make a move. 

We get back to the hotel room and (this is so hard to say and I hate myself for this part) and I lean into kiss him. He pauses but he doesn’t move away and says “no no, we can’t do this”. I read it as “we shouldn’t but let’s do it anyway” and began unzipping his pants to discover he is hard. I begin to give him head and he doesn’t fight me, he moans and finishes, the pulls up his underwear and go to the bathroom. Things are immediately weird next moment. We’re both drunk so I pass out. 

On our drive home the next morning, we get breakfast and hit a few shops- he says “wow that was really aggressive last night” “if it were anyone else I would have been afraid, but all good” “to be honest, it was incredible”. I am horrified but confused. I begin to understand what he is saying and cannot believe what I am hearing- “I thought he wanted it? He’s in love with me and everyone knows it. He was hard, he came, he was just playing hard to get. Why does he care when I’m on dates if he isn’t in love with me? Why did he just say it was good?”

We go back home and a day later he calls me to say “you sexually assaulted me”. I am so horrified- how could I do this to someone after what I just went through? I never meant to hurt him and I never viewed myself as forceful so I didn’t mean to, but, “he said no and I kept going- omg I am a rapist” comes to mind. And I never, ever, ever, let go of it.  The good person I thought I was has been destroyed and I am a rapist- the lowest of the low. We cut ties and I am devastated. How did I misread this when he clearly didn’t want to?

I finally get into therapy to help with this deep dark depression and I never tell her anything about that night, instead I unpack my own rape trauma. In these sessions we discover I am bipolar, and the antidepressants I’d been put on caused me to become incredibly manic and delusional. In hindsight, I had been manic and delusional for months before this happened. 

A few years later, he reached out to me and asked to get together. We had drinks and both apologized for our part in everything. He admits he led me on, unintentionally, and kept coming back because I made him feel loved. I tell him about my diagnosis and how I can see how delusional I was, now that I am medicated and clear headed. I tell him that I never meant to sexually assault him and how I cannot forgive myself. He tells me I need to release myself because he led me on and he let that blowjob happen. 

We went our separate ways after that. I feel he did me a favor to forgive me and let me forgive Myself, but still views it as rape. I learned that rape is not black and white. Regardless of my intention or reasoning, if he views it as unwanted, it is rape regardless. I then know that since be was raped, I have caused him deep trauma. I would give my life to undo that night. I never meant to hurt the person that I was the closest to, in the same way that I was trying to heal from. 

I’ve lived with this since 2020, and I’ve never told a soul. I can’t say it aloud. You’re the first to know. 

In every aspect of my life, this has affected me. My self image has never been worse, I constantly question who I am inside and if I am good or bad, and how I could be so stupid? In terms of relationships, I’ve not let myself date or get close to a man since. I isolate. I spend my life trying to make amends to the universe. I am unable to forgive myself. Regardless of what I thought was happening at the time due to my mania or mixed signals, he did not consent. I committed an unspeakable act. 

If you’ve made it this far, thank you. I wasn’t even sure if I would post it but the thoughts were flowing as soon as I started typing and it’s the first time I’ve vocalized it at all, so maybe even this will help me heal. 

Above all of my major traumas, this is the one that has caused the most damage to my life and self esteem. 

I’m open to any thoughts you might have. How do I forgive myself, stop self sabotaging, and move forward?","I was accused of rape and cannot forgive myself - it’s ruining my life  *trigger alert*

I had this thought as it was happening that I was going to return to the same state of nothingness that I was at. It was incredibly strange but I felt a sort of panic; it was strange.

I thought I wanted death, maybe I don’t. Maybe the primitive nature inside of me doesn’t - is there a difference between that and me?

18453,1hstqb8,post,Coparenting has ruined my life ,"I left my extremely abusive marriage about 2 years ago now. We have 50/50 custody of our 2 kids and it has been a nightmare since the beginning. 

Ex would break into my home in the middle of the night and trash the place, steal my stuff, and terrorize me. He would sit outside my apartment and wait for me to leave so he could “talk to me” and then berate me or try and manipulate me into taking him back. He often included the children in some of these interactions, and then blame me for exposing them to violence and abuse. 

When I moved on from him and got into a new relationship the erratic behavior just got worse. He broke into my home with the kids and assaulted me and my current partner and refused to leave. It got to the point I was given an emergency custody order which gave me full custody of the kids. In the time I had to quit my job, and leave my home to stay safe from Ex. Then began an 18 month custody battle, and we eventually got placed on 50/50 because Ex promised the court to do therapy and only communicate with me through a 3rd party app. I was devastated. 

Ex is gonna be the parent he’s gonna be, but it’s slowly affecting my day to day life. He tells the kids to call me and my partner awful names, and he tells the kids that I’m a “disgusting cheater” because I left him and moved on with my current partner (I didn’t meet my partner till 6 months after the divorce). He’s told the kids to feed our dogs “lots and lots of chocolate until they choke” and has told them that I am the reason the “bad guys came and took him away”, meaning when he got arrested for assaulting me that was my fault. 

My kids (3&5) have come home and called me the c word, they’ve called my partner a sexual slur amongst so many other awful things that kids that young should never know. They’ve told me they hate me, and that I ruined their life because they can’t see their dad. They told me I deserve to die, and so does my partner. We also have a newborn, and their dad has told them to hate the baby and to step on the baby. They’ve told me they wish “baby would die because shes stupid”. I know they’re parroting things their dad and his family is saying, but when that’s what I hear from my kids consistently during my time with them it just wears on me. 

I’m trying to keep my household as safe and consistent for my kids as possible. I know I can only control what I can control, but it’s breaking my heart that my kids are exposed to this. I feel it’s all my fault. I’ve brought up concerns about their mental and emotional wellbeing to Ex, but it’s such a high conflict relationship no matter what I say it’s deflected and somehow comes back to being my fault. I use the parallel parenting method and grey rocking when interacting with him but it hasn’t done anything to quell the barrage of insults and manipulative messages. 

I’ve tried so hard to build a healthy blended home and family, and for what? For the monster I divorced to still have their fingers in my life? For my efforts to move on and be a happier, healthier, better mother for my kids to be undermined at every turn? I fought and documented my abuse and did everything I was supposed to in court for them to just put me and my kids back in his hands? So what do I even do now? Should I have even left? 

I can’t live like this forever: it’s taken such a toll on my mental health, my relationship with my kids, with my partner, the kids relationship with my partner and my family; everything. It’s not fair to my kids or my current relationship. I left an abusive marriage to still be controlled and manipulated by it. There’s no escape and no hope, and I’m exhausted. I honestly don’t want to keep going, but if I quit then my kids have no one truly there for them.

I fought and documented my abuse and did everything I was supposed to in court for them to just put me and my kids back in his hands? So what do I even do now? Should I have even left? 

I can’t live like this forever: it’s taken such a toll on my mental health, my relationship with my kids, with my partner, the kids relationship with my partner and my family; everything. It’s not fair to my kids or my current relationship. I left an abusive marriage to still be controlled and manipulated by it. There’s no escape and no hope, and I’m exhausted. I honestly don’t want to keep going, but if I quit then my kids have no one truly there for them. I’m at a loss, and I’m just tired of losing",50,15,2025-01-03 18:47,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1hstqb8/coparenting_has_ruined_my_life/,Neutral

I feel as if others have it worse than I do, and I am just pretending that I don't have any real issues I am just fabricating it. I am sitting on my bed, which it is currently 6:32 PM, and I went to sleep at 9 AM after spending about 3 hours argumentatively talking to my mom and dad. We live in the Middle East, and my dad works 14 hours away from where we live, he has worked at this company for now 6 years; it doesn't feel real, but we are here now, we moved here in June 2024, and before that, we were in Africa, skeptical about being detailed on the countries but my dad started working in the middle east in 2019, and we stayed in Africa, we moved to the middle east a few months after he started working and lived there until 2021 moving back to Africa from the years 2021 till the last year 2024 now back in the Middle East. Hopefully, that wasn't too complicated to understand, but now that we are back here, everything has gone the opposite way it was meant to. Moving back was meant to be another fresh start, I had just gotten expelled for bringing cannabis-infused food onto school grounds, and during that period, I was consuming a lot of weed, drinking from time to time, sneaking out, expanding my experience with boys (sexually) all of that. Meanwhile, my relationship with my parents worsened, I have always had special anger and resentment for my parents, for years, I didn't like how they wanted to act normal now when all I can remember is how horrid they were to me, in my perspective, I had a devastating childhood (My parents say otherwise even though if we can look through my childhood in detail we would say otherwise- I know they are in denial as my mom has said so herself) because my earliest memory is my female cousin inserting her fingers in me and instructing me to do the same to her, I believe she was a teenager at this point as I specifically remember her commenting on how she is hairy down there and I wasn't, I remember how sexually curious I began to be after that, inserting a paintbrush because I guess it made sense to do that at the time? Kissing my friends, kissing random girls, and having an obsession with girls, I thought I was gay at some point, I then started shifting my focus away from girls and onto guys, kissing a bunch of guys, wanting that validation for guys, and last year I was drunk, and I let a girl go down on me, I hated it because it reminded me of how I felt when my cousin touched me, I had always told myself that it wasn't a big deal that she touched me because I liked sex anyways, but then I started questioning if I do like sex or it's just a trauma response, Am I being dramatic? Does it count as assault? I told my mom last year what happened, and yesterday we had an argument because school is about to open, but I am not prepared, this past school year has been terrible, I started in August, and I miss all my friends in Africa, and I haven't found it easy making my way around an American school, being in the 10th grade I knew it was a horrible idea to start all over again, I mean how could I? There was this big inside joke around black people and just these silly racist jokes that made me feel so out of place because I just came from a place where there were 95% black students, and now there's barely even 10 of them, and even if they were there was this divide between the black kids who degraded themselves and others to fit in with the nonblack students and the ones who were weird and envious towards me? It made it worse that it was a boarding school, and I felt so alone and misunderstood, I wanted to so desperately return to Africa to how things used to be, but then I remembered how terrible my experience ended up I mean, I was expelled !! Then it put me in a spiral because i felt like i didn't belong anywhere and even though my friends from Africa love me so much I felt like i was so bad and unlovable I had to be disowned by everyone, I mean mentally I have been doing so unwell, I attempted in the dorm and later i was admitted into a psychiatric unit for a week and i was put on 2 types of antidepressants, diagnosed with anxiety and severe depression, which i haven't fully told anyone everything, even when i opened up to my mom yesterday it wasn't everything, it was brief, even what i am typing here is brief, it drives me insane how my mom doesn't want to admit that our household is toxic, how her and her husband alone are toxic, she says she is still with him because of us but i believe because of us she should leave him, they are not the best, i mean it's a lot with them i don't even know where to start, my therapist said it's not normal for my mom to vent about her personal life and emotions and her marriage, i know a lot of what's wrong with them, when my mom found out about my dad sending money every month for 2 years to what i think is a side chick and what she says is an old friend of his and they built an emotional connection but it wasn't a deal breaker what ? then she would ask me things like, ""If your husband did this... would you leave him?"" and I would say YES because someone who loves you wouldn't put you through anything meant to harm you so harshly, then she said Yeah that's what I said to say? like why did it change why did you SETTLE, you sometimes say you wish you never married him, and then you say, ""But I still love him,"" then you talk about it so casually that he is not your soulmate because although he knows your love languages, he does care enough to meet them? now as your daughter i worry about you because you are so emotionally dependent on me and you deny it but you are, why do i feel relieved when dad comes home and you can have someone to talk to even though yall will argue i won't have to think about you begging me to sit with you even though i want to sit alone and ponder on my own life, my mom has said multiple times that she wanted me to be her best friend but if she really wanted to raise her mini best friend i think she would have approached it different, i mean you stopped hitting me last year and you dont think hitting your child is abuse, she grew up in an abusive household so of course she thinks beating your child is normal, we are a christian household and she will always say the bible says to hit your kids but i read the same bible and believe in the same God yet i wouldn't dare lay a hand on my kids because it explains why that's the only thing i remember about her, i am still angry at when my DAD hit me with a belt while i was in the shower, you know how painful it is to be hit while wet ? because they found porn on their 11-year-old daughter's phone, but instead of hitting me, why didn't they sit me down and ask me what this was? why can't they just be gentle, why do they have to be so harsh? I didn't ask to be brought here, yet I am meant to understand why they raised me the way they did because ""it's their first time raising a teenage girl"" Well, it's MY first time living, and it's been SHIT what about that? why don't we care about that more ?? Now I have to figure out how to reach out to a home or orphanage of some sorry because they told me that no relatives would take me in and they don't want me in the house, and they don't think I should be here anyway seeing how I say this household is toxic, so now I have been deregistered from the high school boarding I was in and have to see if I can get any help to be accepted in a home of some sort? Idk. They do not understand why I said I don't feel mentally fit to return to school, they do not understand anything, they keep saying, ""We are not invalidating you,"" but they just don't get it, and I need to stop trying to make them understand because I don't think they will get it, they don't think I have severe depression and anxiety at least my mom thinks it mainly because I am not praying enough and I am allowing the demons to take over me, which that exhausts me to think about because I am a follower of Christ myself but I don't believe that okay? I mean, I do not even know what to say furthermore, now I need to find out if I can get any help so that they can send me back to Africa, and I trust my life will turn out just fine... hopefully

18455,1hrsl6k,post,my brother is a dickhead!,"c he’s become worse with it being just my mom  and me. he has hurt all of us and at one point went to jail for hitting my mom. he also pushed me so hard once i was limping and had a knot on my hip for like 2 months. he also sexually assaulted me as a kid and asked me very sexual questions from being 9-15. we are now 19 and 24 and he moved back into the house w me and my mom and now my boyfriend. and it’s been horrible once again. he’s gotten into drinking everynight and if i even have a slight tone in my voice it becomes him screaming at me and stringing insults at me. 

the reason im writing this post tho is because it got bad on new year’s eve. i was already not talking to him but i was drunk and a bunch of us was in the kitchen/ living room drinking and having fun so i figured i couldn’t just ignore him. it started w us having a debate on me and my boyfriends decision to get married early this year since he found out about it. which was a accident but it was going decently well as he was mostly respecting my decision on the fact that i am going to do what i want and yada yada. but later that night it was just me him and my boyfriend. we was all very drunk. and my brother started on his usually rambles about everything. and now i can’t remember exactly was said but the gist was he shows every one else this super sweet kind side and everyone says he’s so sweet but our family says he’s a dick head.( which yk is what he shows us.)“ but then he was  like if you and u and * boyfriends name* sat down and but like wrote a paper on who i am * boyfriends name* would be closer “ and im like dude. *boyfriends name* sees you the same we do and doesn’t like you because he seen the way you treat me. and he freaked out over that. he went to the couch and basically threw of my dog off the couch because it was mine. promised to ruin any wedding i had. started  his string of insults but i walked away w my dog because i knew anything i said would have made it worse. but i heard him say “ i hope he leaves you and you get raped. ( which btw i got raped last april and he found out recently and freaked out when i wouldn’t tell him) 

so idk why im fully writing this out. ended up sobbing to my boyfriend later about it. since he’s said sum really bad shit to me but never like this.   my mom won’t kick him out because she’s terrified of him and the reason he moved in with us is because our grandma kicked him out so he’ll have no where to go. but i getting to the point again like when i was 12 and afraid hes gonna end up snapping and killing us all or raping me or sum. and i can’t wait until he moves out again and i never have to talk to him again. i don’t even know if he remembers saying that but he didn’t look at me any time i went into the kitchen yesterday but he did try and talk to my boyfriend. 

i’m sorry that this is just a big mumbled jumbled mess. but it’s been in my head and i just don’t know what to do anymore. i have a therapist appointment monday so i get
to talk to them soon. and my boyfriend has been letting me ramble whenever i need but it idk. it’s so fucked up. i was dating a guy literally on meth who use to beat me and even he never crossed those lines. he did sum fucked up shit to me when he was on/coming down off meth but never did he say anything close to that/ bringing up insecurities like my brother did. it’s crazy that the one that’s supposed to be my proctor  and love me can say this type of shit to me. 

so between him and my 42 year old brother being the way they are. i only have one brother. who’s dead. so that’s awesome. anywho. thanks for reading :)","my brother is a dickhead! so since i was about 6? and my brother was about 10 he’s had horrible anger issues. he’s also been tall and a bit bigger. and he stopped going to school about 13 because he would start throwing shit and just basically terrorizing my family so everyone stopped tryin and the school kinda just never followed up with us. since then his anger issues have gotten worse and worse.  and after my dad had a stroke and was basically mentally handicapped ( which he abused him too as my brother was the only one strong enough to help him to the bathroom) he’s become worse with it being just my mom  and me. he has hurt all of us and at one point went to jail for hitting my mom. he also pushed me so hard once i was limping and had a knot on my hip for like 2 months. he also sexually assaulted me as a kid and asked me very sexual questions from being 9-15. we are now 19 and 24 and he moved back into the house w me and my mom and now my boyfriend. and it’s been horrible once again. he’s gotten into drinking everynight and if i even have a slight tone in my voice it becomes him screaming at me and stringing insults at me.

18457,1hoxov3,post,i'm completely lost in college. ,"i feel like this is more of a confession to myself about how genuinely fucked this year all was. i got accepted into my dream school and I moved across the country to study in a city that i love. it's always been my dream to study here, I have always wanted to live in this city, but a month into me moving there, I got raped by a guy who I barely knew (a light crush that i had on a guy that I have met a week before) who just wouldn't take no for an answer (i said no 3 times during it as well as told him prior that i wasn't looking to hook up). I will admit that i was naive, and just really confused overall because I just didn't expect anything like that to happen especially because I was clear about what I wanted. I had been sexually assaulted in the past prior to this in my childhood and it always a fear of mine that it would happen again so I just tried to block it out. this resulted in me letting this guy essentially emotionally and physically abuse me for an entire semester in secret; he shamed me that I was bad at sex (I was a virgin before he raped me) and that I'm disgusting etc etc; also saying anti-misogynistic rhetoric as well as racialised insults to me. i don't know why i let him; i think in my head at the time i wanted to convince myself that we were just star crossed lovers or something deluded because it was more comforting than understanding that he just raped me for the sake of it. that man truly terrifies me but thankfully, he was an exchange student though. but because this happened in my first semester; between adjusting to being out of home and in a new city and apartment by myself, managing schoolwork and a job as well as getting abused, i feel like i almost lacked on the social side. i want to clarify that I do have a lot of close friends in college but not in comparison to my friends. I have a really close friend who i moved from home with to this city, who i love but has become just awfully covertly snarky about this situation. she has made sly comments that 'i don't have as many friends as she has'.  i'm not one to say I wasn't at fault for some of this - i definitely was to an extent that i could been more strongminded and left, but i think i just got so deflated. my worst fear happened and i tried to do everything to control it and i think i just want somewhat of the 'college experience'.  i don't actually usually let things bother me this much, but i just hate the view that she has of me of me being meek or weird because of this. i feel like i have destroyed any opportunity of being 'normal'. it's only my first year and i'm 18 but idk i just can't stop beating myself up about it; like who lets that happen to them just days after their 18th birthday?

it's hard to admit to myself that i'm essentially having a fun but fucked time at university. it has been 6 months and i'm in therapy and healing but i just feel guilty in the sense of that i'll never be a normal university student again.

i just wanted things to be taken slow after the incident and he ended the situation because there was no sex. all he wanted was to have sex outside to which i said no to, he was nice to me and i thought everything was thing but he ended the situation because he got confirmation in the catholic church. He said for me to wait for him and i did, he doesn’t like me romantically :(

i feel horrible for not having sex with Max and just can’t forgive myself for not doing it. I apologise if this doesn’t make any sense

18459,1hnqi3p,post,I have to loose 30KG (66 pounds) but I'm so scared of being thin,"I used to be skinny, then normal weight and gradually became curved. After having my kids, I lost the extra weight. I looked great! 

But then I fell into an incredibly deep hole of burn out, anxiety and depression. I didn't think I would survive 2019. Thanks to a great therapist and support system, I worked through my issues. But I did gain so much weight. I'm so unhealthy and this NEEDS to change. I'm scared that I'll die and won't be able to see my kids grow up. 

But at the same time, I'm scared to be thin and become a sexual object for people to abuse. Being fat is safe in that way. Last time I lost the weight, I was assaulted at work. I've been sexually harrased so many times in my life, even dating back to when I was a young girl. The last few years have been so peacefully in that regard. Being fat is like being invisible and I feel so much more safe. But offcourse it's not worth losing my health or life over. It's just very conflicting.

18461,1hnby8k,post,This guy still tries to hook up with me after I expressed how much I hate him,"I had a on and off thing with a guy for 6 years. He randomly messages me every once in a while asking to hook up. More recently he moved across the country for school so he messaged me on holidays when he is back home. 

I met him when I was 18 and he was 20. We are now 24 and 26. He was my first kiss I lost my virginity to him. I admit I had a lot of issues letting go of this and realizing he was only interested in sex. After years of being mistreated there were so many instances when I should have ended things. I had nothing to compare it to, my parents also have a toxic relationship so I just thought these things were normal. I grew up being taught that you should just be passive and accept problematic behaviours to not cause conflict. For example: 

- He “forgot” condoms one day so I agreed to have sex without.
- I drove 30 mins to his neighbourhood. We were parked nearby and hooking up in my car. But I left my keys in the ignition too long killing the battery. He said his parents needed him to come home so he just walked home and left me there with a dead car. I had to call my sister to jumpstart the car
- He was in a brief relationship with someone and would still reply to my insta stories and message me while dating another girl. 
- He pressured me to sneak him into my room in the middle of the night. My mom found out and made my life hell for the next couple months. I had told him no many times and he kept pushing it telling me it would be “hot”. I should have known better that’s on me, but it also would have been nice if he didn’t keep harassing me about it. 
- He pressured me to sneak out at 3am and go to his place. I saw drugs on his bedside table, he was clearly on drugs and did not disclose this to me before I arrived. Something about his behaviour was just off to me and it made me uncomfortable. He put his whole hand over my face and kept telling me to shh. I started crying during sex and he didn’t seem to notice. 
- He was on his phone while we were in missionary. (He was holding his phone over my head so I couldn’t see what he was doing)
- He “accidentally” put it in the wrong hole and I started crying in pain. 

There was one big incident that happened last year, this was the last straw that finally shook me out of this cycle. I got super drunk with a friend and he kept messaging me telling me to come over. I told him I was drunk and he said “good”. I took an uber there. I went to use his bathroom and saw he was growing weed in his bathroom… weird I felt uncomfy. He started hooking up but I was very very drunk. I had also been sexually assaulted earlier that year and hadn’t had sex since then. The details of this are fuzzy to me, I don’t really know what happened but I suddenly felt like I was flashing back to the assault. I felt so confused. I didn’t feel like I was in my body. I asked out loud “what is happening where am I?”. That seemed to freak him out. He put my clothes back on. He grabbed my phone I think he opened it with my Face ID? He booked an uber and basically dragged me out of his house. While in the uber I realized I forgot my glasses. 

I have a very poor prescription I cannot see much without my glasses and as a result they are very expensive. They were $600. Obviously I wanted them back. I called him but he didn’t pick up. In the morning I saw that he blocked me. I tried messaging on other social media over the next couple days, but he kept blocking me. I was so angry, I wasn’t simply asking for my glasses back but also ranting and yelling about how much pain he has caused me. I told him he’s a horrible person and I hope bad things happen to him. I threatened violence. Eventually I made a fake number and reached out explaining how expensive the glasses are and if he doesn’t give them back I would regard this as theft. He finally messaged back saying he left for school but could  arrange to have them left outside his house for me to pick up. There was no apology. 

After this interaction he messaged me a few months later “apologizing” and saying he’s back in town asking to hook up. I went off on him and blocked him. I blocked him on insta and snap and phone number

A few months later now he reaches out again! I forgot to block him on Facebook. So he reached out on there this time. Once again I blocked him. 

I’m not really asking for asking for advice. I’m just extremely angry. I do not understand how he thinks it is acceptable to reach out to me. I received no real apology for any of this. Every time he reaches out it is so extremely triggering. I have blocked him on everything but I’m worried he’s going to make a fake number to contact me in the future. Not sure what I can do about that. I can’t take this anymore. ","This guy still tries to hook up with me after I expressed how much I hate him I had a on and off thing with a guy for 6 years.

For more context I’m 24, I live with a roommate, I have a full time job and support myself and my dog. I’ve always known I’m kinda average in terms of looks and don’t really get much attention from women. I had a 4 year relationship from 18-22 and it really messed me up. My ex would actively bully or manipulate me into sex and it wasn’t until I broke up with her and told my therapist that I learned that was more or less sexual assault. It’s taken me 2 years now to even feel like I could trust another partner. Now that the background is over let me explain why I don’t think I’ll ever date again. I matched with someone on bumble and after about a week of messaging back and forth I realized I just cannot do dating apps anymore, it just isn’t for me. So right there goes a lot of chances to potentially date again. The other issues are that I don’t have any hobbies that take me out of the house. I enjoy books, movies, and video games. I spend most of my time on my couch with my dog. I don’t particularly like going out drinking so I’m not meeting people at bars, in fact the only places I really go are work or my friend’s houses. Work is just about the only place I meet people and I don’t particularly want to go down the path of dating a coworker. Just like that there aren’t any other options for me to date without me changing something about myself, and I just don’t want to do that. I like my routine. I wake up, walk my dog, go to work, come home, walk the dog again, make food, watch or read something, walk the dog again, and go to bed to repeat the process. On paper it sounds miserable but honestly I kinda like it, it just came with the realization that I likely won’t ever find another partner unless some act of god sends someone my way. At the end of the day though I’m happy, I have a wonderful dog, a job I love, hobbies that I enjoy, and friends who I care deeply about, life is good. It’s been a weird feeling to come to terms with and I don’t know how people would take me being open about this, especially my mom who probably wants some grandkids from me.

last year i got sexually assaulted by my ex (mtf) and things haven’t gotten better. it has drained me telling the police but i have spoken on that a lot recently. i’m exhausted of it all, my ex took advantage of me and she was abusive to me (mentally, emotionally and sexually)

i’m trying to keep this as short as possible and in no contact with my ex, i hate her

i didn’t know it was abuse until my ex accused me of it and researched and it all relates to her. i’m angry that i was forgiving and got treated horribly and as a body again . as for her boyfriend a lot nicer that me and actually bothers with him and i tried to move on but it made me feel exhausted 

the assault happened, when i was in a situation with someone else and i blame myself for being violated. all because i spoke to my ex again thought she cared about me and checked up on me this time last year. 

i felt so disgusted after being violated and explaining to the guy i had a situation with, it affected it so so badly 

for the past week especially even this time of year , i have been having panic attacks and nightmares reliving it, it scares me more and more everyday and i don’t have a support system at all. the thing that gets me angry is being alone dealing with it whilst my ex (who didn’t take accountability for violating me) is there with a boyfriend (who she cheated on with me, but that’s another thing for another day and who didn’t really care)

i’m just sick of it all and feel powerless because the police didn’t help me and i hate speaking to people about it, it’s tiring and it’s my post history. the police invalidated me and don’t have real life support system , why do i have to suffer 

i have tried therapy and that’s draining itself. just can’t wait to get back to drugs and drinking it all out. i don’t recommend substances as a coping mechanism, that’s the only thing i got is substances 

i just want to suck all of my emotions up and get over it, but i need someone to like me to forget it all. i feel so alone i might attempt suicide tonight,","i hate this time of year i hate living in this nightmare reality where i have to suffer. i feel alone, i’m beyond exhausted of this nightmare

18467,1hketgz,post,I'll never really know if he did it on purpose,"This is something that's been weighing on me for years. Sexual assault trigger warning.

When I was 20, I started seeing a guy who was more experienced than me. I had never had sex with a guy and had only ever done kind of mild foreplay. 

We were in bed together one night, I was on top of him and we were kissing and then I thought he started fingering me. It didn't feel like it usually did and was even slightly uncomfortable but I thought it was just because of the angle he was fingering me from. I didn't think too much about it until I stood up and saw that I was bleeding. I told him it must have been from the angle he was fingering me from, that maybe he had gone further in than he had before. 

He told me he hadn't been fingering me. I was confused and he said his dick must have slipped inside me, but everything was ""so wet"" that he didn't realize what happened until I started bleeding. Even as I'm typing this, I feel fucking stupid because this sounds absurd to put into words!!!

I was freaked out and was worried about getting pregnant from precum, as I was having some complications with birth control back then. He told me that couldn't happen and luckily it didn't.

My relationship with him ended up carrying on for years afterwards and he was regularly insanely cruel to me. It's still hard for me to call him abusive, but that's really the only way to describe it. 

It took me a long time to realize that maybe what he had told me that night wasn't true. I had no idea what having something bigger than a finger in me would feel like. I still don't even know for sure if it's possible for a man to not realize his dick is inside of someone who has never had sex before because she's so wet. And several times over the years, he had mentioned being into bareback sex. 

This isn't really something I've ever wanted to ask anyone to weigh in on before, if it's possible that he knew exactly what he was doing and that there's no way he didn't feel it. I don't think there's really a sub where I can post something like this and flat out ask people to weigh in on it and it would probably not be a great idea to do that anyway. But it might also help give me some clarity if anyone who has read this far wants to weigh on. I don't know. Thanks for listening. ","I'll never really know if he did it on purpose This is something that's been weighing on me for years. Sexual assault trigger warning.

When I was 20, I started seeing a guy who was more experienced than me. I had never had sex with a guy and had only ever done kind of mild foreplay. 

We were in bed together one night, I was on top of him and we were kissing and then I thought he started fingering me. It didn't feel like it usually did and was even slightly uncomfortable but I thought it was just because of the angle he was fingering me from. I didn't think too much about it until I stood up and saw that I was bleeding. I told him it must have been from the angle he was fingering me from, that maybe he had gone further in than he had before.

18468,1hjvmre,post,I can't believe I feel powerless as an adult being bullied by teenagers,"Last night, I was disrespected and humiliated by a group of 13-14 y/o boys who called me a number of racist slurs, accused me and my partner of sexual assault and theft, and fucking laughed at our faces because they know damn well we cannot do anything about it given that we're immigrants and they have wealthy parents who don't give a damn about their children's behavior.

This affected me to the point of having the first anxiety attack in 8 years. Things had been upsetting with them for about 3 months (we have to see their little asshole faces because of the job that lets us stay here legally so we can't escape them), but last night was worse, they really wanted to fuck us up and fuck they really did.

I woke up today and wanted to end it out of the immense helplessness I'm experiencing right now. Nothing had triggered my depression like this in such a long time and I feel so fucking embarrassed to admit that my last straw will be racist kids half my age.

18469,1hjuo8i,post,I lost my virginity last night and I’m so depressed,"F22. Just needed someone to tell because I don’t have anyone to talk to right now. I’ve been in this situationship with a guy (M29) from work for about a month now. We’ll call him D. I’ve only ever been with one other guy before two years ago and he sexually assaulted me. So, I was a little hesitant to do stuff with D. 

Last night D and I had sex for the first time. I was a virgin and I told him that. It was really weird and kind of overwhelming. I didn’t cry surprisingly. I spent all day today over at his place. I’m finishing my college program in 10 days and moving back home a couple states away the first week in January. I’m not sure if I’ll ever see D again. I’d like to move back down to where I am now for college in May. 

Anyways, I guess I should have saved myself for whenever I get married. I grew up in an extremely religious household where sex is only supposed to take place in marriage. I’ve been deconstructing my faith for over a year now. I am not going to tell anyone back home about what happened because I know they will judge me. Only one of my friends knows that I’m not a Christian anymore. I’m so tired of putting up a fake face all the time about what I believe and who I am. But I need my family’s support so I have to keep pretending.

I realized this last week that my depression is getting really bad. I’ve struggled with my mental health my whole life. I’ve been doing really good the past couple of months. But I’ve come to realize I’m really sad. I feel like my life is changing so quickly and I can’t keep up. I struggle with accepting the fact that things keep changing and time keeps moving forward and things will never be the same. My parents are divorced and my best friend isn’t really talking to me. My sister won’t really talk to me either because she’s too busy hanging out with her friends. 

I’ve started struggling with suicidal thoughts over the past week which sucks. I’ve dealt with them since I’ve been in fifth or sixth grade. I wish I could be normal. I figured I should have sex at least once in my life even if he doesn’t really care about me. Whenever I move back home, I’m going to be working a shitty office job making $9 an hour and taking care of my alcoholic mother. My best friend is probably moving to NYC. And my dad won’t talk to me for more than 5 minutes every week. 

I’m having a hard time looking forward to the future and trying new things. Things seem so bleak right now. I am going to try and volunteer at the local homeless shelter in my free time. I think it will be good for me to do something out of my comfort zone and give back. I wish I had studied Spanish in college. It’s what I wanted to do, but instead I’m stuck with a B.S. in Psychology where I can’t get any jobs in that field. Ugh. I’m sitting in my apartment drinking and crying. I move back home in 10 days and I don’t want to go back. I’m afraid I’ll kill myself when I go back. Hopefully I won’t. There’s still a lot of things I’d like to do one day. 

I still want to study Spanish. I also want to go to Spain and France and Japan. And I’d like to have a real boyfriend or girlfriend. I want to have people in my life who care about me and act like it. I want to be happy and feel

18470,1hiz3qw,post,I cheated again and again ,"I (21F) was in a relationship with my ex (25M) for 2.5 years back at home. We were in a long distance relationship. Everything was going good in the start but later on I did not feel any sexual attraction towards him or anyone. I thought I'm asexual. But, I clearly had a high sex drive prior to this phase. 

This is when my nightmares started, I had been raped by a relative, multiple times in my childhood. Adding to this, I had been sexually assaulted by  different other men in my life. 

Because of these events, I developed high sex drive to cope. I used to do it atleast 3-4 times a day. But during our relationship, I suddenly stopped pleasuring myself for months. He was supportive but I did feel bad for him. 

During this time, I started writing again and I had a secret account where I used to post my stuff. There I started talking to a guy as a genuine friend talking about struggles and mental health. I never told this to my boyfriend though. 

Then I had to move for my college and that's when things went a little shaky and he did come to visit me but I couldn't have sex with him. Later I talked about taking a break. And I did that. 

I was still talking to that poetry guy though but I met few more people here and I did go out with other guys. We never talked about any ground rules for a break. I did sleep around with people I didn't even know. The poetry guy came to meet and i did sleep with him too. 

I struggle with issues of self worth and I don't feel my body is mine anymore so I don't really care who I have sex with. But, every time I do it. I regret it. 

My boyfriend then comes to meet me. I stayed with him but we did not have sex and I broke it off. I told him I don't want a relationship rn and he said he would wait for me. But, from my side I was clear I don't know about the future but right now I don't want a relationship. 

However I went out with other guys, but never been in a relationship with any of them. I never told him about these dates though.

Now he found out about everything and I know I have been a terrible person and I accept my faults. I do not blame anyone but myself. I just don't know what to do now? 

Yes I'm planning to take therapy and until then I won't get into any relationship for my own sake. Nightmares have started again even prior to him knowing about everything and I'm experiencing sleep paralysis with the sexual things too every other day. It is terrifying and exhausting.

My friends found out too and they haven't been talking to me and I know I deserve it. They shouldn't associate with someone like me but I'm just so alone these days. I started self harming again. I need to stop. But I can't stop punishing my self. ","I cheated again and again  I (21F) was in a relationship with my ex (25M) for 2.5 years back at home. We were in a long distance relationship.

I live in a small town and so I sort of know everybody I’m young and what have you. The issues started right away because when we go out to the local grocery people of all ages stop to tell me hello could be old people or kids who used to go to school with my sister and brother both (15 f)and 20m). This is the cause for many of our major arguments and huge fights because she is so convinced I’m some ladies man. I’m not. I literally had almost 0 interest in relationships or anything before her. We’ve been together 4 years and I have never once cheated on her. She made cut off all my friends both male and female and is slowly trying to isolate me from my family and uses what I have confided in her about my rocky past with my mum and da against me to try and get me to go no contact with them. They haven’t done anything major since I left their household over 7 years ago. It’s difficult for me to go to work because she is constantly fighting with me over my female co workers and has told me that even telling them to have a good night is sexual assault and I could be held liable and she’s just trying to protect me. When she unexpectedly pops in to visit me my anxiety is on edge because if someone who I am in charge of even comes near my desk to ask me something about current projects or upcoming deadlines she will wait until the are out of my office and begin accusing me of sleeping with them and having office banter with them in the break room. I’m a project manager at a tech company that is very lax in environment and it stresses me out. I’m not allowed to leave my house, clean my car, shower, go to bed, or even sleep any extra hours without her say so otherwise it will be her keeping me up until late hours, knowing my work load is insane, fighting with me about how so and so in this department was calling her names to the other workers and she overheard them talking about how I’m such a great manager and how good a friend I am. I have caught her lying about what these woman are saying in real time. 

As a result I live a complete double life. I go to a local sports bar behind her back every Saturday with another guy who works closest with me at the office. He Is really my only friend and if she ever knew I was close with him she would surely find some sort of rumor suddenly to make him out to be a bad guy and tell me that my intuition is none existent and she only has my best interest in mind and fight with me anytime she catches us having a chat or going round for a cheeky nando here and there. I shower secretly when she isn’t demanding I be on the webcam via zoom and clean my small house when I can. Sometimes I hope she fights with me bad enough she doesn’t want to see me and runs off to her moms so I can have a night of peace. 

She claims all of this my fault because I have lied in the past about talking to old mates from grade 2and seeing my family in the past and this hurt her deeply. I can’t explain why I lied about those things other than I just didn’t feel safe enough to. I don’t feel allowed to be human. I don’t feel as though she allows me to be who I really am. I feel like a rat in a cage. I feel so bad leaving her because deep down I feel like she is just a sad and lonely insecure person who has been hurt many times by people who didn’t care about her. I don’t know how much longer I can take it but the last time I tried to get a divorce she refused to sign the papers and she begged me for a full month straight for me to take her back didn’t matter if i blocked her on all socials or changed my number she still found a way to contact me until she ran into me at a bar one night while I was drunk and drove me home and somehow in a moment of weakness I took her back and she promised to work on everything. It’s only gotten worse. The new 18 year old intern we have at work is her main target right now. She absolutely hates her with a passion and we fight about this girl everyday because she has a reputation for being a bit of a slag. I don’t know what’s true and what’s not. I know that my relationship is purely that of work and she isn’t even on my project team I only have to work with her maybe once a week and see her maybe an hour any other day. 

I hope I find peace one day and I hope that I understand if this was my fault or not and I hope one day she lets me go or I get the bollocks to just leave and live my life.

18473,1hi1g4r,post,A six year secret.,"This has haunted me all year. Now that I finally know. Ive been married to my wife for 6 years, and we've been together for 8. Earlier this year, she explained to me some things that had happened to her. My wife had been in a long-term  relationship that ended badly after about 8 years before we started dating. Her ex was a jealous and controlling sort of guy. She had also had something akin to a rebound situationship months after that break up. This is important background information for the rest of the story. 

One day in March of 2018, a month or so before she asked me to marry her, she had an emotional breakdown. She sobbed helplessly and screamed. It seemed like she was in agony. Her mother had passed away recently, and she told me that her breakdown was because she was still processing that loss. 

Now we return to the near present. In April of this year, she finally told me everything. That day in March of 2018, 3 years after breaking up with her ex, he shows up while I'm at work. He had driven there drunk, and my wife, who was still my girlfriend at the time, had been drinking as well. Without going into too much detail, he made an aggressive sexual move on her, and she froze in shock and numbly went along with it. He then forced her to promise that she would never speak of it. Its important to note he was also with  someone else at the time. She didn't want any part of it. My wife has an issue with setting boundaries and people pleasing. She said that afterwards she panicked, vomited, and had an emotional breakdown. She said it was a side of him she had never seen, and probably the most traumatic thing she'd ever been through. The whole thing was so truamatic that she only remembers the event in disjointed flashbacks. After telling me this, even more came out. In the week before this incident, the guy who she had been in a situationship with attempted to sexually assault her. It turns out he also raped her the first night that we had had sex. And that wasn't the only incident with situationship guy. My wife has significant sexual trauma from childhood, and these men reopened that wound and gave her more. 

I was shocked and angry to finally see the truth of everything, 6 years afterwards. It explained some things about our relationship. I was outraged at those men. I was angry that I'd been lied to for 6 years. To my shame, I was also angry that she didn't stand up for our relationship. I know now that that is unfair, but I also can't deny the hurt I felt. I haven't fully accepted that this is a problem I can't resolve. I wish she would tell her ex off, but that isn't fair of me to ask either. 

I lost a friend trying to find support for this situation. He didn't want to hear it. I felt completely alone with everything that had happened.

 At first, I considered revenge. The person my wife's ex was with at the time was the person he ended up marrying. I confronted him about all of this, and he told several lies about the situation. Its clear that he never got over how things ended between him and my wife. He wanted to hurt her. That much became obvious. I threatened to tell his wife. I never did, mostly because my wife wants me to let it go. So now, I'm stuck trying to accept that this is an unsolvable problem, and the best path to happiness is to let it go. We've had a great relationship. Its hard because we both have mental health problems, but no one has ever known me better. I never imagined that her kindness would be twisted into the mental anguish that she suffered through. 

I cant lie, I wanted to name drop all of these people. I wouldnt be disappointed if one of the people that knows us put the whole story together from these bare details. It probably won't happen. Either way, I'll go to my grave hating those men. They are cowards, predators, and they shouldn't even be around women. Neither of them could face me, and they knew it, so they skulked around and pressured my wife while I was working. Let's just say that if it came down to a physical fight, I would leave nothing but an unrecognizable lump of flesh. They wouldn't stand a chance. I'm a large man, and I'm well armed. But that will never happen, and I shouldn't want it to. 

If you've read this far into my post, thank you. I've had no one to share this pain with besides the person who experienced it. Even if it is just a stranger on the internet, it's nice to feel less alone with everything that's happened. I can't see the world in the same light that I did before. 

M.S and M.D. if you ever read this, then know that it would be better for your health if I never laid eyes on you again. ","A six year secret. This has haunted me all year. Now that I finally know. Ive been married to my wife for 6 years, and we've been together for 8. Earlier this year, she explained to me some things that had happened to her. My wife had been in a long-term  relationship that ended badly after about 8 years before we started dating. Her ex was a jealous and controlling sort of guy. She had also had something akin to a rebound situationship months after that break up. This is important background information for the rest of the story. 

One day in March of 2018, a month or so before she asked me to marry her, she had an emotional breakdown. She sobbed helplessly and screamed. It seemed like she was in agony. Her mother had passed away recently, and she told me that her breakdown was because she was still processing that loss. 

Now we return to the near present. In April of this year, she finally told me everything. That day in March of 2018, 3 years after breaking up with her ex, he shows up while I'm at work. He had driven there drunk, and my wife, who was still my girlfriend at the time, had been drinking as well. Without going into too much detail, he made an aggressive sexual move on her, and she froze in shock and numbly went along with it. He then forced her to promise that she would never speak of it. Its important to note he was also with  someone else at the time. She didn't want any part of it. My wife has an issue with setting boundaries and people pleasing. She said that afterwards she panicked, vomited, and had an emotional breakdown. She said it was a side of him she had never seen, and probably the most traumatic thing she'd ever been through. The whole thing was so truamatic that she only remembers the event in disjointed flashbacks. After telling me this, even more came out. In the week before this incident, the guy who she had been in a situationship with attempted to sexually assault her. It turns out he also raped her the first night that we had had sex. And that wasn't the only incident with situationship guy. My wife has significant sexual trauma from childhood, and these men reopened that wound and gave her more. 

I was shocked and angry to finally see the truth of everything, 6 years afterwards. It explained some things about our relationship. I was outraged at those men. I was angry that I'd been lied to for 6 years. To my shame, I was also angry that she didn't stand up for our relationship. I know now that that is unfair, but I also can't deny the hurt I felt. I haven't fully accepted that this is a problem I can't resolve. I wish she would tell her ex off, but that isn't fair of me to ask either.

18474,1hhe1zy,post,What makes a good person? How do I stop seeing myself as a bad person? ,"Just for context, I know realistically that “bad” and “good” people don’t exist. And I am capable of seeing others as complex beings but not myself. I have OCD, a heavy component of which is moralizing obsessions. I have been treated for anxiety for a long time but I was diagnosed with OCD as an adult and I have never been actually tested for it. I’m trying to get back into therapy, but the waitlists are wild where I am. I just want some advice on how to not think so poorly of myself. 

I’ve always felt guilty about just about everything, I’ve always internally moralized things. But these past couple years have been super rough. I was going to start a PhD at school 1 after finishing my master’s, and was offered a summer research internship there before the program formally started. I was sexually assaulted by a person there and ended up asking the other programs I got into to reevaluate my application for unique circumstances. I was really lucky and one school did, and I went to school 2 to start my PhD. My first year and a half went really well, but then my advisor found out that I was working retail on the side and kicked me out of her research group. I couldn’t get any other professors at the school to take me so my only options were to leave or master out. I chose to leave because I already have a master’s in that subject. 

That was this past April. Then I went to a job as a research technician, but I didn’t get along at all with the PI so I found another job as an adjunct professor. Then today I’ve just learned that I won’t be given any classes next semester because of low enrollment. I am planning on hopefully going back to finish my PhD in a different but adjacent topic next year, but I haven’t heard back formally yet. I’ll have to find another job and I don’t have health insurance anymore. I’ve just felt like such a massive failure. I don’t have anything going for me outside my career, and I just feel like a major loser. 

I feel like I’ve failed in every aspect of life. 
- I failed to be the child my parents expected, I had serious mental and physical health problems. They also don’t seem very proud of me in any capacity 

- I’m not very good with money. I got into some decent credit card debt during my PhD, and I have made a lot of progress on my debt since I left, but not as much as I planned or could have because I buy BS that I don’t need just for the dopamine hit. I grew up super poor, but in a family that could have been lower middle class if my parents hadn’t been so bad with money. I’ve tried to drag myself out of that with education but I just haven’t made it. No employers want someone with a degree in physics

- I gained 150lbs in 4 months in my last year of high school on a medication. I’ve tried for YEARS to lose it. Last year I got bariatric surgery. I did lose 60 pounds with the surgery. But then it’s just kind of stopped even though I haven’t stopped trying. My Dr thinks that it was because I was taking depo provera. I did lose weight, but I’m still fat. So I failed at that 

- I quit my PhD and abandoned my dream of being an astrophysicist. A dream that I had worked toward exclusively for almost 9 years. I just left and threw it all away. I mean I know that I had to leave, I was essentially being kicked out. But academics has really only ever been the only thing I was good at or proud of. 

- I feel like I’ve failed at achieving the societal standards of womanhood. I mean for anyone else, I would say fuck societal standards. But it just feels bad to me. I’m not skinny, I’m not pretty or conventionally attractive in any way, I recently got electively sterilized. And I’m happy with my personal choice to not have children. But I just feel like I have nothing that people would respect from any direction. 

- I’ve had personality conflicts with people at several places. I think I have a really hard time keeping my mouth shut when I see things as unjust. I’ve also been places where I haven’t had personality conflicts, but I just feel like things are my fault when things go wrong because I’m the common denominator in those things going wrong. 

My problem is not just that I’m disappointed with myself, which I am. But I feel like a fundamentally bad person. I mean I don’t do crimes and I try to be nice to people. But I feel like there is something fundamentally bad about me. 

Are there others that also feel that way? I know that these feelings aren’t logical and that life is very fluid and complex. But how do I feel that instead of just intellectual recognizing it?

18475,1hh7fr1,post,"My life is so fucked, I don't think the only solution is to suffer until the end comes in however long. ","I don't even know where to begin, but this is going to be a long post. 

I guess it all started my insecure and malignant narcissist shit of a dad. When I was 15 I had a real shot of becoming a professional sailboat racer. I was told by many different coaches I was gifted, a couple of racing schools even tried to recruit me. Dad stepped in a stopped it dead. Because he thought the spotlight would shift to me and he couldn't stand that. 

When I was 15 I was accused of rape (my gf and I had sex, our first. She felt guilty and told her mom.) My dad wanted to leave me to rot in prison, didn't want to hear what I had to say. Mom convinced him to hear me out, but not until after I'd spent a few days in jail. It went all of the way to court, my lawyer broke her (my ex gf) on the stand. It came out that her mom knew how well off my dad was and she saw dollar signs, so they made the whole thing up. All charges were dismissed. 

Afterwards I was forbidden from dating, ever, not that I wanted to. I moved out at 17 and joined the US Marines to get away. I was a tank driver and did two tours, saw, was in combat, etc (not going down that path). First tour I was a driver, second tour I was a crew chief. After returning my second time I was sexually assaulted, but I managed to get away from the guy before anything really happened. Then a few months later I was raped by a guy who drugged me, reported it to my CO..... it went nowhere. But, I did get the gift of CPTSD. (More on this later)

After the military I got married. Then I got divorced, turns out she was cheating on me from day 1...... with my best friend at the time. His excuse was that she was hot and he couldn't help himself. She got everything except the clothes on my back, mostly because I was broke and couldn't afford a better lawyer. 

I moved back to my hometown (Pittsburgh) met a wonderful and supportive woman who wasn't fazed by my CPTSD. We dated for 3yrs, I proposed, she said yes, we started planning our wedding and future together. I thought my life was finally changing. But, we never got married. She broke it off when her parents refused to accept me into their family. She was Jewish, but didn't practice. However her parents were orthodox, we knew they were going to be a challenge. I was going to convert, we even contacted her parents rabbi. It didn't matter, they told her if she married me anyway she would lose her entire family. 

I lost my career to the Great Recession, then I got a surprising new one in the high end boutique retail industry, I still work in it.  

Next I met 3 women that I fell in love with. I moved for the 1st, she broke up with me 3weeks after I moved. She ended it because she couldn't live like a hermit anymore. I'm not comfortable in crowds or big cities from my CPTSD, so I didn't go with her to big events, concerts, and big cities. 

I moved again, fell in love again and dated her for almost 4 years. It ended because she said she wanted to ""live like a normal person"". Because of my struggles, I don't do things a lot of others do. Like I live with all of my blinds closed. 

The 3rd I broke up with after 2yrs because she was a diagnosed as a co-dependent and had lied about her entire life to get me to like her better. Also she would do anything to avoid conflict. After two years her facade finally fell down. 

Then came a bunch of women I dated for no more than 3 months. Most broke up with me because they ""couldn't deal with the compromises of dating a person like me"". This is when I learned that the only value I had as a partner was directly related to how good I was in bed. 

I decided I needed a break and did LOTS of traveling. I was attacked by muggers twice, thank goodness for military training, they were more hurt than me. 

Then I didn't care, I chased people who only wanted sex, fwb, fb's, clubs, house parties. Age, gender, sexual orientation, none of it mattered. I mean why would it? I'm not worth anything outside of sex. As dozens of people have told me dozens of times, I've got ""too many compromises"" to be seen as any kind of a serious partner. 

I do have a gf now, I love her to death. But, I'm terrified of when she's going to let me go. I'm doing everything I can to be the best guy she's ever had, but I know from experience it's just a matter of time before she ends it. 

I needed to get that off of my chest, it's my sad story of a fucked up life. I'm not going to harm myself, or others. As my Dad told me when I was 10, I'm ""just one of those people that most don't like very much.""

18476,1hgvsjr,post,"mom betrayed my trust, dont think i can forgive her","i had an arguement with my mom the other day and she did something i don’t think i can forgive. i don’t look at her the same. she asked me a question i didn’t like and i asked why she’s asking the question she started raising her voice and getting mad at me and throwing insults at me for the next few hours. we started going off topic about the thing we initially argued upon. we both said pretty insulting things, like she said she hopes i have a long lasting relationship, i brought up that she’s divorced. she said that i’m a b word, and i’m crazy, and i brought up some of the disgusting things she said about us or my siblings.

she cried about it many times, which i wasn’t trying to do, but because of what she said i don’t know if i even care anymore. here’s where it starts. when i 7 or 8 i found out about sex through the game gta 5. obviously that game isn’t suitable for kids that age. i also has 2 friends who were also into the game and we would talk about it. when i was 9 i took my sister who was 1 to a bed and i asked to put my dick in her mouth. she basically said no many times and i got up and left. i confided in my mom about this when i was 14, after i remembered what id done and had felt immense guilt, as well as suicidal feelings regarding it. she said she wouldn’t tell anybody because she knew that i didn’t know what i was doing. i didn’t understand the capacity of what i was doing and wouldn’t have done it if i did.

i didn’t know and understand what things like porn, sexual assault, sexual harassment or rape was. i was trying to recreate the things i’d seen in video games. this is the biggest regret of my life. it took a long time but i finally forgave myself for it. so back to the arguement, my mom brought up how my little sister doesn’t like me (which isn’t true) and i said how she’s always trying to be around me, or asking me for hugs or staying in my room. she said she shouldn’t come to my room because i might rape her and she brought up the incident i mentioned above. my younger brother was within earshot as well. they’re 11 and 13 so she didn’t understand what she was saying but king story short, she betrayed my trust and i don’t see her the same. i don’t even thinks she’s my mom anymore, and i don’t think it’s something i can look past or forgive. she came to apologize to me after because she knew how sensitive that topic was and how traumatic it was for me, even tho i didn’t gaf i still think she’s a piece of crap. she also went to tell my siblings that the thing had never happened, and she saw it in the news and it was someone else who looked like me. eventually they’re going to figure out and i can’t forgive her for that. for using such a sensitive topic like that against me. saying i’d rape my sister knowing i’d never do that. it’s been 2 days, i’m still angry about it and i don’t think i’ll ever move past it. she also alluded to the situation in an argument twice before. i’ll make sure to never tell her personal details about my life again, this is all making me feel suicidal again

i didn’t know and understand what things like porn, sexual assault, sexual harassment or rape was. i was trying to recreate the things i’d seen in video games. this is the biggest regret of my life. it took a long time but i finally forgave myself for it. so back to the arguement, my mom brought up how my little sister doesn’t like me (which isn’t true) and i said how she’s always trying to be around me, or asking me for hugs or staying in my room. she said she shouldn’t come to my room because i might rape her and she brought up the incident i mentioned above. my younger brother was within earshot as well. they’re 11 and 13 so she didn’t understand what she was saying but king story short, she betrayed my trust and i don’t see her the same. i don’t even thinks she’s my mom anymore, and i don’t think it’s something i can look past or forgive. she came to apologize to me after because she knew how sensitive that topic was and how traumatic it was for me, even tho i didn’t gaf i still think she’s a piece of crap. she also went to tell my siblings that the thing had never happened, and she saw it in the news and it was someone else who looked like me. eventually they’re going to figure out and i can’t forgive her for that. for using such a sensitive topic like that against me. saying i’d rape my sister knowing i’d never do that. it’s been 2 days, i’m still angry about it and i don’t think i’ll ever move past it. she also alluded to the situation in an argument twice before. i’ll make sure to never tell her personal details about my life again, this is all making me feel suicidal again

It was by my cousin's fiancé. We had a party at their place with other cousins, uncles and aunts, and their friends, we had a lot of drinks, mixing drinks and smoked some weed.
We went to bed, I crashed on the couch and for some reason my cousin's fiancé also crashed on the couch, it's an L-shaped couch. While the other cousins took the bedrooms. I was in and out of it, but I passed out. Then I woke up to him touching me down there. I fell asleep in a mini skirt and had pantyhose on. Then he started to take it off and finger me and touching me more. I was just so in and out of it to say anything. Then he starts to suck my boobs, and then eats me out. I think he also put my hand on his cock and put his cock in my mouth. I think he also fingered my butt and used his tongue. Again, I was in and out of consciousness from the drinking, I’m just replaying the night and all the details are coming now. I remember snapping out of it, telling him to not have sex with me and to put my underwear back on, which he did. But I don't remember anything after that. 

I'm a virgin or I guess was? But I don’t think there was any penetrative sex. I've never done anything sexual with anyone before, which makes me sad that that was how my first time went… But I've been feeling upset and feel horrible that it's my cousin's fiancé!!! But I didn't do anything wrong, I didn't initiate it!!!! I don’t want to feel blamed when it was his fault. But I don't know why I didn't have the energy or courage to tell him to stop. Like I should've said STOP. I don't know what's wrong with me. I can’t report this to anyone, just want to get it off my chest. I’m going to ignore it and forget it ever happened. But I also don't want to betray my cousin... they’ve been together for like 6 years. I didn't think this was how my first time for oral sex was gonna be. I just don't know what to do, but telling my cousin is not an option!!!!And I haven't talked to the fiancé since it happened. We woke and he acted normal like nothing happened. I'm not sure if he remembers what happened either because he was also drunk and high, which i know is no excuse. But I hope he doesn’t remember it either :/ ","I was assaulted by someone’s fiancé I was sexually assaulted

18481,1hfh2ew,post,The inconveniences that come with trauma. ,"
Trigger Warning: Sexual Assault


I'm drained. It's 3:19 since I began writing this, and l need to vent about the things I resent even more than my trauma itself.


1. Sleep deprivation: tonight, I woke up thinking his hands were pinning my throat down on the mattress again. I'm surviving on just three hours of sleep a day, and it's wearing me thin.


2. Cold sweats: Whenever I feel even a little on edge, I break out in cold sweat. It's like I've walked through a sprinkler in the middle of December. It’s freezing and unpleasant. 


3. Memory and cognitive decline??:
My mind feels sluggish. I used to excel academically, but now I struggle to process even a single paragraph. l've managed to lose the thousand-yard stare I once had (shout out to a guy who pointed out my eyes creeped him out). On the bright side, I no longer dissociate for weeks or months at a time. That's progress, I suppose.


4. Sensitivity to voices: I used to be patient, and could handle louder tones and faster conversations. Now, I flinch when someone calls my name or speaks too loudly. Even my boyfriend's excitement-his faster, louder speech-overwhelms me. He understands when I walk away or shut down, but it feels so rude, and I hate that I can't handle a mere conversation that isn’t monotone. 


Sometimes, my chest aches, my
lungs close up, and I'll stumble. For a moment, I'll wonder if my body has finally reached its limit, and I feel a fleeting sense of hope that it has. 

Then I get back up, disappointed-maybe even resentful in myself-that those thoughts were some kind of subconscious wishful thinking.


I know progress isn't linear etc etc etc. But I wonder how much longer my body can endure the constant anxiety and relentless sleep deprivation. And some days, I can't help but think maybe l'd be better off dead to escape these incessant little battles.

I was the oldest of the group being 29 at the time, with it going down to people between the ages of 26-20.
The bar hired a new starter, a girl of 18 who quickly joined this social group, we weren't particularly close but got on fairly well.

One day at work I found her alone in the staff room crying, I comforted her and she told me she had been sexually assaulted waiting for the train after work the night previous.
This also led to her saying she sadly experienced the same thing during her childhood regularly.
From here I tried to look after her, talk to her more and involve her in all activities as a group.

As time passed we grew very close, the bar closed down and the although the social group mainly went in different directions, we've always stayed in contact. We would message every day and FaceTime etc.
Our relationship became very Brother/Sister-esque and we have helped each other through a lot of hard times. She's absolutely one of my best friends nowadays.

The age gap and her being the opposite sex has never bothered me until recently.
For the record what we have is purely platonic, I'm heterosexual but I've never thought of her that way. I view her like a little sister.
She is also interested in Women. Being anything except friends is completely implausible.
We've often laughed about how people might perceive our friendship, but we both know the facts so don't care.

However in making new friends I often hesitate to tell them about her being one of my best friends, just because of that initial judgement or it being perceived as weird.
My current girlfriend has known her as long as I have and recently expressed concerns about her potentially being unsure of her sexuality, even though I know she's as lesbian as you can be. She has also questioned our relationship being platonic.
I do not like this but refuse to change anything about this friendship, I feel like my girlfriend can either accept it or go, I'm not throwing away a good friend for anybody.

I worry now about having a slew of girlfriends who don't like it / think it's weird and all just have to go until I meet one who accepts it for what it is.
I hate the age gap for this reason, I wish I could be younger or her older, or even just change gender.
Unfortunately I think being the older male who's friends with the younger female does bring a weird social stigma and I can understand it from a third person perspective.
Her siblings and parents absolutely love me, and my friends who know the situation are supportive.
I'm now just annoyed that this could be a reoccurring issue for me and had to rant. ","I hate the age gap between a friend and me. Earlier this year I (30, male) worked in a bar and developed a social group of workers who would go out after shift and occasionally play boards etc.

18483,1hf8115,post,"Man, trying to be helpful is such a waste of time, sometimes. ","Every now and then, I'll see someone on twitter or Bluesky or reddit or whatever who isn't doing so hot, and I try and see if adding my perspective is helpful. Sometimes it is, sometimes it isn't, but for now I am *compulsively* helpful because I have a trauma related need to be useful to other people, so it is what it is. 

Today, someone on a non-reddit platform that I'm on started talking about how people ignore their posts when they talk about depression, so I tried to offer my two cents. The frustrating thing is, they immediately got defensive and assumed that I was speaking from a place of privilege -- that my life is easier than theirs, that I have no idea what it's like to be in poverty or to feel ignored or to be at risk of homelessness. 

It's silly, because I don't know this guy, and I only responded to his post because nobody else was, and he was clearly feeling very isolated. I didn't go into detail about my life or my issues, because this wasn't about me. I ended up bailing on the conversation when he started lecturing me about what it's like to be at risk of homelessness; I've been homeless 3 times, and if I lose my housing right now then I'll be out on the street. 

It's not like my life has been easy. I've >!drowned, been sexually assaulted as a hate crime, spent 8 months as a teenager being catatonic, and have been the victim of harassment, discrimination, physical violence, and extreme and long term abuse.!< That's not even an exhaustive list. I don't really have family or friends that I can rely on, and I'm still struggling to get my mental health to a point where I can learn to drive and start trying to make friends. 

But, nah. I can't possibly understand this guy's life. Mine has clearly been too full of opportunity and good fortune. I get that I can't literally get everything that this person is going through when I don't know them, but their arrogant assumption that I just don't know what struggling is like is so mind boggling and absurd. 

I'm not gonna get into it on his post, because again, it's not about me, and it doesn't help to get defensive or start arguing with this guy. But, man. ""Things can get better even if you can't see how right now, and positive, life changing events can happen out of nowhere"" isn't exactly something I said out of privilege.

Things don't get better by themselves. The grass is greener where you water it. If you want it to get better, then you have to wait for the opportunity to make it better, and take every chance you have. Until then, all you can do sometimes is survive. That's harsh. That's reality. It's my own lived experience. 

I'm only in a relatively good position, in the sense that I have my fiancé's family and friends to lean on (and a fiancé), because I survived. Because I took every chance and opportunity. And I'm still one step away from homelessness, still disabled, still struggling. This isn't some ""it'll happen to you, because it happened to me"" shit; it's just recognition of the fact that things aren't as hopeless as they seem. Even if you can't see the way out of a bad situation, you might find one anyway. 

Honestly, I feel kind of stupid for wasting my time on this guy instead of scrolling past him, but I still can't convince myself that I should be less helpful toward strangers who might need perspective that other people probably won't offer them.

18485,1hef8x6,post,I'm done...,"I'm sorry if this isn't the best place to put this or if this is simply to much. I'm just not sure where else  or who else to talk to and I just can't keep burying all of this anymore so, please excuse me for everything being so random and the sheer volume of it.

I am a 24 year old female, I absolutely despise myself, and I have absolutely no will left to live....

To give you an idea of all the things I'm  working with, I am overweight and not at all in a hot or sexy curvy way. I am just fat with an apron belly. I'm not particularly attractive and there is truly nothing remarkable about me. I'm average in literally every area of my life. Even that may be a kind approach. I have never had a boyfriend. I have never even been approached except by women. And while I appreciate it, I am hopelessly heterosexual. If I'm honest, I feel like I actively repel men. I have dreams of being a wife and a mama but I have no courage to approach anyone myself. It's not for lack of trying, I'm just afraid and I would like to be pursued. This has a point, I promise.

I have always wanted to be an actress and I know, it is a difficult world to even attempt to break into. But I am good. I am really good. That is probably the only thing I am good at. I have loved the arts my entire life and I have been involved in them since I was a girl. I had my first opera lesson at 9 years old. I was too young to continue because my voice was still growing, but it was a start! I went to college for Musical Theater and I believe if I stayed and got my degree, I could be doing something with it. But, where I am now, anything thing that I have been blessed with, I have ruined. 

I am an only child of a single mama and we live with my grandpa who I take care of. I have never met my father (a dime a dozen story, I know) but needless to stay, I struggle with being ""loved."" My mama is my rock and honestly my other half. I KNOW that she loves me. I have never wanted for love where she is concerned, so I can't honestly say why I struggle with being loved. Daddy issues have quite a bit to do with it, I know. But I feel like I have a hole. 

We are not close at all with our family. Extended and non. My father's side of the family do not like my mother mainly because she is white. And they actively look down on my because I am mixed. I don't mean to bring race into this, but this is my experiences. But, I do have two family members who actively reach out and remind me that I am loved by them.
My mother's side is the worst side. With many of our family also being racist because I am ""tainted"" or ""dirty"" if you will. My grandfather and my grandmama (when she was alive) were really the only ones who broke away from the harmful ideals they were taught. They have NEVER treated me as my skin color. It is just me. 

It was within my  mama's side however,  where I was sexually assaulted as a girl by two different cousins male and female. The third time, came from a boy at school. It wasn't rape, thank God , but it was still enough. My mama, in an attempt to spare me from people who would blame me or somehow make the assault my fault, she didn't pursue any legal action. I don't blame her for this. I understand.  But needless to say, I think that's when my ""hole"" got bigger. 

I wanted to be loved by my family and that boy at school. I wanted to fill what was empty. But it didn't work. I wish it would have. As sick as it sounds, I could deal with it if I felt like they loved me.

I experienced bullying for my weight in school and it didn't help that no boys ever approached me. I wasn't allowed to date until 18, but it would have been nice to be called pretty. In High School that continued. The bullying from my peers stopped and instead, it was some of my teachers that were just bullies ""grown up."" My drama teacher was the worst of it. Gave me the entire ""you'll never make it"", ""your not good enough to do this"", etc. And still, no boy ever interested. When I went to college, the head of the drama department continued the same rhetoric and still, no man interested. But then my mama got sick. To put it lightly, she was dying. And I withdrew from school and came home because she needed help and no one else could do it. Yes I was miserable, but I was afraid I was going to lose one of the only people who loved me. Who saw me. She is my mama.

While she was recovering, I just started  auditioning for things. I got very small things that never amounted to anything and then the damn world shut down in 2020 thank to ""that which shall not be named"" and now... here we are in 2024.

I stopped auditioning for anything because I don't have time. As I mentioned earlier, me and my mama live with my grandpa. I act as his caregiver. He is self-sufficient for the most part, but it is imperative that I be avaliable to take him to an from his numerous doctor appointments and be overall available to him as much as possible. The job I have allows me to do this. But my job is terrible. I work at a private boys school in the theatre department and I am a director/ Costume designer. This is a very, very wealthy school and it sounds nice on paper and totally up my alley, but the school I work for is awful. I work over 60 hours on any given week. Most of this work is unaccounted for because I have a 1000 hour limit for the entire year that I am not allowed to exceed. Technically, I am not allowed to exceed 850 hours, but they gave me the full amount as a ""bonus."" 

I don't know if any of you have experience working in the theater on any side of it. But directing a show. A huge musical in three months AND doing costumes AND props all on my own... I have well exceeded my hours. I am giving this multi-million dollar school free labor and I have been for 3 years now. We have a skeleton team this year because of people retiring so I am doing three jobs on one piss poor salary. But I stay because it is the only job I have found that is willing to work with me when it comes to my grandfather. My mama can't really help because she works full time at least 10 hours everyday. There is literally no one else to do this because neither of them are willing to have government funded assistance. My grandfather doesn't want to lose his autonomy which I understand. And it is his house, his rules. 

I have no life outside of home. My ""life"" exists in a perfect circle and the rare time I get an opportunity to diverge from it, it is a damn bloodbath at home to deal with. I have a very small group of friends that I barely see. I'm talking 4 freaking people that has now dwindled down to 2 because of a falling out between two girls in the group. I have my best friend that I barely get to see or talk to and I feel like all I do is drag her down with all of my mess. She just got married and she has her own life. My other goof friend is getting married in the spring and the two girls in still friends with but aren't with eachother, all have their own life's and budding families. They have lives with so much life to give and I just... don't...

As I said, the bit of talent I have for theater and the arts, I don't use because I can't. I have friends that I can't relate to and honestly, hold back in my own ways. I have no relationship even though I want nothing more than that. I am useless at home and no real help there or at my job (words said by my mother and grandfather in fits of upset.) I have no degree, no life, no money, nothing. I'm 24 and I have nothing to show for it...

And I'm just done...

I'm so fucking numb and I'm tired... I am so tired...

I think I'm saying all of this because I honestly can't take anymore. 

I just want to be loved. I just want to be happy. I just want to be happy but I'm just not. What I didn't get into here was how much me and my mother fight. How volatile it is. Not physically but mentally and emotionally. To give you some of the highlights. She has said I am ""worthless."" That I ""do not want her to be happy."" That I'm stupid. A dumbass. And idiot. That I'm useless. And as often as it comes up, she says that ""I came home from college because of myself. I didn't do it for her."" 

I don't know how much more I have to do to prove that I love my family. That I want them to be happy. I don't know what else I'm supposed to do to prove it. I feel like my mama doesn't care about me anymore. She has a new life with her fiance and now it feels like she has abandoned me. It's not that I have separation anxiety. My entire life, I have championed her living her own life. I just didn't think she would completely cut me out of it.

My mother doesn't know how to apologize for anything. Something she learned from my grandfather (her father) She tries her best, but it is rare. Me on the other hand, I apologize for EVERYTHING. I'm not kidding. Everything. She raised me that way, I think to make me better than her. To give me more of a chance. But I go to far. I apologize for existing.

I just don't know what more to do. What... what did I do?... What is wrong with me?... I love and care about everyone in my life so much, but I don't feel hardly any of it. Or if it's there, I don’t feel worthy of it. What is wrong with me? It's got to be me right? I'm the comman denominator.

Anyway... I have no plan. No can I really do anything about this right now. But I'm going to kill myself. 

And before you say it you don't have to. I know I'm young. I know I have time. But I don't. 

Nothing is going to change and get better. Nothing will. I have all of these dreams of being an actress. Not famous, I don't want that, I just want to be able to work and make a living off of it. I want to be married. I want to be a mama. But I'm too fucking ugly for any man to ever want me and I'm fairly certain I have PCOS. And while it's not impossible, I know I'm going to have extreme difficulty getting pregnant even without it because my mama had a hard time getting pregnant with me. 

I am unwanted and unremarkable. I guarantee in a year, no one will care that I am gone. I believe in Jesus and have actively given my life to him. But I do not hear him. I feel alone in everything I do. And if I wasn't so afraid of going to hell, I would have killed myself a long time ago. But I just can't do this anymore. I hate leaving my puppies, I know they will be so confused, but I know they will be loved and taken care of. 

I'm not going to be able to do anything for at least 4-5 months as I am in a wedding for one of my only friends. I wouldn't dream of doing that too her. But after that, I'm thinking June. I don't know how. I want it to be painless. I'm just not sure what will be.

I'm so sorry for such a long winded and ridiculous post. I know it sounds like the biggest pity party and sob story ever. I don't mean to make it sound so dramatic. I'm theatrical but I don't mean to be it in a bad way... Thank you for listening to me. I appreciate it.","I'm done... I'm sorry if this isn't the best place to put this or if this is simply to much.

I have well exceeded my hours. I am giving this multi-million dollar school free labor and I have been for 3 years now. We have a skeleton team this year because of people retiring so I am doing three jobs on one piss poor salary. But I stay because it is the only job I have found that is willing to work with me when it comes to my grandfather. My mama can't really help because she works full time at least 10 hours everyday. There is literally no one else to do this because neither of them are willing to have government funded assistance. My grandfather doesn't want to lose his autonomy which I understand. And it is his house, his rules. 

I have no life outside of home. My ""life"" exists in a perfect circle and the rare time I get an opportunity to diverge from it, it is a damn bloodbath at home to deal with. I have a very small group of friends that I barely see. I'm talking 4 freaking people that has now dwindled down to 2 because of a falling out between two girls in the group. I have my best friend that I barely get to see or talk to and I feel like all I do is drag her down with all of my mess. She just got married and she has her own life. My other goof friend is getting married in the spring and the two girls in still friends with but aren't with eachother, all have their own life's and budding families. They have lives with so much life to give and I just... don't...

As I said, the bit of talent I have for theater and the arts, I don't use because I can't. I have friends that I can't relate to and honestly, hold back in my own ways. I have no relationship even though I want nothing more than that. I am useless at home and no real help there or at my job (words said by my mother and grandfather in fits of upset.) I have no degree, no life, no money, nothing. I'm 24 and I have nothing to show for it...

And I'm just done...

I'm so fucking numb and I'm tired... I am so tired...

I think I'm saying all of this because I honestly can't take anymore. 

I just want to be loved. I just want to be happy. I just want to be happy but I'm just not. What I didn't get into here was how much me and my mother fight. How volatile it is. Not physically but mentally and emotionally. To give you some of the highlights. She has said I am ""worthless."" That I ""do not want her to be happy."" That I'm stupid. A dumbass. And idiot. That I'm useless. And as often as it comes up, she says that ""I came home from college because of myself. I didn't do it for her."" 

I don't know how much more I have to do to prove that I love my family. That I want them to be happy. I don't know what else I'm supposed to do to prove it. I feel like my mama doesn't care about me anymore. She has a new life with her fiance and now it feels like she has abandoned me. It's not that I have separation anxiety. My entire life, I have championed her living her own life. I just didn't think she would completely cut me out of it.

My mother doesn't know how to apologize for anything. Something she learned from my grandfather (her father) She tries her best, but it is rare. Me on the other hand, I apologize for EVERYTHING. I'm not kidding. Everything. She raised me that way, I think to make me better than her. To give me more of a chance. But I go to far. I apologize for existing.

I just don't know what more to do. What... what did I do?... What is wrong with me?... I love and care about everyone in my life so much, but I don't feel hardly any of it. Or if it's there, I don’t feel worthy of it. What is wrong with me? It's got to be me right? I'm the comman denominator.

Anyway... I have no plan. No can I really do anything about this right now. But I'm going to kill myself. 

And before you say it you don't have to. I know I'm young. I know I have time. But I don't. 

Nothing is going to change and get better. Nothing will. I have all of these dreams of being an actress. Not famous, I don't want that, I just want to be able to work and make a living off of it. I want to be married. I want to be a mama. But I'm too fucking ugly for any man to ever want me and I'm fairly certain I have PCOS. And while it's not impossible, I know I'm going to have extreme difficulty getting pregnant even without it because my mama had a hard time getting pregnant with me. 

I am unwanted and unremarkable. I guarantee in a year, no one will care that I am gone. I believe in Jesus and have actively given my life to him. But I do not hear him. I feel alone in everything I do. And if I wasn't so afraid of going to hell, I would have killed myself a long time ago. But I just can't do this anymore. I hate leaving my puppies, I know they will be so confused, but I know they will be loved and taken care of. 

I'm not going to be able to do anything for at least 4-5 months as I am in a wedding for one of my only friends. I wouldn't dream of doing that too her. But after that, I'm thinking June. I don't know how. I want it to be painless. I'm just not sure what will be.

I'm so sorry for such a long winded and ridiculous post. I know it sounds like the biggest pity party and sob story ever. I don't mean to make it sound so dramatic. I'm theatrical but I don't mean to be it in a bad way... Thank you for listening to me. I appreciate it.",1,5,2024-12-14 23:15,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1hef8x6/im_done/,Neutral
18486,1hdx53x,post,my dad touched me while he thought I was asleep,"hi sorry this is kind of long, I just haven't been able to talk to anyone about it and it's killing me

***tw: sexual assault (not too graphic but I do describe it???)***

I (17F) and my dad recently went on a trip together to tour colleges. Planning was stressful and we definitely overpaid for plane tickets and hotels, but we eventually made it there in one piece.

Most of the trip was fine, except for some reason, my dad booked a king size bed for both of us (""to save on cost""). I was uncomfortable with the idea, but am kind of a pushover and didn't make a big deal out of it. 

For context, my dad is kind of a weird guy. He's kind of neglected me for my whole life, so we were never very close. However, shortly after my sophomore year started, he began trying to get close to me--like, really close. 

He would massage my back even though I was visibly uncomfortable, hug me for  too long, touch my thigh, put his head on my lap, etc. Which would be okay if he hadn't been super touch-averse my entire life. Long story short, it was really fucking weird.

I didn't think much of it, though, even though he frequently told me I was the only person who he really liked and stuff. Shortly before our trip, he literally said he was in love with me (""but not in a weird way""). I told my mom about it but we both dismissed it as him being a little weird. Surely he wouldn't do anything, right?

The trip went by without a hitch until shortly before we were to fly back. Sort of.

I would put a pillow up between us at night because I just didn't like the idea of sleeping next to a man...? idk, I thought it was ok maybe i was overreacting. But he would complain about it constantly, claiming that it was a ""physical manifestation of the emotional barrier between us"". He would always try to move it ...

He also had very weird discussions with me at night. He would talk about his old love life and shit, and he eventually got to talking about extremely sexual topics with me. He asked me questions like ""do you know all the different names for sucking dick"" and ""do you know all the sexual positions"" and even tried to demonstrate. ...

***ok the descriptions get worse here so uh be warned***

Anyway on the day of, it was late morning, probably 11 ish and we were finally sleeping in after having crazy hectic schedules the whole week. I woke up and kind of just laid there, but eventually felt my dad start to touch my hair. He began to sort of caress my face? Which wasn't so bad, so I didn't think much of it. But then his hand moved lower to my neck and then my collar and by this point I think my heart was racing. I was wondering if he would go under my shirt.

I was literally frozen for the rest of this. I dont know how to explain it, but its kind of like sleep paralysis where you are aware but totally unable to move.

His hand drifted under my shirt and over my bra, shaking the entire time. Anyway eventually he started touching me under the bra and was rubbing and touching my nips a ton. it was really fucking gross ngl.

He also squeezed my thigh and touched me all over the chest and stomach and around the waist of my underwear. I dont know how far he would have gone. 

The whole time I remember feeling almost vindicated? like I was like, ""damn, I finally figured out how fucked up you are"" and I was so... confused, because this was my dad. like, we share the same dna. and he like, watched me grow up.

I somehow managed to pretend to wake up here, and he stayed pressed against me. I think he was hard. 

idk, the worst thing is that it wasn't that bad? like he didn't rape me or physically harm me?? so maybe I'm overreacting????

I wish it had been a stranger. At least then I could still depend on my dad.

***things r not so bad from here!!***

I did not know what to think. Or do. Or anything. Everything is a blur after that. I think my dad left to get coffee and I called my mom and just cried. but I didn't tell her yet.

my dad got me muffins on his coffee run. consolation muffins. One lifetime of trauma for two shitty muffins.

I don't remember thr rest of things very well but I was very broken that day. He tried to say he was sorry one time and I told him I hated him. He didn't touch me that night.

I had to act normal the next day because it was the day we flew back. That was the worst part. I cried everywhere. On the train, on the whole plane ride back while my dad was chatting up some random woman.

Eventually I think a day after we got back I spilled the whole thing to my mom when we were alone. She took me to my aunt's and left me there for several weeks, but I was extremely depressed and lonely because my aunt was busy and I was pretty isolated there.

My mom has been a stay-at-home mom for 20 or so years, so she's pretty much entirely financially dependent on my dad. We live in an area where housing is extremely expensive. 

I eventually moved back into the house but have avoided my dad for 4.5 months now. 

My mom does not want to get a divorce from my dad. She has a bleeding heart when it comes to people she thinks depend on her. she loves me a lot and I love her too but she can be... idk

My dad is often sick or has headaches so she pities him and thinks she has to take care of him. She thinks she is the only one who can. She talks a lot about how she can ""heal him"" and ""protect"" me. My dad said that he was hallucinating from lack of sleep when it happened, so therefore he deserves a second chance. right?? ... I just don't want my mom to be stuck taking care of him forever, especially because he's kind of a jerk to her. she deserves better.

So far, my mom, dad, brother, and several close family members know.

I am depressed. I cry all the time for no reason. I feel so fucked up and I don't want to do anything or exist. My mom and I discussed therapy and she agreed to look into it, but she doesn't really believe in therapy in general and isn't really very great with mental health or anything (she gets upset when I'm sad, and even turns up the radio to block out the sounds of my crying lmao). So I think it's not going to happen. lol

My dad is going to pay for my college. My mom said she will make sure that happens. So I can't wait to graduate and gtfo of this shithole. College apps r killing me though

I feel disgusted when I look in the mirror. I am so confused and depressed. I miss my dad. I dont know what to do.

I can't report my dad because it will fuck things up for everyone. Ruin his life and make my family's very hard. So I am trapped here.

I have become one of the statistics--one of the 70% of people that never report. I know it's selfish and vindictive and emotional, but sometimes I wish I could report him.

I can't talk about this with anyone. Not my friends, peers, and my family is all involved so that doesn't help.

Sorry this is so long. I just wanted to vent. Thank you. <3

Does anybody else feel the same way as I do? I grew up in a very christian household. My family would always teach me the moral values in the bible and the do's and don't of it, including part where your body is a temple where you shouldn't ruin or harm it. I'm a 17 year old, female, and a firm believer of it but I want to kms. Although, I never harm myself no matter how much I want to. I never starve myself, I exercise weekly, I do well in school, and never neglect myself in any aspects, but I always wanted to die. 

I told this to my friends about this years ago but they don't seem to understand, I don't know the term of what I'm feeling, but everyone said that it is invalid, that I'm shaming people that actually is suicidal and wanting to go through it. But, everytime I go to school, I always dream that I want get hit by a car, or die in a calamity. I never feared death, but I always fear that I might go to hell if I ever did harm myself. I want other people to pull the trigger, but not by my own hands. If they do so I would feel the most grateful. I don't know anymore. I created this account just to vent. 

I once told my family about what I'm feeling, assuming that they might come to help me in some way shape or form. But, they just look at me and told me to pray more that if God's the reason why I'm not here hanging myself in the ceiling or slitting my wrist then he's doing the good work. I must pray harder is what they're saying. 

I really don't want to go through another day of living. I just sleep everything away, since that's the most closest thing of not feeling alive. After everything I've been through; being sexually assaulted, neglected, and among other things. God is the only thing that makes me want to walk in this earth. I can't kms

I'm a 17 year old, female, and a firm believer of it but I want to kms. Although, I never harm myself no matter how much I want to. I never starve myself, I exercise weekly, I do well in school, and never neglect myself in any aspects, but I always wanted to die. 

I told this to my friends about this years ago but they don't seem to understand, I don't know the term of what I'm feeling, but everyone said that it is invalid, that I'm shaming people that actually is suicidal and wanting to go through it. But, everytime I go to school, I always dream that I want get hit by a car, or die in a calamity. I never feared death, but I always fear that I might go to hell if I ever did harm myself. I want other people to pull the trigger, but not by my own hands. If they do so I would feel the most grateful. I don't know anymore. I created this account just to vent. 

I once told my family about what I'm feeling, assuming that they might come to help me in some way shape or form. But, they just look at me and told me to pray more that if God's the reason why I'm not here hanging myself in the ceiling or slitting my wrist then he's doing the good work. I must pray harder is what they're saying. 

I really don't want to go through another day of living. I just sleep everything away, since that's the most closest thing of not feeling alive. After everything I've been through; being sexually assaulted, neglected, and among other things. God is the only thing that makes me want to walk in this earth. I can't kms

18491,1h9dgqu,post,Was I assaulted? ,"I am having a hard time figuring out if my ex-boyfriend sexually assaulted me, or if it was something else. For context we are both trans men. He also has BPD, and I have PTSD from past relationships.

The relationship had been rocky for a long time, and he is pretty emotionally volatile. It was common for him to yell at me when he was upset, and he often got mad at me for saying ""no"" to things he wanted regardless of the context. He also started saying that I wasn't meeting his emotional needs, and that he needed sex to feel close to me.

My memories of the specific incident I am asking about are admittedly pretty hazy  and disjointed. Some of it I have a hard time putting in chronological order, and I think I dissociated for parts of it.

One time when I went to visit him, he wanted to have sex as soon as I arrived. I was tired and wanted to settle in first, but I went along with it without expressing this. At some point later in the night, we got in some kind of argument, I don't remember what about. I ended up bringing up the fact that I had felt uncomfortable earlier when we were having sex.

He immediately freaked out. I've definitely been on the other side of a conversation like that before, and I know first hand it doesn't feel great to be told the other person was uncomfortable. But he was really mad. I think I remember him throwing a pillow on the bed next to me and yelling. At some point he went from just being mad to something else. I really don't know how to describe it other than an ""episode."" He started crying and shaking. In conversations since then he described it as him getting triggered. He started saying it was my fault he was in this state, that I did this to him and that I had to fix it. He started trying to kiss me and I said no. He got more agitated and said over and over that I needed to help him. He essentially said that the only thing that would help him get through the trigger was me fucking him. I kept saying no, and that I couldn't. I tried non-sexual things like a massage, but he just got more and more agitated. It genuinely seemed like he was so out of it he couldn't move properly, or like he was frozen. He started pleading with me and saying ""please"" over and over. He called cruel for saying no again.

By this point I was a mess. I felt guilty, I felt disoriented, I still felt off about sex we had earlier, and now this person was having an absolute melt down in front of me. I was crying and eventually just ended up slumped over next to him while he berated me. The sun started to come up and it was the next day.

At some point something shifted and he seemed to notice I was in distress. He started to kiss me and touch me and told me he was going to help me. I told him no, and started to cry harder. He got visibly frustrated and started to pull away from me. I had this sinking feeling that things were about to get much worse or that he would storm out and leave. I sobbed out that I felt like I didn't deserve help. I think in the mindspace I was in, I recognized that he wasn't going to offer me any genuine help, only sex, but that also if I didn't accept it things would get worse or he'd leave. By this point I was fully convinced everything was my fault and that I had done something awful. I wanted it to be over, and I wanted to be held or comforted. I was in a city where I didn't know anyone else.

He told me he didn't want to leave like this, and that he wanted to ""help."" I finally caved and said yes. We had sex but I don't remember any of it.

After he was done he told me that everything that happened was my fault, and that he knew he was supposed to apologize to me but that I should actually apologize to him and that he never wanted to hear about it again.

He was mad all week because I was distant and spacey.

I put it out of my mind for a few months until other abusive behaviors in the relationship made me reevaluate things.

I feel like I might have been assaulted, but I believe in a high degree of personal responsibility during sex and I did eventually say yes.

I broke up with him two months ago, but we share a lot of the same social circles and he wants to be friends.

He's written me letters apologizing in great detail for other forms of abusive behavior, and made a bunch of promises to change.

In conversations since then he's blamed much of his bad behavior on BPD. He bought me a book on BPD, and whenever I've called him on continued bad behavior he's gotten mad at me and told me that I'm not being empathetic to his mental illness.

I pointed out other times he was sexually coercive, and sent him an article on sexual coercion during one argument. He got mad and dismissed me and said that I had ""hurt him sexually too."" It felt so demeaning and like a slap in the face. He's blocked for now but I have to run into him places.

I also miss him, and I miss the friend and companion I thought I had.","Was I assaulted?  I am having a hard time figuring out if my ex-boyfriend sexually assaulted me, or if it was something else. For context we are both trans men. He also has BPD, and I have PTSD from past relationships.

18496,1h73vd6,post,any advice?,"Okay, so Hi. Please keep in mind that I'll only be using fake names to conceal he identities of everyone that will be mentioned in this post. Also, if you're homophobic, I suggest you don't read this.

I'm Eli, (30F). I am happily married to my wife, Sapphire (30F), and we live with my son, August (16M) and our adopted child, Lily (6F).

If you're asking, yes; I did give birth to my son when I was just 14. That's the fist story I'm going to tell you. So for context, I have 2 older brothers and a younger one. The eldest, Ace, is like a father figure to me-more than what our dad could have been. The second oldest, Cameron, treats me like his best friend, often teasing me and inviting me to play video games with him. Meanwhile, my younger brother, Simon, was the one who I barely talk to, because according to our father, Arthur, I'm just going to be a bad influence to his golden child. My dad was one of the few who believed that females are low, unvaluable people, which was exactly why his marriage with our mother always had cracks. Growing up, my father despised me, ignoring everything I did to make him proud. I always clung to the hope that perhaps someday, he will love me like my brothers-but that was shattered when I was sexually assaulted with a man I barely knew.

A few weeks after that incident, I found out I was pregnant, and my father became furious, calling me all sorts of names. After that, he kicked me out and I lived on the streets for a few days until my best friend, and now spouse, Sapphire found me, along with her parents, as they drove by the street which I was currently sleeping at. She approached me and told me to come home with them. At first, I refused-I wasn't that thick-skinned, but she insisted, and so did her parents. In the end, we drove back to their home, and there, they asked what had happened. I told them the story and to my surprise, Sapph's father, Gabriel, offered for me to stay with them. You see, Sapphire's was pretty rich and they had a big house, and it just so happened that there was a guest room where I can stay.

So, for a few months, I stayed there, taking modular classes from Sapphire's school that offered it for those who can't go to school personally. Her mom, Lisa, was there for all my checkups, ensuring that unborn August and I were in good condition. I continued that until the day that I gave birth. Instead of a normal delivery, the doctors advised that I undergo C-Section because my body would not be able to handle pushing a baby out of me. The moment I held my son, was the happiest moment of my life, and I won't be able to forget it.

So, fast-forward to years later, Sapphire and I were able to graduate, and I started my business from there with the help of Gabriel. Sapphire's parents knew we both had feelings for each other back when we were still studying and was very supportive. A few years more, that business of mine grew to become a successful company that was now making millions. Once, I had enough to ensure a great future, I proposed to Sapphire and soon, we got married.

Then, we decided to build our own home on another country, which was where we adopted Lily. Lily had a problem with her voice box, refraining her from speaking normally and she would often stutter or struggle to speak, but we all loved her nonetheless, especially her older brother who doted on her.

Now back to the present.   
A few days ago, our little family were eating at a restaurant when someone approached us. When I looked at who it was, I was shocked to see Ace, Cameron, and Simon there. They said that they were in the country for a vacation trip and was equally surprised to see me. Ace said he barely even recognized me anymore, considering the change of clothing style and behavior. I introduced them to my wife, daughter and son. I gestured to August and they instantly saw our similarities, quickly understanding that he was the baby I was pregnant with 16 years ago. We had a chat, but I noticed that Lily was getting tired so we excused ourselves. I asked for Ace's number so we can finally contact each other then left.

Now, earlier this morning, I received a message from him, saying that mom, the only parent who truly cared, loved and nurtured me for 14 years, the one who shielded me from my father, and the others, including dad, wanted to meet me, if I was willing to fly back to my hometown. 

So, people of Reddit, what should I do?","any advice? Okay, so Hi. Please keep in mind that I'll only be using fake names to conceal he identities of everyone that will be mentioned in this post. Also, if you're homophobic, I suggest you don't read this.

18497,1h710el,post,I've had real bad intrusive thoughts forever,"This isn't that big of a deal maybe, I don't know, it doesn't feel as serious as a lot of these. Just something that's been eating me up for a while. 

For as long as I can remember id get random and very detailed intrusive thoughts of being sexually assaulted by any man around me. It might have started when I was around 5 or 6? I don't know why it started, I don't know why it happens. They last like 10 or 15 minutes at a time, I can try to stop it but it just kinda makes it worse. By detailed I mean, like, the actual assault to telling my family or friends about it, the legal process after, I'd imagine them killing me or the people around me if I told anyone, or how coming out would ruin my relationships depending on who it is. 

When I say any man I do mean any. It's been friends, family members, partners of my friends, strangers, any man at all, no matter their age or relationship. Never women, which makes me feel really bad. I don't hate men, it doesn't affect my relationships with the men around me, or at least I don't think It does. 

And to clarify I don't think I've ever been sexually assaulted in the past. There was a kinda explicit ""game"" I'd play with my SLIGHTLY older cousin as a kid, but I don't think either of us really knew it was sexual, and it didn't have any lasting effect on me.

I don't think he's ever been the subject to any of these thoughts, but Ive known him since I was, like, 11 so I can't say for that portion of my life, but in recent years no.

Just something that's been eating me up for a while. 

For as long as I can remember id get random and very detailed intrusive thoughts of being sexually assaulted by any man around me. It might have started when I was around 5 or 6? I don't know why it started, I don't know why it happens. They last like 10 or 15 minutes at a time, I can try to stop it but it just kinda makes it worse. By detailed I mean, like, the actual assault to telling my family or friends about it, the legal process after, I'd imagine them killing me or the people around me if I told anyone, or how coming out would ruin my relationships depending on who it is.

18498,1h6jk9n,post,"Nobody knows how my ex treated me and it wasn’t even that bad, but I still feel wronged. ","Everybody still likes my ex… 

I’m a bit of a strange person but I’m really not so hate-able, I imagine. I have a number of good friends and they’re pretty chill too. 

When I broke up with my ex, it was already coming for a really long time. We both knew it. Our relationship was coming to an end. I was unsatisfied with the way he’d treat me. I didn’t like how he’d continue to insist on having sex even if I didn’t really feel like it. I didn’t like how he got jealous of me hanging out with friends (both male and female). I didn’t like how he would act so excited to talk to his other friends but not me. I didn’t like how he wouldn’t really want to do anything other than stay at home and cuddle (which caused me to miss out on a lot of opportunities to hang out with other friends). Some of our problems were specifically him being a bad boyfriend, some were me being a bad girlfriend (like being clingy), some of them were just incompatibility. 

But when we broke up, things turned sour so quickly. He started offering to buy me things or make me things. It was the whole “I didn’t realize how much I liked you.” Well, buddy, it was too late for all that. He would start trying to text or call me everyday, to the point where I actually screamed at him in public over the phone (extremely atypical behavior for me) once to get him to stop talking to me. 

Over the summer, he would hit me up and casually offer sex/fwb and I was like sureee maybe. One of my toxic traits is my inability to enforce boundaries.. aka I find it hard to just say no. But it’s not like our sex was good either? He also knows I generally have a very low libido? So I really have no idea what he thought he was offering. 

Still, I wanted to kind of stay friends with him, mostly because we had a LOT of mutual friends and I didn’t want it to be awkward for anyone. I really didn’t want anyone to “choose” (spoiler alert- they kinda did). So I took him up on his offer to hang out, just for a bit. We were kinda okay, it wasn’t too awkward, and then he started trying to cuddle with me. At first I was like “sure that’s okay” and then he started touching me, which was something I definitely was not okay with. I jumped out of the bed (the only piece of furniture in the house and he insisted we be on the bed as opposed to the floor). I looked at him kinda shocked. He just looked blissfully unaware and asked me what happened. I was like okay maybe he didn’t mean to, so I just got back on the bed (staying over the covers) to continue watching our show. Skip forward to the part where he continues to make advances and I’m incredibly awkward so I just start talking about how suicidal I’ve been feeling (to get him to stop). And then I go home. 

And then I talk to him about it the next day. I said something like hey I wasn’t comfortable with what happened, and what he responded with genuinely sent chills down my spine and I felt immediately violated and betrayed. He said something like “yeah I did it on purpose because if you reciprocated then we would’ve had sex, and if you ended up hating me over it and stopped being my friend that would be good for me too. So it was a win win.” The context being that he wanted to stop being my friend but was too cowardly to do it himself… so he intentionally assaulted me (just touching) so I would stop being friends with him? It was either use me for sex or make me feel violated? I stopped all contact with him after that. 

And the following year, I started hearing rumors about me. Really really terrible rumors about how mentally ill I was, about how I’m such a crazy person who needs to get medicated, about how I’m a sl-t and I was probably cheating on him, etc etc. He was always the type to rant to his friends about me, so no doubt the rumors came from him. I was the type to always keep private affairs private, so I had nobody I could talk to. Not even my friends. I once confided in them in how I felt about the rumors and they said “it’s just rumors! They don’t matter!” I noticed how some of my friends kind of looked at me weirdly, as if they didn’t really trust me or anything. Nobody felt the need to tell me anything. It was all just stuff I picked up on. 

I felt so wronged. I really did. All this happened about a year ago, but I still have these feelings welled up inside me. I’ve repaired the weirdness in my friendships by explaining my side of the story and I’ve made another really good friend as well. But all of this still haunts me. A bunch of people, including the less-close friends who I couldn’t explain anything to, think I’m some sort of terrible villain. They think I was this terrible toxic girlfriend who became this terrible toxic ex. I just wish I wasn’t perceived in that way. None of those people are in my life anymore, for the record. But it just stings, knowing that I felt used for sex the entire time we were together, knowing that I felt incredibly insecure because of the way he’d talk to other people vs me, knowing the real reason we stopped being friends… and knowing that he’s actually this very smart person who everybody appreciates because he’s always happy to help them. 

I still don’t think he’s a bad person. I don’t think he’d sexually assault or rape anyone, and I’m sure he’ll treat his next girlfriend way better (I was told that he went on an actual date, smth we never really did, with somebody from Bumble and paid for an expensive dinner, smth he never did despite earning tons of money, which I didn’t mind because I believe in paying for my own food but I will admit it would’ve been nice to have been treated to nice meals). But I also don’t think I deserved any of that. What did I do so wrong to get all of this hate? How come he gets to nearly sexually assault me and he gets away with it? I wish I could tell all of his friends that this is who he was, but I’m sure they wouldn’t believe me. Partially because they think he’s so vanilla (I mean he is) and partially because I’d probably just sound like an evil ex who wants to ruin his life. 

I don’t. I just want the hate to stop. ","Nobody knows how my ex treated me and it wasn’t even that bad, but I still feel wronged.  Everybody still likes my ex…

when i was in middle school, i had a serious eating disorder related to food insecurity. i didn’t know when i would have food (i had four other siblings and basically one caregiver to provide), so i’d push off eating it onto other people and eventually it started to feel good. being in control of my own body, being the master of it. i’ve experienced so much sexual assault and abuse and psychological abuse that i’ve always felt i belong to someone else. my existence is owed to the ones around me, who’ve sacrificed so much to keep me alive. and i’m grateful, but it’s so exhausting to never feel like your own body is yours, or that your entire life is going to be spent paying back your family for loving you. being hungry is a decision i got to make, and i kept making it, and i’ve always been a bigger girl but people would go “oh, you’re losing weight! i’m proud of you! looking good!” and it’d feel so good. god, it’d feel SO good. eventually, people started noticing that i never ate anything (except for sweets, i don’t pass up a dessert) and my school counselor became really involved, she wanted my caregiver wanted to send me away to some institution for recovery. i didn’t want to, so i tightened tf up and recovered at home. it was hard, and i went through it silently. i have stretch marks on my tummy from it that i’m really insecure about. but i lived to tell the tale. 

but things happen, and i gained a LOT of weight during COVID. i didn’t mind it; in fact, i generally thought my body looked really cute with extra weight on it, especially because i’d look sickly for a good two years. but people made comments, and i have a hard time noticing when people are being mean to me, so i didn’t start realizing it was a problem until now. there are so many things i’m just now realizing people don’t like about me: that i’m loud, that i can be direct, that i’m serious, and that i’m fat. i’m fat. i can’t believe i’m typing that out. i’ve never thought i was fat until now, and it’s at the worst part in my life, when i’m just starting to figure things out. my caregiver never taught me anything, everything i’ve done in my life i’ve done on my own. i got into college alone, i filled out the fafsa alone. i moved towns alone. i started taking driving classes alone, and i’m getting my license alone. and my caregiver how any of this has affected me, nor do they care. 

now, everything is so close to falling into place. i just have to learn to be quieter and become a skinny legend, and i don’t think all of this happened quickly. no, it’s little things. all my plus-sized friends are starting to lose more weight, i’m the only one who’s stayed the same. i know you’re supposed to be happy for your friends, but i constantly feel that i’m not normal like they are, and when i lag behind them i feel like there’s this big blaring sign pointing to me screaming “NOT NORMAL WEIRD ODD UNUSUAL DOESN’T KNOW ANYTHING”. and i am happy that everyone’s getting healthier and sexier, i love them, i just wish that i was like them. so, two weekends ago, i didn’t have anything to eat when i got home from work. and the hunger the next morning felt like a high. it’s almost been two weeks, and i’m excited to see a change. it feels good, like coming home. 

there are so many people who love me who would be heartbroken to hear this, and i’m hiding it well, i think. i have rules i stick to so nobody notices, i learned from the first time. i’m already daydreaming about fitting into a smaller size. 

thank you for listening. i don’t need advice or sympathy or anything. just needed to get this giddy feeling off my chest, and i’m not trying to promote this behavior at all, i’m obviously some type of mentally ill. be kind to those around you, and love yourself. food is fuel.

18502,1h50bve,post,My (now ex) boyfriend never took “no” for an answer,"Ive been going through a breakup the past two months and I’ve been taking time to reflect on the things that went well and the things that bothered me during the relationship. I was journaling about it when one of my biggest issues during the relationship came up - my ex would constantly touch me even when I would tell him no and show him I wasn’t into it. 

My boyfriend and I had been together for a year and a half and all throughout the relationship, he would try to touch me sexually. I could be working from home, showering, baking, doing dishes, anything - and he’d spend his time trying to turn me on. Touching my boobs, my butt, pressing himself into me- constantly trying to stimulate me. In the span of an hour I’d tell him no maybe 20times. I would spend my time telling him no, and even physically trying to put distance between us but he always came back a bit later trying again. If I told him no he’d guilt me saying that I didn’t want him. 

It got to a point where I would make up excuses as to why we couldn’t hang out at my place. I would always try to redirect to see him out in public instead of my place where I lived alone so I wouldn’t be subject to his constant touching. I would suggest going to his place instead because he had roommates whereas if we were at my place we were by ourselves and there would be no excuse for him not to touch me. If we spent one night a week at my place, the second he left I felt relief because I would have a few “free days” before he’d push to come over again. I would stress so much about him coming by because he couldn’t take no for an answer. After a year, I’d come up with any excuse when he tried touching me- I have a migraine, I’ve got to cook dinner, let’s go for a walk.. anything. I felt repulsed by his touch because I didn’t feel I had a choice. If I said no he’d be so upset with me. I couldn’t even watch tv shows or movies with sexual scenes - I had to skip through them because I felt sick to my stomach watching them. 

He never actually 🍇 me.. but I can’t help but wondering if he sexually assaulted me. It sounds stupid- shouldn’t I know if he did? Or am I just overreacting and villainising him? I guess in the end it doesn’t actually matter since we’re no longer together but I just can’t get this out of my head","My (now ex) boyfriend never took “no” for an answer Ive been going through a breakup the past two months and I’ve been taking time to reflect on the things that went well and the things that bothered me during the relationship.

-girls in Afghanistan sold to old men 
-age of marriage lowered to 9 in Iraq 
-man sexually assaults partner in the UK to the point where they had to surgically remove her tampon 
-US - layken Riley

18506,1h0xhii,post,"Update: ex is a serial predator and I went to the police, yet I feel guilty for going because I’m the only one who “betrayed him” ","TW: sexual abuse of minors, sexual abuse, physical abuse
Does anyone who has gone to the police for someone who has done terrible things or know someone who does, how did you overcome the guilt of being the one who “betrayed” them so to speak? 

I have felt suicidal from it. I have wrote before about some of the things my ex did that were questionable but I never seemed to have full proof other than some admissions, however I live in a 2 party consent state. I recently learned more after a conversation with him where he admitted to more but still not enough for the police, but enough for them to be actively investigating and tracking his phone now. I’m not sure how likely he will be tried.


He has sexually assaulted me and many other women. He refers to it as “having sex with women when they don’t want to” to make himself feel better I guess. When he told me about the 16 year old he said it would ruin his life because he’s already had “to live in the shadows” and that is punishment enough so if anything happened to him or she came forward it would just make his life so much worse. 


This man is absolutely vile for many things he’s done although he frequently reminded me of how much he has done to be a better person. I felt guilt around that because I did want to see him get help and become a better person. Yet, he hasn’t stopped too much because of just what I have experienced in our relationship and some of the questionable things on his porn activity and him potentially even grooming a 17 year old during our relationship. 


I know he’s terrible. He deserves to be locked up, he has hurt so many women and at least 2 girls I have realized. He has been doing this for 22 years. The last time I talked to him, his therapist is sympathizing with him and telling him to stop talking down about himself so much (he frequently talked down about himself and I thought it was him feeling bad for the things he’s done but he doesn’t experience true accountability) and it just made me livid inside because he has so many wrapped around his finger. The reason he has gotten away with so much is because of enablers like me (not anymore) and all his victims silence and his ability to charm people. He told me he doesn’t experience much empathy and lost his soul. He pushed me but there were parts that you would never know he pushed a woman because he could be so thoughtful in other ways


All this said, because of the “good parts” of him I feel such guilt. I feel shame that I feel guilt. I feel shame that a part of me still cares for him. I feel shame around virtually everything and if there is one thing I’ve learned is people like him hide it so well. Many red flags but still hide it behind the charm. 

He doesn’t fit some of the stereotypes of a predator. Other than him telling me certain things, if it wasn’t for me going through his phone after some of what he told me trying to figure out if there was more, would I have known how predatory he is. He definitely now isn’t going to tell the next women/girls what he has done because he has learned from my own interrogation of him how to be more covert and I just pray so much that he gets convicted and tried so that can’t happen. Also so I don’t live in a world where I gaslight myself daily that was I experienced was real and the same person I loved and protected me and could be so kind, especially to others, was also a monster behind closed doors. I have lost my faith in humanity and in myself. I don’t trust anyone and I now think anyone could be a predator and that seemingly innocent behavior could potentially be a dangerous person. 

He told me most men are like this, and I used to want to be a mother but now I’m terrified. Mostly, I hate myself for not saying something sooner and I hate myself for also feeling guilt in coming forward when he has so many people (INCLUDING A COUPLE OF THE WOMEN THEMSELVES THAT WERE RAPED BY HIM) are obsessed with him! Adore him! It makes me feel like I destroyed his life in some way and that I am the bad guy. 

He proposed to me the week after I went to the police and said I am his soulmate he felt safest with me and that I am one person he knows he can trust and helped him become a better man and person and he wants to continue on that path and without me he wouldn’t have considered therapy for himself. I cried and vomited by myself after. I loved this man so much and I believe him that he really does feel this way, but how horrific. There is no way my soulmate is a serial rapist and sexual predator. About a year before I met him I did classes on recognizing situations or predators like him, and yet I completely missed it. 


This is the first time in my life I have so desperately turned to God for help, I have never felt more alone. I don’t even feel like I can talk to my therapist because of how vile some of this is and despite everything, I feel like I was an accomplice for not coming to the police 6 months ago when I started realizing there was more to what he has done. 
I am rambling now, but I don’t know where to turn. I am just trying to remind myself all the time that I did the right thing, I just feel terrible and even worse honestly than I did when I was with him.

18507,1h0kpvx,post,"My (30M) partner (31M) assaulted me while I was asleep, apologized, and then denied it ever happened.","TW: Sexual Assault, Gaslighting

Sorry, guys, I am not a native speaker, and not even a usual reddit user. I am just scared, lost, confused and in big need of advice.

On Friday night, my partner picked me up after work. After a long and exhausting day, we decided to unwind at a bar. We both got quite drunk, and at some point, we also used substances. This isn’t uncommon for us—we sometimes end up staying up late watching explicit content together, but it’s always consensual, and we usually don’t engage in anything physical afterward.

That night, however, I had to work early the next morning, so I decided to sleep. To help myself fall asleep, I drank more alcohol and managed to get a few hours of rest before work. When I woke up, I felt sharp discomfort and pain that wasn’t there before I went to bed. I couldn’t ignore it and quickly pieced together that my partner might have done something to me while I was asleep.

I was in shock, blaming myself and trying to rationalize what happened. I didn’t bring it up that day, but it weighed heavily on me. The following evening, we attended a friend’s birthday party. I ended up drinking a lot, trying to push my feelings aside, but eventually, I felt bold enough to confront him.

When I told him what I thought had happened, he initially dismissed it, saying I was drunk and imagining things. I told him I didn’t want him in my home or my life anymore. He followed me home anyway, insisting that he was sorry and scared about what might happen next. At one point, he admitted to what he did, broke down in tears, and apologized repeatedly. I was overwhelmed and let him back inside, thinking we’d have time to process this later.

Over the next couple of days, I tried to understand how this could happen. My partner has made certain comments in the past, like joking about scenarios where one of us is asleep or how some videos we watch feel eerily familiar. Looking back, these comments now make me deeply uncomfortable.

When we finally sat down to talk again, his demeanor had completely changed. He denied everything, said I must have misinterpreted the situation, and even blamed the discomfort I felt on something unrelated. When I reminded him of his previous apology, he brushed it off, claiming he only said it to calm me down.

I’m at a loss. He’s behaving like nothing happened, even asking me to do chores as if everything is normal. I’m confused and scared, but I also still care about him and wonder if he’s struggling with his own issues or losing touch with reality. At the same time, I feel manipulated and gaslit.

18513,1gwwlip,post,Men Don’t Care About Men,"Men, as a group, don’t seem to care about other men. We’re the first ones to tear each other down, dismiss each other’s struggles, or perpetuate toxic cycles that harm us all. Think about the harsh societal expectations placed on men. We’re told to always be tough, to suppress emotions, to provide without complaint, and to never show vulnerability. But whenever someone critiques these toxic standards, who rushes in to defend and reinforce them? Other men. Instead of questioning why we’re told to “man up” or why expressing emotions is seen as weak, we attack the person pointing it out, doubling down on these harmful norms. It’s like we’re our own worst enemy.

Men complain about women’s history Month or pride month, and say “Men’s Day?” It exists, International Men’s Day exists (November 19), yet men do nothing for it. There are no events, no advocacy, no awareness being raised. Men are quick to complain about other groups uplifting themselves but completely unwilling to do the same for men. Instead of taking action, we sit around bitterly pointing fingers at others who are doing the work we refuse to do.

Male abuse, sexual assault, and rape victims are often downplayed, but it’s almost always other men downplaying it. If a man is abused by a woman, his trauma is mocked or dismissed. He’ll get called a degrading insults because he couldn’t defend himself against a woman, instead of genuine support. To make it worse, adult men glorify female predators who sexually assault adolescent/teenage boys, treating it as some twisted accomplishment instead of what it really is—abuse. Men usually teach young boys that this sort behavior is okay, and that any sort of sexual attention from adult women should be welcomed. And if they don’t like it, they’re perceived as gay. We perpetuate harmful ideas about consent and shame men for being vulnerable or speaking out about their pain.

When men seek therapy, open up about mental health, or show fear, they’re labeled as weak or mocked outright. From a young age, boys are taught that being “manly” means dominating others, being aggressive, and avoiding anything deemed “feminine.” Who teaches this? Men. We shame boys who cry, shame hobbies that aren’t traditionally masculine, and ostracize men who don’t conform. We’ve built this prison of hypermasculinity ourselves, and then we complain about being trapped in it.

So why do we sabotage our own well being? Why do we expect others—women, or society at large—to fix issues we refuse to address ourselves? Self advocacy is the key to progress, but instead of taking action, we undermine the efforts of those who try to help. If men really cared about men, we’d be dismantling toxic masculinity, uplifting male victims, celebrating each other’s successes, and fighting for our collective well being. Until we start doing that, we can’t expect others to care about us when we clearly don’t care about ourselves.","Men Don’t Care About Men Men, as a group, don’t seem to care about other men.

18514,1gwbfon,post,Always felt like I've to accommodate others to keep friends around,"I (25F) had a traumatic childhood event when I was around 13. A teacher of mine touched me inappropriately twice and in public (no batted an eye), I came from after the second incident and told my dad about it. My parents were smart enough to teach me good touch-bad touch and I complained. My dad, of course, went berserk. Went to the school, complained to the principal and sent in a formal letter asking that he be sacked or reprimanded. Nothing happened. He was still teaching at the school and I was left wondering what happened. Fast forward a year later, my teacher gathered students from my class (the ones that were in his private tuition classes) and conspired to complain to the school authorities that I was 'sexually provoking' the boys in my class. I was 13, I didn't do any of it. He made a huge fuss and started calling the parents of my class (female students' parents) to not let them speak or be friendly with me. My friends dropped me and I was alone the whole year, on top of that, I was the scandal of the school for everyone to gossip about. I was a good student and my parents asked me to hold my head high because I hadn't done anything, but it was a cruel year. I started being very depressed, suicidal and self-harmed regularly. In hindsight, my parents should have changed schools, but I also understand that money was tight. Anyway, at the end of the year, I found out (by chance) that he had been leaking exam papers of his course to his private tuition students beforehand. I had found a copy of it lying around (I know, very convenient) and took it to my dad. My dad then went to the board and complained again and only this time, he was sacked. It also started getting out that I was not the only person he assaulted, there were other students and female teachers who went through a similar incident. Shit school, I know.   
  
The background was necessary because I carry the trauma with me. I see my therapist on and off. I struggle with self-harm and only went clean a year ago. I am not suicidal anymore, but I often think about it, especially when it comes to my relationships (romantic or platonic). I like to believe that I am always going overboard with people I care about. I make time for them in their times of need, I make a big deal of their birthdays, I am always mindful about how I speak to them (I know words hurt, so I am careful when I even criticise anything), I don't usually tell them if something bothers me because I assume that it wasn't on purpose, and I always try to see the other side of the coin. In general, I think I am a very good friend. I hold myself accountable for my actions and am not afraid of an uncomfortable conversation. Now, this is not me saying this, my friends also agree. But, sometimes, I feel like I'm overaccommodating everyone around me. I drain myself to be there for them, irrespective of anything. I do not expect anything in return, trust me. But, sometimes, the only times when I do tell my friends about something that hurt me, they will not take it nicely. They're either dismissive or just too busy. I have severe anxiety, so every time I'm blindsided or shut off, I have a very emotional and physical reaction that my friends will drop me. It's like going back to my school year when my friends dropped me out of nowhere. I am just frustrated and incredibly sad that I am always left as an afterthought and people don't even think twice to drop me. 

TLDR; I overaccommodate my friends and when they don't reciprocate to my issues, I relive my childhood trauma.

18515,1gw4ez6,post,Was I assaulted?,"I don’t know if I’ve been sexually assaulted. Very recently, I stopped talking to a boy that was in my life for about 7 weeks. Early in our talking stage, he opened up about a past situation where a girl accused him of sexual assault. He told me that when he confronted her about it, she said things like, “What are you gonna do about it?” and “Are you gonna pay me?” He painted her as very manipulative. At the time, I believed him because of other things I’d heard about her, and I wrote off the possibility that he had actually assaulted her.

About two weeks ago, I ended things with him, saying I wasn’t ready for a relationship (which was true). However, he kept pushing to talk to me. I ended up speaking to him for about a week and a half before finally cutting off all contact. Even then, he kept spam-calling and texting me and repeatedly crossed my boundaries, both in terms of communication and physically showing up.

For example, I left a hoodie in his car, and when I told him I didn’t want or need it back, he insisted I would be getting it regardless. He said he’d come while I was at basketball practice and give it to one of my roommates. When I called to tell him not to bring it, he was already 10 minutes away from my dorm.

When I started reflecting, I began thinking about our sexual interactions which was limited at fingering. At first, I was okay with it. But there were times when I’d want to just hang out and watch a movie, and he’d start kissing my neck or moving his hand to my crotch. This happened multiple times. Sometimes I let it go, but other times I’d ask him to stop and just watch the movie. He would stop temporarily but would usually try again later.

At the time, I didn’t realize how uncomfortable it made me feel. The part that confuses me is that later in the night, I’d often become more open to doing something sexual. It’s not like he scared me as a person, but I feel like so many of my boundaries were crossed, and this feels like one of them.

I also learned more about the other girl’s side of the story through a mutual friend. She said she was really drunk—almost blackout—and felt like she couldn’t give proper consent. She had really liked him before, but the incident changed how she felt about him.

It makes me deeply uncomfortable to even consider the possibility of being sexually assaulted or molested. I feel confused and conflicted. But the more I think about it, the more I believe he did sexually assault that girl—and I’m struggling with what that means for me.

TL; DR

I recently stopped talking to a boy that left me feeling unsettled. Early on, he told me about a girl who accused him of assault, but he painted her as manipulative, so I dismissed it.

Looking back, he often crossed my boundaries. During hangouts, he’d touch me when I just wanted to watch a movie. I’d ask him to stop, and he would briefly, but he’d usually try again. While I sometimes became receptive later, the repeated disregard for my boundaries left me uncomfortable.

I also heard the other girl’s side—she said she was too drunk to consent, which makes me believe her now. Reflecting on all of this has left me confused and unsettled.","Was I assaulted?

18516,1gvguf1,post,My uncle just got arrested ,"I'm not even sure this is the right community for this but I need to post this somewhere and say this to someone. My uncle just got arrested for sexually assaulting and drugging another family member repeatedly over the years. Beginning in Elementary school. No one in this household believes that he is guilty except me because I KNOW with everything that he is guilty. I thought he changed. I honestly thought he changed and was getting better. He was getting sober and clean and making up with the family and I believed him. No one thinks he is guilty and that she is lying but I know what hes done I've been on the receiving end and I didn't say anything because he wanted to get sober and clean and he wasn't going to do it anymore and I was a kid and I didn't want to break up the family because I'm just really dumb especially knowing now what he did again.

I did admit that I believed her when everything came out but everyone says she is lying. I don't think she is because of some specific things she mentioned to the police and school. I know false accusations ruin lives but I really don't think this is one, and he has done it before. 

I've thought aobut saying something but this is really wrecking our family with mostly people are against her because they say she's lying and I'm not as brave as she is and his bond is incredibly high and wit everything she has said I don't think that anything would change if I were to say anything because I think she said some things where I doubt he will ever get released. I guess the drug tests and the kit really confirmed what she has told them. I don't think she's being malicious or want to ruin lives. Hes done it before. Then there's that. Am I held responsible for not telling anyone because maybe she wouldn't have had it happen if I did but I need to talk to my cousin because I don't think i Was the only one but they also never really said either way but I don't think she believes that he is innocent either. 

The house is tense. The defence for him is that he had a very hard life and needs our support and I don't disagree but that does not mean he did not do it. Everyone is mad and because this is all within the family there is so much yelling and people are obvioulsy not happy. She has almost no support and I do want to reach out to her but I will get into trouble but I do feel bad because everyone is mad at her.

His bail is really high I don't think we have enough money to get him out and I'm thankful because I really think that they would if they could and I do hope he goes to jail for the rest of his life.","My uncle just got arrested  I'm not even sure this is the right community for this but I need to post this somewhere and say this to someone.

18517,1guuqn2,post,"My narcissistic ex told his friends I was the abuser, so I posted a video of him hitting me. Now he’s trying to get a “gag order” on me ","I’m not even making this up. This is 100% real. My ex boyfriend of a LONG time was physically and sexually abusive of me, especially more towards the end of our relationship. He never beat me to a pulp or anything, but there were several incidents of him hitting me and choking me. One resulted in a moderate injury, I had a jaw contusion that make it so I couldn’t open my mouth more than a centimeter for a whole month. It literally would not open it was so bizarre but it was a direct result of him punching me in the jaw. 

Anyway. We’ve stopped talking. And I’ve since found out he’s spreading nasty rumors about me to his friends, saying I was the abusive one and literally calling himself a hostage in our relationship. So I took one of the more tame videos I had secretly recorded of him physically hitting me that included his face and I uploaded it as a reel and posted it onto a burner instagram. I then added the friends I knew he had told this bullshit to. I have video/audio of him sexually assaulting me too but i decided that was too much for instagram. 

He has called me 5 times today, pissed off and trying to convince me how wrong I am for doing that, trying to convince me to take it down. Threatening to tell them MY secrets as if it matters at all in the context. I don’t care. He shouldn’t have spread those rumors about me. Now he’s threatening to get a restraining order, I explained to him that those only are granted in situations where the victim has reasonable fear of bodily harm(I know this because I have applied for two restraining orders in my life and received one). He has no reason to fear bodily harm and he knows that. 

So then he threatened to get a GAG ORDER on me. I’m not even kidding. This man in his 30’s thinks that he can ask the court to tell me to shut up and they’ll just listen and obey him and make me indefinitely shut up. Meanwhile the post he would be disputing which would be shown in court is a video of him literally hitting me in the head like 10 times. With his face and voice in it. Yeah. And he thinks taking ME to court is going to go well for him. I can’t even believe what I’m typing right now the audacity is through the roof. I would love to show up to restraining order court with 10 years worth of evidence of him physically and sexually abusing me and hear him explain to the judge why HE should be protected from me.

18518,1guaebr,post,I went mute and unintentionally allowed my Fiancé(25M) to ejaculate on my(25F) bottom while I was asleep in bed with our baby?,"(Throwaway account im using)I’m a SAHM of a 4month old. And have a one way ticket to go see my mom with my baby…  He came home from his night shift job, we had been arguing for a while about some minor stuff but it’s enough that I have absolutely no sexual attraction to him right lately. 

I woke up to the blanket and the bed shaking aggressively… I was half asleep so I wasn’t even fully there yet. in disbelief, I asked him if he’s doing what I thought he was doing. He said yes. Then he proceeds to pull my panties down and I groaned in reaction.. 

as I was waking up more, it dawned on me  that this was really happening and he actually is masturbating on the bed behind me and the baby.. he didn’t even ask me if I’m ok with this which I’m not. Then he pulls my panties lower and finishes on my bottom. 

We’ve had discussions about requiring consent for things in the past. I’m not sure why he thought this was the right thing to do.  It I guess I shouldn’t be surprised because the other day he said he doesn’t need consent to kiss me when I’d rejected kissing him because I was mad that he 
1. Stared at other women in public on our date and won’t take accountability for continuing to do this behavior.
2. Never helps with the baby for No longer than a half hour some days. Usually less if the baby cries..
3. He keeps joking that I’m long distance cheating with my childhood friends I literally just got back in contact with.

I booked the plane ticket last week after th last time he ruined our date. He been trying to gas light me and love bomb me since that moment. He knows I saw.

I stuttered when i saw him do it and he turned from her to me and looked worried. Ever since he’s been sucking up.

I don’t think it occurred to him that my cooperation was not silent consent. When I have time to process things, it’s easier to talk about them later. 

he wiped the cum off after. I feel gross and used and like I’ve been reduced to a live in maid and sex object. And I can’t believe he did it near our baby girl

Edit: for those concerned about my baby’s safety, my daughter will not under any circumstances, allow herself to sleep in her bassinet.. I’ve tried from day one so i practice all the safety precautions while bed sharing. And I don’t move in my sleep at all. So I’m not worried about rolling onto her. Plus I still sleep in that C position just in case. ","I went mute and unintentionally allowed my Fiancé(25M) to ejaculate on my(25F) bottom while I was asleep in bed with our baby? (Throwaway account im using)I’m a SAHM of a 4month old. And have a one way ticket to go see my mom with my baby…  He came home from his night shift job, we had been arguing for a while about some minor stuff but it’s enough that I have absolutely no sexual attraction to him right lately. 

I woke up to the blanket and the bed shaking aggressively… I was half asleep so I wasn’t even fully there yet. in disbelief, I asked him if he’s doing what I thought he was doing. He said yes. Then he proceeds to pull my panties down and I groaned in reaction.. 

as I was waking up more, it dawned on me  that this was really happening and he actually is masturbating on the bed behind me and the baby.. he didn’t even ask me if I’m ok with this which I’m not. Then he pulls my panties lower and finishes on my bottom. 

We’ve had discussions about requiring consent for things in the past. I’m not sure why he thought this was the right thing to do.  It I guess I shouldn’t be surprised because the other day he said he doesn’t need consent to kiss me when I’d rejected kissing him because I was mad that he 
1. Stared at other women in public on our date and won’t take accountability for continuing to do this behavior.
2. Never helps with the baby for No longer than a half hour some days. Usually less if the baby cries..
3. He keeps joking that I’m long distance cheating with my childhood friends I literally just got back in contact with.

I booked the plane ticket last week after th last time he ruined our date. He been trying to gas light me and love bomb me since that moment. He knows I saw.

I stuttered when i saw him do it and he turned from her to me and looked worried. Ever since he’s been sucking up.

18519,1gtjb5b,post,A good friend  of mine has a tendency to fall victim: Am I wrong to think this way?,"Trigger warning: rape

I have a close friend who confided in me that she was sexually assaulted in the past. I care deeply about her, but sometimes I wonder if my concern for her is excessive. One of the things that worries me is the way she talks about her preferences regarding men, which, to me, seem like they could expose her to further trauma.

She says she prefers a “more traditional” approach to relationships, where the man has the final say on everything and essentially makes decisions for the woman. (Personally, I strongly oppose this because I grew up in a household exactly like that.) The way she describes the type of man she wants sounds very much like an abusive partner—or at least someone with the potential to be one: a man who would tell her whether or not she should pursue a career, control her finances, and constantly decide where she should go.

Additionally, she frequently talks about how much she enjoys being hit (in a sexual context), and knowing her background, this makes me deeply uncomfortable—as if she’s leaving herself open to the possibility of being assaulted again.

The question is: Should I even respond to this? It feels like these are her personal preferences, and I worry I’ll come across as rude or intrusive if I tell her that I’m concerned. Maybe I’m overreacting.

As part of my job, I work with survivors of sexual assault, and I wonder if I’m projecting what I’ve seen in other victims onto her. What do you think? Is this just a phase? Is this something I should bring up with her and address, or is it none of my business?","A good friend  of mine has a tendency to fall victim: Am I wrong to think this way? Trigger warning: rape

18521,1gscsiw,post,I secretly hate my mom.,"This is something i’ve just come to realise and I do not know how to feel about it…

She had me when she was 17 in high school and she pretty much made it known my entire life that she hates me and that I “ruined her life”. She would always tell me that I was a mistake and yes the whole family would laugh about it and just brush it off but you could tell that she meant it from the bottom of her heart and that HURT.

We’ve pretty much never had a solid relationship. My dad passed away when I was 9. She had another baby and got married. I’ve been staying with my grandmother as a child…
When she got married, she left me behind and went to stay with her husband and her new child. Our relationship was non existent at this point. The only time she would come to see me  is to discipline me. She would hit me with everything and anything near her, she would use belts, shoes, a thick plastic pipe and a tree branch sometimes. It’s like every time she needed a break from her life with her husband, she’d come take out all her stress on me.

I was TERRIFIED of her, I remember this one time when I needed stationary for school, I was in the 5th Grade, I saved up all of my lunch money for weeks until i finally gathered the courage to ask her to take me to the shops after work i just wanted to get school supplies with my own money. She bit my head off telling me how she’s busy she doesn’t have time for me and that im disturbing her. I later attempted to walk to the shops( it was really far and not safe at all but i was a child and i didn’t like borrowing stationary from other kids everyday anymore, it was kind of embarrassing), Only for my grandmother to find me while on my way, she yelled at me for walking alone and it’s getting late but she quickly took me to the shops… My Grandmother told my mom what happened and it’s like she’d awakened something in her, she came straight to me where she beat me with a belt till i had marks on my skin…I just couldn’t understand her anger, i asked her first. I think it actually felt like she hates me, i could see it in her eyes.

So this man that she’s married to literally doesn’t like her. They’re practically roommates.
Everytime, ever since she got married she wants to to prove myself to him. I was literally a golden child, i made no mistakes, then one day, i was 12, she tells me that her husband and she spoke and they decided that i must go stay with them. It was like “ Congratulations you’ve been a good child and your reward is finally staying with your own mother, be grateful” And i stayed with them for 3 years, I was the most perfect child, i cooked and cleaned for everyone everyday, the only thing i did was homework and studying ONLY… Then This one time i was in the 9th grade ,I was in my adolescent stage ( it only lasted 3 months honestly) Where i just discovered alcohol and smoking and bad friends and boys. I went to a party, My curfew was 5pm and i didn’t make it back home in time. I arrived at 6pm and yes i was drunk. I’m not afraid to admit my mistakes and take accountability for them. I did that and the only thing i was saying to her that time was that i’m sorry i’m wrong this will never happen again.
She did not hear a thing. She made me pack my clothes in Black refuse bags and carry them and she kicked me out. It was giving the trash taking itself out. I walked to my grandmothers, and not to compare but i feel like she literally treated me like the child i was at that time. She reprimanded me and took my phone away and basically i had to earn her trust back. LIKE A NORMAL PARENT WOULD.
Regardless of the mistake i made, my mother’s first reaction to my very first mistake in her house was to chase me away.
That NEVER sat well with me. I’m someone who gets bored very quickly so, i never really went to parties or anything after that , everything was normal after that, i changed friends and everything. I worked extra hard to “prove myself” to my mother that im worthy of basically being her child… Until about a year passed and i realised that i was tired and i actually wanted to be where im wanted.
So i was content with staying with my grandmother.
My mom saw how happy i was, then she asked me to come back to stay with her again, and i said no, then she said she wasn’t asking she was telling me. i told her that i do not like how im being tossed around like a dog, i want to stay in one place, she forced me to stay with her. 
I was so miserable, back to being the perfect golden child who can’t even breathe incorrectly…

Years passed and i finished high school and i finally had a sit down conversation with her where i told her how much she has hurt me, that was the first time i think she listened to anything i said and she actually apologised…
Girl she was fooling me.
It came up later that she feels like i’ve wronged her by just being born.

In 2019 I was sexually assaulted and it resulted in a pregnancy, i only found about the pregnancy in january of 2020. I was starting university in a few weeks and i chose to get an abortion. It was a very difficult time in my life i was so emotionally attached to the fetus and it hurt losing a baby but i just bottled up my feelings and focused on school.
In march 2020 there was lockdown so i had to go back home for isolation due to covid. I stayed home for 5 months and i was crying myself to sleep every single night because of what happened to me and i had feelings of guilt because ive aborted a baby and im a christian. I could not even pray, i was embarrassed. 
Anyway i figured i can’t keep it to myself anymore and i decided to confide in my mother, she listened and was so supportive at first.
Then i think about a week after i told her she started using it against me and victim blaming me and then i remember crying thinking why would she do that. Then i remembered that no man that’s how she’s always been.
I left home 2 weeks after that and went back to school and i told her that she’s ruined it for us, i will never ever tell her anything ever again about me because she just used this against me.

Then there is her abusive husband that she forced me to start calling him dad.
That just disgusting, i feel like the stepfather needs his own post but , he literally never liked me, he always made it known and because im my moms child outside of marriage, i had to prove my self to him that basically im worth anything. he’s actually disgusting to me..

You know there is so much more that happened. Im 24 now and yes i do go to therapy. I think there is a lot of trauma that i’ve accumulated and i don’t know how to get rid of it… I can talk about it yes, i’ve moved past some of the things but i think im struggling to forget about it.
If you hurt me i can forgive you but i cannot just forget that you hurt me.
I feel like im basically forced to keep her in my life forever because “She’s my mom” but honestly, why would i want to keep someone like that in my life, isn’t that self sabotage. 

I want to atleast like her but honestly everytime i see her i think of all the things she’s done and said to me . Which means im now very pretentious towards her and now i secretly hate her.

18523,1gpx8q1,post,I just can't anymore,"TW suicide, potentially sexual issues. 

So I was with this person for eight years. She went from living as a man to transitioning to being a woman during that time. Also, any transphobic comments will be reported. That wasn't the reason we broke up. 

Also, this past December, 2 years after we broke up for good, she ended her life. So while I have moments where I wish that I directly caused it, at the end of the day, I did care about her and I would have prevented it if I was there. I'd have gotten her help if I was there. I'd have did CPR if I was there. I would have fucking done something because I don't think she deserved to die. 

My ex was interesting. If she didn't get what she wanted from me she'd yell, throw hissie fits - fuck she even got out of my car under a freeway underpass because I wouldn't drive to buy her liquor. I understand that there were plenty of ways that I failed her too, but in the beginning of our relationship I was wild myself and did everything in my power to heal. Oddly enough, I'm more honest, direct, confident and myself outside of that relationship. I had some deceptive behaviors (not cheating) and I worked them out during the course of that relationship. I lied to her about some shit I didn't need to. After we took a break, I went to therapy, continued for a while until work got super busy. I tried to make time at least once a month or so. And now I can't afford it. But I'm working on it. 

There are so many things that rubbed me wrong. Her pushing me into an open relationship (maybe I owed that to her). Her screaming at me anytime she didn't get something she wanted, unfortunately sex was included in this. After she died I started going back to some of these memories and can't get them out of my head. 

It started with relentless begging, but got up to insults, and her touching me in that manner anyway. The last time we had sex was a few days after we broke up. She would beg, plead, cry, she hugged me even. Told me ""say good bye to (dead name) one last time"". I started fake crying because I thought that would get her to stop. But it didn't. After we had sex I thought that was that. I said something that pissed her off and the interaction stopped. 

The next day she was glad if happened because it showed her how incompatible we were (she was sober when she said this shit). A few weeks later she in tears, accused me of taking advantage of her when she was drunk. And my dumbass apologized. Why did I apologize?! 😭 Why everytime I see her fucking face in my head do I cringe? I don't want to say the word, I really don't. Because I've been sexually assaulted before. I fucking healed from that shit and now I have reoccurring nightmares of the people before her. This happened years ago and it's like my mind wants to go back to it yet again. I can't do that anymore. It nearly killed what light I had back then. I can't do this again now. She's in those nightmares. Her fucking face makes me so angry. I get these flashes where I feel her touching me and I feel sick. I feel like I want to fucking scream all the time. I was with her for eight years. I thought she loved me..despite everything I thought she loved me. I understand I lied 6 years before this, but did she have to do that?

Did I owe her sex no matter what? I'm starting to gather that accountability isn't about being someone's slave for the rest of your life; while you put your needs on the back burner, if they take you back, they should commit to not harming you back. They should talk about their feelings, talk to you when they're feeling triggered and definitely involved outside help that way they don't feel like you're the only person that they have to talk to about it. And obviously I owed her the truth. I owed her being honest moving forward. But did I owe her sex on demand? Did I owe her an open relationship? Did I owe her never being allowed to say no to anything ever again? Did I owe her being a verbal punching bag? I get some yelling is going to be involved, but does it need to be daily? Anyway, feel free to answer those questions if you want. I just needed to vent. So thanks! 🫂❤️","I just can't anymore TW suicide, potentially sexual issues. 

So I was with this person for eight years. She went from living as a man to transitioning to being a woman during that time. Also, any transphobic comments will be reported. That wasn't the reason we broke up. 

Also, this past December, 2 years after we broke up for good, she ended her life. So while I have moments where I wish that I directly caused it, at the end of the day, I did care about her and I would have prevented it if I was there. I'd have gotten her help if I was there. I'd have did CPR if I was there. I would have fucking done something because I don't think she deserved to die. 

My ex was interesting. If she didn't get what she wanted from me she'd yell, throw hissie fits - fuck she even got out of my car under a freeway underpass because I wouldn't drive to buy her liquor. I understand that there were plenty of ways that I failed her too, but in the beginning of our relationship I was wild myself and did everything in my power to heal. Oddly enough, I'm more honest, direct, confident and myself outside of that relationship. I had some deceptive behaviors (not cheating) and I worked them out during the course of that relationship. I lied to her about some shit I didn't need to. After we took a break, I went to therapy, continued for a while until work got super busy. I tried to make time at least once a month or so. And now I can't afford it. But I'm working on it. 

There are so many things that rubbed me wrong. Her pushing me into an open relationship (maybe I owed that to her). Her screaming at me anytime she didn't get something she wanted, unfortunately sex was included in this. After she died I started going back to some of these memories and can't get them out of my head. 

It started with relentless begging, but got up to insults, and her touching me in that manner anyway. The last time we had sex was a few days after we broke up. She would beg, plead, cry, she hugged me even. Told me ""say good bye to (dead name) one last time"". I started fake crying because I thought that would get her to stop. But it didn't. After we had sex I thought that was that. I said something that pissed her off and the interaction stopped. 

The next day she was glad if happened because it showed her how incompatible we were (she was sober when she said this shit). A few weeks later she in tears, accused me of taking advantage of her when she was drunk. And my dumbass apologized. Why did I apologize?! 😭 Why everytime I see her fucking face in my head do I cringe? I don't want to say the word, I really don't. Because I've been sexually assaulted before. I fucking healed from that shit and now I have reoccurring nightmares of the people before her. This happened years ago and it's like my mind wants to go back to it yet again. I can't do that anymore. It nearly killed what light I had back then. I can't do this again now. She's in those nightmares. Her fucking face makes me so angry. I get these flashes where I feel her touching me and I feel sick. I feel like I want to fucking scream all the time. I was with her for eight years.

18524,1gp6l1p,post,I reported my best friend to the police,"So there is a backstory to this but I am going to keep it brief.

I (36F) have been friends with my best friend (38M) who I will call Joel since we were teenagers. I went him when in college (UK college ages can start at 16) through shared interests in music, manga and video games. I regularly hung out at his place with other friends. I became friendly with his parents and his older brother who I will call Max. Max would make inappropriate comments about my boobs size because they are big. I shrugged it off because I developed early and unfortunately became used to receiving these remarks.

When I was 17 years old and Max was 23 years old, he attempted to rape me. I had arranged to meet Joel after class in College (we are in the UK) and he was running late. His brother was off work so he let me in and I sat on one side of the couch, it was a 4 seater and he was on the other side. There was a DVD box set of my favourite TV show, we talked about it and before we know it, he is moving closer and closer to me. I moved to sit on the arm of the couch, when Max grabbed me by the waist, tried put me on his knee for a make out session. I don’t know what came over me but I freaked out, I get off him and before I know it, he is grabbing me and not letting me go, saying I played hard to get. He was behind me, trying to restrain me and grabbing my breasts when I elbowed him in the crotch and ran out. 

I told Joel that his brother made a pass at me. He originally took his brother’s side, claiming I was a tease till our whole friend group, sided with me then told him off and aired their concerns. Eventually it became a running joke to Joel that I elbowed his brother in the groin. 

Years later, I am in therapy for what my ex/child’s dad did to me, (that’s another story). I break down to the therapist about some of the comments on my body and mentioned the comments that lead up to the time Max tried to grab me and kiss me. The therapist said that what Max was attempting was sexual assault. I had broken contact with Joel because his new girlfriend claimed that girls like me having big boobs was my consent to revenge porn. (That was a fun argument at our mutual friend’s birthday.) My now husband who has been a rock to me  and therapist told me to give Joel a chance since he is one of my oldest friends. 

I meet up with Joel without his insensitive idiot girlfriend and my husband. We talked about what the gf said, why I was pissed off and what I talked about in therapy. I told him that I originally went to therapy for the revenge porn but in one of the sessions, I discussed what Max did to me, at 17.

I told him that his older brother, doing that was scary, inappropriate and I was a virgin at the time when he pulled that stunt. He listened and didn’t crack any jokes. I don’t know what was going on in his mind but he dropped this bombshell.

“I slept with a 15 year old girl and took her virginity. I’m sorry.”


I was shocked, without thinking I asked for more information. It was around the time, I was pregnant and was busy preparing for my child’s birth so I was not socialising. He met this girl at comic con, in cosplay. He took her for drinks - alcoholic in bars where the legal age to drink in the UK is 18. He was 27 at the time and she was 15. He mentioned that they shared nudes and made sex videos. He still has them. I listened, but I was upset and angry deep down. He apologised cos of what his brother did to me and because I let him around my son. My son called him uncle Joel. We finished our chat and I go home. 


When I got home, I waited to put my son to bed then I called the police and let them know. I called 101 number and told them everything I knew. He was living at his mum’s at the time after falling out with a flatmate so I gave her address. He still has the girl as a FB friend. 

He was my best friend but I don’t know him anymore and I am beginning to think that I never truly knew him. They said that they will investigate it and are taking it seriously. My husband was horrified when I told him. I asked our mutual friends if they knew about it and they said yes. Only one of them dropped him at the time, only cos the girl called her a “bunny boiler” and Joel ignorantly took her side. This was before finding out her age. She gave their friendship another chance when he sheepishly crawled back, depressed cos the girl dumped him for a boy her own age. I unadded Joel from Facebook and blocked his number and socials. 

I don’t know if the police have knocked on his door yet but something tells me that I will find out soon enough. ","I reported my best friend to the police So there is a backstory to this but I am going to keep it brief.

18525,1gok4di,post,Ex kept trying to touch me after I said no,"I have never publicly told anyone this, but I wanted some opinions on this. 

My now ex gf and I had just finished having sex. During sex, I ended up catching a cramp because I had played basketball for hours that day and couldn’t really finish off. I was in too tired to continue so we just stopped. I apologized to her and we continued to watch a movie in the basement. 

After a fee minutes, she started to grab my crotch and groin. I politely told her to stop a few times and even moved her hand out of the way. Every time I moved her hand it seemed like she would try even harder to grab my d***. This went on for like 10 minutes and It was so awkward and uncomfortable for me especially since I had a situation like that happen to me back in 2019, where I was taken advantage of and sexually assaulted by a girl. It made me feel super weird especially since I trustee her enough to tell her that story too. The fact that she would try doing something like that just brought back memories of my similar experience. 

Later that night I kind of brushed it off and she kept apologizing saying she didn’t mean it. I told her not to worry about it because I wanted to avoid any confrontation and uncomfortable conversations revisiting my past. I just don’t like talking about it because it was very traumatic for me. 

Now that we are no longer together, I have been thinking about it a lot more because I realized that ever since that moment, out relationship kind of shifted and we started to grow apart emotionally. We ended up breaking up because I was unfaithful to her which I owned up to and admitted but in hindsight I am just now realizing how much that moment changed my perception of her and kind of changed the trajectory of our relationship. 

Has this happened to anyone? Am I overthinking this? Just doing a lot of reflecting rn. ","Ex kept trying to touch me after I said no I have never publicly told anyone this, but I wanted some opinions on this.

18526,1gnrzqk,post,She ruined his life...,"Throwaway account, for obvious reasons (Originally written this on January 25, 2023 was meaning to share)

This still sickens me 5 1/2+ years later.

Edit: I need to also mention that I originally DID believe her as I **DIDN'T** know who the guy was at first who she was referring to, but after his name was out, I knew she was full of it, Also to clarify all of us were minors, **INCLUDING** ""*Steven*""

So I (22F) have an ex-best friend (21F) who we will call Ellie (not her real name), 

This all takes place back in 2018, Sophomore year of high school, When my former best friend *Ellie* (21F) she accused one of my best guy friends who we will call *Steven* (21M) (not his real name, to protect his privacy) of rape. My current and one of my closest best friends who we will call *Violet* (21F) (not her real name for privacy reasons) knows what really happened. So more backstory, *Ellie* and *Steven* started dating back in the beginning of sophomore year. *Ellie* and I weren’t super close at that time but a few months after the whole “rape” occurred she started talking to me. We got super close over the year of getting to know one another, I even told her about how I was sexually assaulted back in middle school, (don't worry about it now as the assaulter is in jail constantly). I being young and dumb never really paid it no thought on why she started talking to me, as I am slow at times to know about things. On the other hand *Violet* and I have been best friends since the 6th grade. When *Ellie* started to hang out with me more so did *Violet*, *Violet* was friends with *Ellie* from way back when. One day I noticed that my friend *Steven* was no longer in my English class.

Keep in mind this was **wayyyy** before Covid-19, so Covid wasn’t the case on why he wasn’t at school. I asked around and then found out that I was being used as a shield, I was popular yet not popular back in high school, a lot of people knew me because of my twin-sister *Beverly* (again not the real name, to protect my family obviously, and *Beverly* has nothing to do with the whole situation), my sister is one of the kindest people I know and she didn't let popularity get to her head, and as soon as *Ellie* found out I was related to her she started hanging out with and around me, I genuinely didn't mind as I was open to making new friends and am an introvert. Shortly after she started hanging out with *Violet* and I, that’s when rumors started going around. People were pushing me away like I had a contagious disease or something. 

*Violet* pulled me aside one day and told me what was being said. I confronted *Ellie* about it. Only to be lied to, at that very moment I distanced myself from *Ellie*. To this day November 9, 2024 I still am avoiding her. Last I heard she’s going around asking why her friends aren’t talking to her anymore, plus she also managed to get a boyfriend, I just hope he is aware of her past and how she ruined an innocent mans life... not just any man nor any life but my best guy friends life

I’m not one to write about these types of things, but it's been on my mind A LOT lately, I feel guilt for carrying the truth all these years, I just hope my guy best friend is doing a lot better today

18527,1gnot0z,post,My mom OD’d Last Night,"
She’s alive. My dad gave her CPR until the paramedics arrived with Norcan. She’s been a lousy alcoholic my whole life. A fucking meth head. A pill popper. Just about anything you can imagine. But I guess doing even harder drugs now? I’m 39F and just so goddamn tired of this. 


I’m lost. I’m fucking 39 and feel like a small abused child. Their partying lifestyle put me on the back burner. I was sexually assaulted over and over by an adult relative while they fucking partied. We lived in a trailer with no electricity of phone for over 3 years 9-12 years old. I had a single pair of underwear I used to hand wash in the sink. I remember my mom letting me, as a 12 yo, drive our car to our closest neighbor (think country and dirt roads) to buy her crank for her before getting in the school bus and going to the 6th grade.

It’s like the trauma that just fucking keeps on giving. 

Somehow, I, ended up fairly well adjusted. I own my own home, have a college degree (only one in my family and it’s paid for by scholarships) run two of my own companies. Have 2 beautiful children. We are always scraping by but we are making it. And for that I am grateful. But I look at my little daughter (who looks looks identical to me as a child) and sometime I feel so much hurt because I realize my mother was looking at the same thing while choosing drugs and partying. Also, the adult family member that sexually assaulted me was my oldest brother by 12 years. He’s still her baby boy.

18528,1gmqbja,post,"I want to go no contact with my parents, but I don’t.","It’s not like I’d get much, my parents are very very well off but they also had 7 children and at this point a dozen grandchildren. 

I feel like a grave robber or at the very least extremely dishonest and not living my truth/best life by cutting ties. 

I don’t want to make this post too long, but I could talk about my parents and all the different ways they wronged myself along with all my siblings. 

My parents aren’t addicts, they didn’t physically abuse….the second half of their kids, housing and food was always stable, we were rewarded for good deeds and good grades, taught us morals, and to this day they do everything they can to help their kids. My dad is in his 70’s and he went out of state to put my sisters sprinkler system together. If she can (or frankly she’s allowed) my mother would spend weeks helping the new mother of her grandchild. 

Whats the problem they sound great right? I must be a horrible child wanting nothing to do with them and yet “pulling a long con”. 

One act doesn’t decide who you are. All of them do. Each act has a different cost, and a different reward. My parents give to charity, they serve others whenever possible, on the outside they are so pleasant. 

And then I tell you my mother gave my sister appetite suppressant gum in middle school because she was a bit bigger. I tell you my dad was more prone to beating his kids before he chilled out. I tell you my mother allowed her brother who sexually assaulted my aunts when they were kids to be around me, even said “its okay I’m here” when he asked me to sit on his lap once. I tell you that I was told by my mother at 13 that over the years my father tried to divorce her several times effectively pinning me against him for years. I tell you I was legally an adult, 19, when they stripped me of all my belongings and kept me in their house for 3 months because I simply didn’t want to be in the cult they raised me in. I tell you that my own mother said I should’ve died as a baby if I was going to leave. 

Thats only the tip of the iceberg. You might look at some of that and say it’s not as bad as it could be and you are right. My parents could have been so much worse. You might look at some of that and say “I would have cut ties for less”. I don’t remember a lot of my life because of them, regardless. My sister’s (the one given the suppressant gum to chew at school) child is learning they may be queer and its completely under wraps from my parents because my sister is afraid of them. 

I still had hope for my parents and who I thought they were growing up. Even after 2016 when they were delighted over the election results I was scared of them seeing more of their true self come out but I had hope as it became clearer and clearer who cared about the country and had cognitive abilities. Turns out nope. They did the same thing they did 8 years ago. 

And you know why? Because they are already millionaires. I escaped the tyranny of the family home just for my parents to continue to control me and my body and what I do with it with their vote. They have chosen themselves but think their children should have a relationship with them because the good they do “offsets the bad”. 

My parents, as one last final jab at their character, have ALWAYS used financial assistance against their children. “If you don’t xyz we won’t pay for your wedding/help with your down payment/keep you on the insurance”. I remember them threatening college funds and such as a child, saying how we’ll end up on the street without them. They drilled the fear of failure into all of us if we didn’t make enough money to take care of ourselves. 

My parents are not good people. At best they are riding the line. If I knew I would never need their money ever again I would cut them off in an instant. But looking at the economy, my future, all of it, I’m going to need whatever they decide to give me when they go. But they are petty and will hold grudges. So if i cut them out now they would absolutely write me out completely or put most of their life savings into the only child that hasn’t left their cult. 

I don’t WANT to come over for Christmases or any event. I can’t walk into their home without taking my anxiety medication and even then I can’t take being in that house or around my parents for more than 2 hours before I need to leave. I don’t want to acknowledge them at all for my mental health, and overall human growth. But I have to if I hope to be remotely comfortable in this economy in 15-20 years. Im more afraid of my father dying first because he has always been the more level headed one in trying to provide for us even if he does use financial assistance threats on me still to this day. My mother has far less compassion for us and I wouldn’t put it past her to update his or her will after his passing. 

So there you have it. I want my parents to pass as quickly as possible so I don’t have to keep pretending my trauma doesn’t exist, so my nieces and nephews can figure out who they are without judgement, and so I maybe have a fighting chance in the world they modeled for me.  I’ve been pretending I give a shit about them for 12 years now and I can promise you I will not cry when I get the call in 20 more years. ","I want to go no contact with my parents, but I don’t. It’s not like I’d get much, my parents are very very well off but they also had 7 children and at this point a dozen grandchildren. 

I feel like a grave robber or at the very least extremely dishonest and not living my truth/best life by cutting ties. 

I don’t want to make this post too long, but I could talk about my parents and all the different ways they wronged myself along with all my siblings. 

My parents aren’t addicts, they didn’t physically abuse….the second half of their kids, housing and food was always stable, we were rewarded for good deeds and good grades, taught us morals, and to this day they do everything they can to help their kids. My dad is in his 70’s and he went out of state to put my sisters sprinkler system together. If she can (or frankly she’s allowed) my mother would spend weeks helping the new mother of her grandchild. 

Whats the problem they sound great right? I must be a horrible child wanting nothing to do with them and yet “pulling a long con”. 

One act doesn’t decide who you are. All of them do. Each act has a different cost, and a different reward. My parents give to charity, they serve others whenever possible, on the outside they are so pleasant. 

And then I tell you my mother gave my sister appetite suppressant gum in middle school because she was a bit bigger. I tell you my dad was more prone to beating his kids before he chilled out. I tell you my mother allowed her brother who sexually assaulted my aunts when they were kids to be around me, even said “its okay I’m here” when he asked me to sit on his lap once. I tell you that I was told by my mother at 13 that over the years my father tried to divorce her several times effectively pinning me against him for years. I tell you I was legally an adult, 19, when they stripped me of all my belongings and kept me in their house for 3 months because I simply didn’t want to be in the cult they raised me in. I tell you that my own mother said I should’ve died as a baby if I was going to leave. 

Thats only the tip of the iceberg. You might look at some of that and say it’s not as bad as it could be and you are right. My parents could have been so much worse. You might look at some of that and say “I would have cut ties for less”. I don’t remember a lot of my life because of them, regardless. My sister’s (the one given the suppressant gum to chew at school) child is learning they may be queer and its completely under wraps from my parents because my sister is afraid of them. 

I still had hope for my parents and who I thought they were growing up. Even after 2016 when they were delighted over the election results I was scared of them seeing more of their true self come out but I had hope as it became clearer and clearer who cared about the country and had cognitive abilities. Turns out nope. They did the same thing they did 8 years ago. 

And you know why? Because they are already millionaires. I escaped the tyranny of the family home just for my parents to continue to control me and my body and what I do with it with their vote. They have chosen themselves but think their children should have a relationship with them because the good they do “offsets the bad”.

Am a 20 year old male. Was SA'd overseas as a child by a relative during a family trip. This stunted my development of my social skills as I become more quiet after the incident. I became more monotone and poor in expressing facial emotions when speaking.

Throughout my schooling years I was heavily bullied due to the way I speak making me more reserved. And then I struggle as a functioning adult because of this, failing in job interviews, failing in dating, having a social college life etc.

I work in multiple minimum wage jobs filled with young men and women who psychologically bully me. They say I'm like a serial killer or a robot and that creeps them out, uncanny valley vibes and avoid talking to me. Spread mean gossip about me like I'm mentally challenged.

In college people ignored me icebreakers and i struggled with a social life or groupwork there. I did have some dates but they lose interest once i start opening my mouth (i don't say anything creepy, it's just the way i say it).

I can't talk about this without redditors thinking I'm intentionally being creepy towards people or assuming I am an lncel.

And I cant be accepted in society or be a functional adult because of one incident. I don't think i can advance in life. Why am I still getting punished?","Being abused as a child ruined my social skills. I can't talk properly and that creeps people out. Why am I still getting punished? TW: SA

18534,1i4hza4,post,I don't know what to feel ,"I don't know what to do

I genuinely have no one in my life other than my siblings and I can't trust any of them. My family is so dysfunctional but they are genuinely the only people I have to talk to in this world but they're always busy or gone. 

I tried going back to school but I can't do so without the assistance of my parents, but they let every change to re-enroll me just pass by. I've never had any friends and I know that if I went back I still wouldn't have any, but I guess I'd have some social interaction which is better than what I do now. Going outside is an accomplishment on its own which is terrible for anyone but especially someone at my stage in life

I did also have a job but for reasons I don't want to get into, I had to quit and I can't return because I don't have a state issued ID. I also need my parent's assistance for that, but they never want to seem to help me, and they always tell me that money is tight but they somehow wind up with 40$ for cigarettes, snacks, drinks, alcohol, or whatever.

They call me lazy because I don't go out and I sleep a lot to pass the time because I have no one, but I do everything they tell/ask me to and then some. They always seem appreciative in the moment but I know it's an act because one way or another I always find out how the really feel. Ex: dad ranting to the neighbors about how he has a lazy ass kid because I didn't do the dishes but we have no dish soap, and this is after he went to the store but instead he chose to buy snacks and drinks for him to eat with our mom while. On top of that we have no food. I would have even washed the dishes with body wash but I don't even have that because I rely on them but they can't afford it. 

They always use my lonliness against me whenever they feel that it's time to come down on me. My dad even found out about my sh and while he and my siblings were sitting in a circle he that ""when it's time to get real people want to hurt themselves"" even though that's not at all why I was doing it. Yet when I uncharacteristically decided to stand up for myself, he told me that pays the bills so he can say whatever he feels like. 

My mom is a doormat, unfortunately, and she just agrees with whatever he says for the sake of avoiding hostility, and she let's everything go by because she doesn't feel like dealing with it, and while I understand that she has her own mental and emotional issues it does hurt to be cast aside for whatever my dad feels is right whenever he's on one of his power trips. 

My siblings aren't much better either. All of them show narcissistic traits.
 
Sibling #1(oldest in home): Manipulative, narcissistic, vain. One of those people who tries to use your insecurities against you to make you submit to them and if you don't they make your life hell to make themselves feel better. They've also sa'ed me, but this was when we were kids, but it's still something that lingers in the back of my mind--both myself and the youngest attempted to tell our mother about it when we were younger, but she just said that it was probably an accident and we haven't had the courage to speak up about it since and neither she nor my father would believe us.

Sibling #2: Extremely violent when angered and narcissistic. They have extreme anger issues to the point that they punch floors, walls, chairs, and they are also abusive to our pets. They have also assaulted me physically when angry and sa when we were kids. They're also introverted and very misogynistic, a woman can't we right and women can't be victims in their eyes and I think they got this ideology from our father because he holds those same beliefs. 

Sibling #3: Liar, thief, manipulator, narcissistic. They have so many issues that I don't even know where to begin. 
They biggest this is that they steal things, in home and outside. They steal anything that they can get their hands on like: money, food, my underwear (ik), hygiene products, and that's just in our house because they also steal from malls and stores. 

They also have the tendency to lie and act out and it's like they're allergic to the word no because every time someone says it to them they lose their minds. I'm talking screaming, yelling, breaking things, and burning their bridges. They just recently ran away for a few days after getting into a screaming match this our father in which they both said so many unacceptable things to each other. They tore our room apart while collecting their things and throwing them into a trash bag and leaving. This waspir dad made an assumption and he screamed at yelled at them in our neighbor's home and did everything he could to embarrass them. Even after he got the full story from them he refused to believe it and everything just became a dumpster fire after they both came home. 

They manipulate our mom into forgiving them with tears an empty promises no matter how many times they put her in situations, which are sometimes life threatening. And our mom lets it happen because she wants us all to be one big happy family.

In every situation they are miraculously the victims and everything bad that happens to them is always someone else's fault, even if they got themselves in a predicament. Every time they get themselves into am issue their ""friend's"" names always come up and they are always thrown under the bus to savey siblings' skin.


If I went on any more this would be a novel so I guess I'll just stop it here, but I thought I'd give some insight so whoever is reading this can see why I can't really ride my family, despite them being the only people I have. I've attempted to better myself in every aspect that is under my control but nothing seems to work because I couldn't seem to fit in or find individuals like myself despite those efforts. I do my best to be a decent person not even in hopes that I'll benefit from it, but because I know what it feels like to be nothing.

Minsan pa pag nanonood ako sa sala tas andun sya. Sasabay pa yan sya magpapatugtog pa sa phone nya. Like hello? Nanonood ako tas naka full volume pa yang cellphone mo nag sosoundtrip ka? Wala ka bang earphones? Ni pinag kainan nya tatambak nya lang sa lababo. Tas pag ubos na tubig sa ref nilalagay nya pa talaga kahit walang laman. Like bruh di mo to bahay para umasta ka ng ganyan. Di ka ba nahihiya ikaw na nga nakikitira ganyan pa ugali mo. Wala ka man lang pagkukusa. Pabigat ka na nga batugan ka pa. 

Kaya nakakawalang gana talaga tulungan nga ganyang kamag anak. Ang kapal ng mukha.",1,0,2025-01-18 20:22,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1i4ggnv/kamag_anak_kong_makapal_ang_mukha/,Neutral

July 2022 I found out my boyfriend for 10 years /husband for 6 years 29M was cheating on me with an older co-worker 33F ( typical hair colored claiming to be religious /dancer/photographer etc) ayun ung feeling na parang nahihilo ka na nahahalucinate not being OA pero on that time na i was waking him up for work ( working siya sa dream company mostly ng mga call center sa BGC ) that when i randomly check his phone and BOOM! VIBER may message siya to the girl na parang take care etc tas dalawang I LOVE YOU( memorize ko dati now ayaw ko na maalala) but the message shows he’s so inlove … Pero mabilis ako magisip before ko siya gisingin kase di pa siya nagising agad i got the mistress number and nung nagising na siya confronted him all the time nakatulala lang siya and i ask kung mahal nya sabi nya “hindi mahal na iiwan ko kayo” “????” i know in that very moment na its not the just a fling , last thing i knew nagsabi ako “pagumalis ka , ibig sabihin pinipili mo siya” sagot saken “ i just wanna know if she’s okay” fast forward i called the girl sa harap nya that time sabi saken kayo po magusap without denying anything and that night im expecting if the worst na hindi na siya uuwi na sasama na siya dun and all pero nagsabi na ren ako sa family nya ng ginawa nya and his sister even goes right away sa bahay ko to comfort me, yung family nila hindi siya typical na close knit they have indiference like other family umuwi na ate nya kase may baby den un, the morning after di ko pa den inexpect na uuwi siya saken pero that morning nagupdate SIL ko na nandun daw sakanila talking with the mom ung convo nila is may topic na he tells his mom about the girl pero mom nya super kontra pero as per

18538,1i404is,post,I feel like I'm not living my life at all,"I just want to vent here, because, I had a suicide attempt, and since then, me and my parents have been very, very close. I couldn't wish for better parents, they always understand me, play games with me, don't judge me at all. They took me to online school because after my SA I couldn't walk for a very long time, and I decided to stay there to not go back to school as I didn't really like it.

But now? I'm around 2 and a half year in the online school, and I barely leave the house. Going to the washroom makes me extremely tired, I feel like I can barely walk anymore. I haven't talked to a single person other than my parents in around a week, I don't go to restaurants, walks - I spend all days in my house, day after day after day - just waiting for my favorite games and shows to release because that's my only interest.

I don't have friends or hobbies, only my dad walks with the dog and does shopping, taking out trash etc.. I maybe left my house in 2024 less than 10 times, and it's really sad to see movies and series about teens doing crazy, silly stuff, but having overall fun, and I just feel like I'm missing it out. I don't get to experience normal childhood, I don't make any memories, nothing I do even matters anymore.

I recently started buying plushies because they help me to cope with it all, i just gather all my plushies and then lay with them, hugging them all with some tears on my face, but not really crying.

I feel really bad, I miss my old house because we moved from it, I think it would be way easier if I was being surrounded by the walls that hold all of my happiest, and overall first and best moments of my life, because in the new house, everything feels so plain... I haven't made ANY memories here, we don't have any quests or family we would visit, or they would visit us. My old school, playground, malls, they all feel like a liminal space, despite me still not moving on, I can't believe I'm not a student, I can't believe that for 5 years me and my classmates were all spending the days in one and same room but now, it will never, ever happen, I don't even have classmates anymore.

I feel like my dog doesn't like me, since I don't go for walks with her and she also been through some trauma, she doesn't react to me calling her, she doesn't jump around me when I get up, escapes whenever I want to cuddle with her, and only cuddles with my dad, and we had a great relationship with the doggie before.

I was seeing a therapist and I am taking medication, but the therapist didn't help me at all, I had many, many therapists but it just didn't work, I was telling them that I don't have the energy to go outside and live a normal life, they were telling me ""Then at least try taking out the trash, you'll start feeling like going outside then!"" And then, I didn't want to do that, the therapists suggested that maybe I'm just an introvert, and if I just don't want going outside, they can't help me, and maybe my place is at home, to slowly wither away, with each day passing faster than the other until I die lonely without friends or family.

I really don't see any other way.","I feel like I'm not living my life at all I just want to vent here, because, I had a suicide attempt, and since then, me and my parents have been very, very close.

It’s also people like that who are entering women’s safe spaces and making us feel uncomfortable and unsafe. I am a victim of SA. If you have fully transitioned and now have a vagina then I don’t mind you being in my safe space. What I do object to, is a man in a dress coming in and getting naked and putting their dick on show. That is fucking wrong. Idc what anyone says. I don’t want to be raped or have other women and young girls raped by men because they’ve been allowed in to women’s safe spaces.

18540,1i38wjg,post,"A Month Later, I'm Still Stuck on That Facebook Note","
It's been a month since the incident (Some Bullsh*t I did). You know, the one where I posted a dumb Facebook Messenger note saying, ""Tangina mo Rocelyn."" Immature? Yeah, I'll admit it. But it wasn't random- there's history behind it.

This aunt of mine has been a thorn in my family's side for years. She steals from us, manipulates my dad, disrespects my mom, and acts like she owns our home. She's even gone so far as to rearrange furniture without asking. She hides behind this mask of being caring and disciplined, but honestly, I can't look away from the bad side of her.

After the note got around, she played the victim card like a pro. ""Ang sakit sa dibdib,"" she said, like she's some saint who's only ever done good. But let's not forget the grudge she's kept over every little thing. She's never owned up to her actions, yet I'm somehow the villain for expressing how I feel.

It's been a month, and while life has moved on, I still feel stuck. Part of me regrets making the note because it gave her an easy way to twist the narrative. But another part of me doesn't regret finally letting some of my frustration out.

How do you move forward when the person you're dealing with refuses to acknowledge their own faults? I know I wasn't perfect in this situation, but it feels like I'm the only one reflecting on my actions while she's comfortably staying in her victim bubble. Anyone else been in a similar situation?","A Month Later, I'm Still Stuck on That Facebook Note

18541,1i31ba4,post,"i wont help myself and i don’t understand why, am i lazy?","TW suicide, SA, ED

i’ve never really posted on reddit before, but i cant keep rambling in my journal with no response. the people in my life love me, but they just can’t give me real answers for something they haven’t lived through. if you read this and can give me anything, thank you.

i don’t know how to organize this so i’m just gonna type and hope it’s understandable. i hope this is the right place to spill everything out, but if it isn’t i’m sorry and i will take my post down.

i am just so tired, i know everyone is and i should get over it, but i just don’t know how to.
i’ll just sum up the backstory, i am the middle child with a sister (26f) and a brother (17m). my brother was non-verbal for the first several years of his life and is autistic, my sister was often running away, stealing, all that fun stuff. she came home pregnant at 17.
my father (50m) is a narcissist i believe, we’re not entirely sure. it’s either NPD, or ignored autism that developed into something like NPD.
my mom (48f) is an angel, she does everything in this world for me. she holds our family together and loves us all INTENSELY. she is actually my best friend.

i (18f) am diagnosed with BPD, CPTSD, and ARFID. i was sexually abused by our neighbors from ages 4-8 years old (time line is blurred, could’ve started earlier or ended earlier, i remember quite enough though.) my mom was trying to balance so much with my sister and my brother, i was the “normal” one, so i wasn’t worried about, that made it easy for things to slip past. that is NOT my moms fault, if my dad wasn’t so busy in the basement talking to the woman he was cheating on her with, things would’ve been a lot easier for her. my parents are still married though, he no longer cheats on her he just sits on the couch now. 

right now, i am in my second semester of college. i did one semester at an easier to get into university, i worked really hard there and i was accepted to an even better college. so, second semester second college. it’s so crazy to be going to school at a real impressive (in my opinion lol) college, because i just barely graduated high school, i never planned on going to college. or being alive right now in all honesty. i go to the same school as my boyfriend (18m) we started dating our junior year of high school, went to different high schools. he told me i was smart, capable, and strong. after a while i believed him, and i decided i was going to do something about it. he is a very bright light in my life, it’s hard to convey with words just how much he loves me. (i’m sure you hear a lot of 18 year olds say this, but that’s gonna be my husband. even our parents know. we will be together 2 years on the 23rd this month) however, even with his support and my new motivation i just kept slipping though, i would work so hard and then this feeling would come over me, like i had to stop immediately. i was done. then i would eventually get back to work, i ended up graduating high school 1 month after the rest of my class but i did it. then, my boyfriend decided to go to a d2 school just for me. he had a million d1 offers for his sport, but with my high school transcript i couldn’t make it there with him, so he went to that first college with me. then, i worked harder and got into the d1 school he wanted to go to. 

now, he’s there and i am doing online classes from home right now. i am waiting until they get me a single dorm (disability accommodations), i took my oldest niece (8f) from my sisters house and she’s staying with me in my room right now, she’s struggling really hard. i see myself in her, except she’s a bit different. i dont think she feels empathy, it’s really strange to watch. she will intentionally harm someone, and smile. it almost warms her heart? i don’t know. i don’t know anything anymore, i take care of her the best i can. when my sister had her at 18, i was 10 and i took her. i moved her crib into my room, i spent the rough nights with her in her new born stage, im the only one who knows how to do her braids (she is black, we are all white), i’m in the process of re-braiding right now.

i’m so worried for my niece, my mom, my brother is struggling, my sister is struggling, i want to stay home and take care of them and keep helping and clean and take the kids but am i horrible?? because i actually don’t want that at all, i want to forget it all. it feels so horrible to say that, i want to go to college and get away from all of it and pretend it’s not my problem. 

i need money, i need to get my niece a phone so she can call me any time, i need to pay for my own food (having ARFID, eating is extremely difficult for me, it needs to be food i am okay with) but i just can’t work. i am doing all my classes online, so i could work but my body doesn’t wanna move. i’ve had jobs before, and when i’m in some sort of episode i can hear my brain screaming and the screaming is so loud. i don’t even have a license, i can’t drive. i was scared of driving for the longest time and i still am, but even if i wasn’t i don’t have a car to get my license with. 

i don’t work, i don’t drive, i don’t have bills right now, and all i want to do is get away from my life and go to school. that makes me feel lazy & like a piece of shit, what do i have to be stressed out about?? i cant even imagine what some of you are going through, why am i like this? i want so badly to go to parties. i want to be that girl that sticks her head out the window of a car with sunglasses on or something. i want to get drunk. (i don’t drink due to ARFID) i want to be a crazy stupid college girl, i wanna be blonde or something. i want to go to my classes and be awesome, i want to have a job and a car that i can annoyingly jangle the keys to. i want to drink starbucks and not care who the company is. i just don’t do any of that though. i sit in my room, i worry, i do my school work, i take care of the kids, i hang out with my mom, i play video games with my boyfriend. i’ve never been to a party, too many germs, too loud, drunk people, bad things happen at parties. 

i love my classes, i am going to be a fashion designer. it’s what i’ve always wanted, and i just love being a student now that i’m out of high school. i want to know how to make money from home, on my phone or my laptop. doesn’t anyone know of completely online jobs? pretty sure my oldest niece is a sociopath or something, y’all should see her little smile when she knows someone is hurt because of her. she really is my sweet girl, i love her so much how do i fix her brain? i have 2 nieces and 3 nephews and i am not joking they’re all pretty messed up in some way. i don’t know how to help my sister. i am pretty sure my brain is exploding or something i’m not sure. i need to focus on getting an online job, i am terrified of the Norovirus (emetophobia, extremely severe. that’s how i developed ARFID. if i feel as if i could be sick i will stop eating for days, i try not to leave the house when that goes around.) 

i will stop rambling- to sum it up:
• entirely online jobs?
• why am i like this
• do you think i’m lazy
• how do i help my niece 
• how do i function 
• help

thank you if you read this thank you so so much
","i wont help myself and i don’t understand why, am i lazy? TW suicide, SA, ED

i’ve never really posted on reddit before, but i cant keep rambling in my journal with no response. the people in my life love me, but they just can’t give me real answers for something they haven’t lived through. if you read this and can give me anything, thank you.

i don’t know how to organize this so i’m just gonna type and hope it’s understandable. i hope this is the right place to spill everything out, but if it isn’t i’m sorry and i will take my post down.

i am just so tired, i know everyone is and i should get over it, but i just don’t know how to.
i’ll just sum up the backstory, i am the middle child with a sister (26f) and a brother (17m). my brother was non-verbal for the first several years of his life and is autistic, my sister was often running away, stealing, all that fun stuff. she came home pregnant at 17.
my father (50m) is a narcissist i believe, we’re not entirely sure. it’s either NPD, or ignored autism that developed into something like NPD.
my mom (48f) is an angel, she does everything in this world for me. she holds our family together and loves us all INTENSELY. she is actually my best friend.

i (18f) am diagnosed with BPD, CPTSD, and ARFID. i was sexually abused by our neighbors from ages 4-8 years old (time line is blurred, could’ve started earlier or ended earlier, i remember quite enough though.) my mom was trying to balance so much with my sister and my brother, i was the “normal” one, so i wasn’t worried about, that made it easy for things to slip past. that is NOT my moms fault, if my dad wasn’t so busy in the basement talking to the woman he was cheating on her with, things would’ve been a lot easier for her. my parents are still married though, he no longer cheats on her he just sits on the couch now. 

right now, i am in my second semester of college. i did one semester at an easier to get into university, i worked really hard there and i was accepted to an even better college. so, second semester second college. it’s so crazy to be going to school at a real impressive (in my opinion lol) college, because i just barely graduated high school, i never planned on going to college. or being alive right now in all honesty. i go to the same school as my boyfriend (18m) we started dating our junior year of high school, went to different high schools. he told me i was smart, capable, and strong. after a while i believed him, and i decided i was going to do something about it. he is a very bright light in my life, it’s hard to convey with words just how much he loves me. (i’m sure you hear a lot of 18 year olds say this, but that’s gonna be my husband. even our parents know. we will be together 2 years on the 23rd this month) however, even with his support and my new motivation i just kept slipping though, i would work so hard and then this feeling would come over me, like i had to stop immediately. i was done. then i would eventually get back to work, i ended up graduating high school 1 month after the rest of my class but i did it. then, my boyfriend decided to go to a d2 school just for me. he had a million d1 offers for his sport, but with my high school transcript i couldn’t make it there with him, so he went to that first college with me. then, i worked harder and got into the d1 school he wanted to go to.

im in a good relationship, a happy relationship. we're very committed to each other, etc. but i went through his stuff on my pc (which i know i shouldnt have done) and i found relatively harmless videos of women while we were together (softcore p\*rn). it fucked me up. it made me so angry. maybe im too ""conservative"" in that way and maybe im too uptight but im sorry, i cant lie about my feelings. i confronted him about it, and ive been doing that stuff that he watches for him in hopes he wont do it again. but theres this resentment, this just genuine hatred. i guess theres way more to it too, there was some stuff between us (not related to this) that really upset me.

lately i just completely disconnected from everyone. just went completely numb. but idk, tonight i feel angry. im not a bad person. i try to be fair to everyone constantly but it just feels like people serve me betrayal after betrayal. im so done with everyone, not just my bf. i wish i could be the person i was a few years ago. someone completely disconnected who didnt give a fck if i had no one in my life at all. but i care about all of them and i cant leave them now. i also struggle with mental health and although i offer everone else support i barely get any myself. im just so done. i wish i could fuck right off and never speak to anyone again. i dont know what to do, but to just seek random advise online. for anyone to just take me seriously.

im just tired man, but it seems like the more and more i just live it seems like all my morals are not up to date to everyone elses. watching other girls online is not labelled cheating anymore so im sensitive, letting ur friends bully u is just banter right?

my brother wrote in his suicide letter that he couldnt handle the world, i didnt understand that when i wa 14, but i do now. im just a mess. im insecure, my trust completely shattered. i used to be a person who offered advised and loved to be there for everyone, but im tired of being the one who communicates constantly and is taken the absolute piss out of. im just done. 

i dont know. this says ""off my chest"" so im just typing anything. i do a lot of work on myself and i have constantly in my life because i always felt like the problem. i had a troubled childhood, i was SAed, i was belittled and bullied, i was physically abused by a parental figure, im autistic and never taken seriously bc i live in a third world country. god, life just sucks.","i still resent my bf for the stuff i found on his account, and more yeah so, idk where to go w this. so im just gonna post it here.

18545,1i1iyzh,post,I feel like ending myself ,"Female. I have a dissociative disorder and I'm severely traumatised from chronic SA and r\*pe I experienced as a child by my father. 

Every day I hear voices that psychologically torture me all day every day. 24/7, 365. They even deliberately deprive me of sleep, abusing me still all through the night, to punish me for existing. They aren't hallucinations BTW, they're dissociative self-states that developed involuntarily in childhood.

I think about hanging myself daily and sometimes I just get a knife and hold it to my chest and fantasise about stabbing myself.

My flat is a mess, I'm living in squalor because I'm a barely functional zombie. I shower every 2-3 days on average because I have a mental block preventing me from doing basic tasks. I do not have ADHD.

I spend 5 days a week in complete isolation and then go to college twice a week but my attendance is poor and I'm on the verge of being kicked out. I wanted to get into a specific university so bad but it looks like that's not going to happen. 

I've got insomnia, sleeping 2-4 hours a night/day, in 1-2 hour bursts, with horrifying nightmares. 

I'm also a binge eater and go between skipping meals some days and eating more than a man eats in a day on others (I'm underweight though). My body image is poor, I just want to be thin at all costs, and being called a fat pig by the abusive voices in my head every day doesn't help.

  
I have no reason to live. Nothing can undo this pain. I just want to step off a chair with a rope around my neck, I'm waiting for the mental block to lift. ","I feel like ending myself  Female.

18548,1i0xozg,post,First time in a rs dilemma ,"19F, first time in a rs with 19M

19/F, in a rs with 19/M. 4 months. Kahapon umattend kami ng overnight debut and nag-usap kami. Deeptalks ganun kasi overnight and di makatulog. Normal lang samin yung biruan kasi friends to lovers kami. Pero napapansin ko na sinasabi nya na mabilis akong mapikon. Sya din nmn tbh pero ang pino-point nya is antagal ko magpatawad daw, compared sa kanya na ok na agad. Pero napagusapan na djn naman namin, sinabi ko din sa kaniya na most of the time umaasta syang ""girl"" sa rs. But pabirong way din. He took it naman and may part din sakaniya na nag agree. Then umabot na sa kwentuhan.

Una nyang sinabi is ""beh, alam mo nung una ayaw ko talaga sayo gawa ng overbite mo"" added pa yung skin color ko sa face nun. Hindi pa kasi talaga me nag-aalaga ng mukha, puro acads lang din and sya ang first bf ko. Alam ko na nman yun, jahahah kahit ngayon nga na madalas nya na ko kinoconpliment, i'm having a hard time believing. Na-bully din me nung elem gawa ng skin color ko, ang gala ko kasi nung bata puro laro. Ako naman, sinabi ko din na i was just curious din, saka gusto ko lang maka-experience ng hs love. Baka sakali na madami din akong matutunan and maimprove socializing skills ko. Then isang pinaka prob din dun is madami din me mga sumpa sa legs na main insecurity ko. 

Pero i started taking care of myself na din. Bumalik na yung kulay ko, konti nalang sa arms. Yung scars sa legs gawa ng insect bites is hindi na gaano kavisible pero merun pa din which nag sto-stop padin sakin magshorts/skirts. Kasi nakakahiya.

Balik tayo, sinabihan ko si bf na ang torpe nya. Hindi sya nanunuyo nung una, parang nagagalit din sya. Sabi nya sa'kin is hindi talaga sya torpe nun, hindi lang talaga nya ako gusto. Ikinakahiya pa nga raw nya ako. Medj bumaba self-worth ko. Sinabi nya rin na mostly kasi broken pa sya nun. Pero ang bullseye talaga is sinabi nya na ayaw nya lang ako masaktan kaya tinuloy nalang nya, like go with the flow. Naramdaman ko din naman yun dati. Like parang everything adds up, sa behaviour nya ang all.

Then i started doing skincare nun, kasi nga parang medj naging self-consious ako pero di pa nya sinasabi sakin lahat ng yun, parang na-gut feeling ko lang. Medj namuti and kuminis din face ko. And along with it is parang nag-iba trato nya.

Nagtaka ako anong nangyari. Bigla syang lumambot. Sabi nya gawa daw ng pinaramdam ko sa kanya. Meron din kasi syang past rs traumas. Ako daw nagbigay nung hinahanap nyang pagmamahal. Syempre in im not dumb actually to believe that, pero when time flies by, parang genuine na sya. Ilang beses na nya akong iniyakan, tapos napaka seloso. Isa pa is gusto nya lagi akong makita and may ano nga syang sinasabi eh, ""siguro ginayuma mo ko"" hahaha madalas nya rin sabihin na wag ko raw sya iiwan. 

He's a good guy tbh, good to his mom, nagseseryoso na din sa acads, and cares for me. Average guy lang sya actually, hindi pangit pero hindi din pogi, coming from him din. Ang alam nya is naging crush ko sya. Ilang beses ko naman sinasabi na hindi 'crush' na gustong maging bf yun. Admiration lang yung nafeel ko kasi napaka friendly nya and tgoughtful. 

Nung time na before kami magstart is i just got out of a talking stage rs which is hindi naman handa pa yung guy. Puro gaming, i liked him lang nun kasi nagdevelop lang nung nalaman ko na he likes me. 

I'm not pretty i admit noon. Pero i was confident kasi i did really well sa acads. Madalas din ako na hy-hype kasi sabi magaling daw ako sa english when it comes to public speaking. Pinka prob ko lang talaga is expressing. Paano ba maging straightforward sa tao? Pinapangunahan kasi ako na baka masaktan ko yung feelings. Now na comfortable na sakin si bf maging straightforward, gusto ko din. Hindi ko kasi vinavalidate feelings ko, even pag may prob kami, tas sa huli ako na naman yung malinsa paningin nya. I'm slowly learning.

Update naman kay bf is everyday ka-call. And sinabi nya rin sakin na hindi nya nakikita future nya pag wala ako. Isa pa is ako na daw yung last risk nya in love. Di na daw sya uulit pag nawala ako, pero alam ko naman na sabi nya lang yun. Alam nya rin na hindi ko pa talaga sya nakikita sa future ko. Nakikita pero blurry pa din. Sabi ko, baka may character development pa naman kasi sabi nya na ako daw ang first gf nya, hindi daw counted yung last nya kasi parang wala namang ligawan stage.

Sh*t di ko alam, as a nbsb girl, 6 months din sya nanligaw, kasama na dun yung parang go with the flow lang na pagkatorpe nya. Actually, parang hindi naman ligaw yun eh, magkaklase kami and parang lagi lang magkasama ganun. I was fed up din kasi parang di naman talaga nanligaw, parang ang pathetic ko din kasi may times na i acted like his mother. Gasgas din to sa self-esteem ko. Pero ngayon, i can't deny na mahal na mahal nya na ako. At he's trying na. Pero what do i do if sometimes naiisip ko na i deserve so much better. Maybe i'll observe for now, i'll still love genuinely gaya nung dati. Pero sana sinabi nya noon pa. May pa ano pa sya na kaya raw ako nag ""glow up"" kasi magaling daw sya mag-alaga. Wow. I know for a fact na hindi talaga para sa kanya ang pag skincare ko, but for my own self-worth. Factor lang yun. Isa pa is napakabait skain ng fam nya, idk what to do. Lalo na yung mother nya. We're 4 months na in a rs. I'll stay muna with him pero naiisip ko din sometimes na parang mas ok na tapusin ko na as a healthy breakup kasi may part sakin na hindi compatible sa kanya. Eldest child me, with strict parents, last card din sa family and we're not doing well financially. Kilala sya ng fam ko but hindi gaano ka approve. Sabi nya nga na madami pa syang dapat patunayan. Idk maybe bata pa kasi din ako, and i don't know what's best. Pero mahal ko na din talaga to eh.

To clarify, i'm not asking if i'm wrong or anything. Just seeking for advice from experienced pips with better understanding and such.","First time in a rs dilemma  19F, first time in a rs with 19M

19/F, in a rs with 19/M. 4 months. Kahapon umattend kami ng overnight debut and nag-usap kami. Deeptalks ganun kasi overnight and di makatulog. Normal lang samin yung biruan kasi friends to lovers kami. Pero napapansin ko na sinasabi nya na mabilis akong mapikon. Sya din nmn tbh pero ang pino-point nya is antagal ko magpatawad daw, compared sa kanya na ok na agad. Pero napagusapan na djn naman namin, sinabi ko din sa kaniya na most of the time umaasta syang ""girl"" sa rs. But pabirong way din. He took it naman and may part din sakaniya na nag agree. Then umabot na sa kwentuhan.

Una nyang sinabi is ""beh, alam mo nung una ayaw ko talaga sayo gawa ng overbite mo"" added pa yung skin color ko sa face nun. Hindi pa kasi talaga me nag-aalaga ng mukha, puro acads lang din and sya ang first bf ko. Alam ko na nman yun, jahahah kahit ngayon nga na madalas nya na ko kinoconpliment, i'm having a hard time believing. Na-bully din me nung elem gawa ng skin color ko, ang gala ko kasi nung bata puro laro. Ako naman, sinabi ko din na i was just curious din, saka gusto ko lang maka-experience ng hs love. Baka sakali na madami din akong matutunan and maimprove socializing skills ko. Then isang pinaka prob din dun is madami din me mga sumpa sa legs na main insecurity ko. 

Pero i started taking care of myself na din. Bumalik na yung kulay ko, konti nalang sa arms. Yung scars sa legs gawa ng insect bites is hindi na gaano kavisible pero merun pa din which nag sto-stop padin sakin magshorts/skirts. Kasi nakakahiya.

Balik tayo, sinabihan ko si bf na ang torpe nya. Hindi sya nanunuyo nung una, parang nagagalit din sya. Sabi nya sa'kin is hindi talaga sya torpe nun, hindi lang talaga nya ako gusto. Ikinakahiya pa nga raw nya ako. Medj bumaba self-worth ko. Sinabi nya rin na mostly kasi broken pa sya nun. Pero ang bullseye talaga is sinabi nya na ayaw nya lang ako masaktan kaya tinuloy nalang nya, like go with the flow. Naramdaman ko din naman yun dati. Like parang everything adds up, sa behaviour nya ang all.

Then i started doing skincare nun, kasi nga parang medj naging self-consious ako pero di pa nya sinasabi sakin lahat ng yun, parang na-gut feeling ko lang. Medj namuti and kuminis din face ko. And along with it is parang nag-iba trato nya.

Nagtaka ako anong nangyari. Bigla syang lumambot. Sabi nya gawa daw ng pinaramdam ko sa kanya. Meron din kasi syang past rs traumas. Ako daw nagbigay nung hinahanap nyang pagmamahal. Syempre in im not dumb actually to believe that, pero when time flies by, parang genuine na sya. Ilang beses na nya akong iniyakan, tapos napaka seloso. Isa pa is gusto nya lagi akong makita and may ano nga syang sinasabi eh, ""siguro ginayuma mo ko"" hahaha madalas nya rin sabihin na wag ko raw sya iiwan. 

He's a good guy tbh, good to his mom, nagseseryoso na din sa acads, and cares for me. Average guy lang sya actually, hindi pangit pero hindi din pogi, coming from him din.

Kaya minsan para wala ng gulo I take the blame. As much as I wanted to move out, I am not yet financially stable. Nag-aaral pa ako. I have two jobs pero di enough yung kita, sakto lang pambayad ko ng bills ko. Tsaka, my parents din ay minsan tinutulungan ako sa bills ko then I told them na I'll pay them soon.

Kuya ko, married na. Ako? Wala eh. I am actually having an identity crisis din kasi. Alam ko na di tanggap ng mom ko na magka relationship sa kapwa babae. Also, isang kapatid ko 21 yrs. old na pero puro laro inaatupag. Yung tipong wala syang tulong naidulot sa bahay kundi laro lang. Kaya ang hirap kasi ako lang yung tanging mapag hingan ng tulong ni mama sa ibang bagay. Tsaka, my mom is not getting younger din minsan may araw masakit head nya kaya need may mag stand as ilaw ng bahay. I'm glad naman andyan yung cousins ko sa house dahil minsan may mapag-utusan for chores (I also help), but ewan idk what to feel. Na burn-out lang siguro ako dahil bukod sa pakiramdam ko para akong alipin, isa din akong emotional dumpster ni mom. Nakikinig naman ako at minsan nag bibigay ng advice kahit di need and as much as possible ay di ko sya inaabsorb, pero minsan hindi ko alam bakit nalulungkot ako, apektado ako kahit I practiced the art of detachment naman. Basta family siguro napaka soft-hearted ko kaya ang hirap e comprehend minsan. 

Lord, sana naman. This 2025, magkaroon  naman ako ng isang WFH na makatulong sa expenses ko. Ayoko ko kasing isipin ni mama na wala aking kwenta. Ayoko run maramdaman na nagpapa alipin ako dahil sa di enough yung pera ko. Sa 2023 and 2024, naisipan kong mag voluntary exit sa mundo, apra sa ganun mababayaran ko yung magulang ko. Sobra pa naman yung benefits ko sa insurance na matatanggap nila. 
Pero nakakalungkot dahil ang hirap mawala sa mundo lalo na at si papa noong andito sya sa Pinas, sabi niya sa akin na ""make me proud."" naiiyak ako dun, siya lang kasi nag tanong sa aking kung okay lang ba ako kasi daw napakabigat ng mata ko at ang lungkot ko raw. Kaya imbes na magpapa(u-know-already) ako, di ko mag awa dahil kawawa naman sila, baka di nila maiintindihan kung bakit. Kaya no choice ako, patuloy nalang ako sa buhay kahit alam ko wala na akong direksyon. 

Magabayan ko lang mga kapatid ko maging matagumpay sa buhay okay na ako. Baka pwede na. Tsaka, mag third yr narin ako sa law school this year. Good luck sa akin. Another year of survival ulit.

18551,1hzwnbq,post,I had a fling w a 16 yo as an 18 yo and i feel like a pdf file,"TW: mention of SA
At 18F over the summer after graduating from high school, I had a 1-2 month long fling with a 16M who was going into his junior year of high school. I remember before hand having a suspicion he had a crush on me when we were just friends, and he is not a bad looking guy.
After a month or 2 of being friends, istarted to develop a crush on him myself and I felt a little off about it ,so l asked some of my close online friends about it and they seemed on the fence at first. But when I explained that I would only do anything if he initiated it and the fact that it would've been more just a friends with benefits thing rather then a relationship ( as i felt i wasn't mentally ready for a committed relationship), and the fact that he looked older then me at 16, they thought it wasn't that big of a deal. So l decided to stop worrying since nothing was likely going to come out of it anyways. But a week after that conversation, he admitted to liking me and I told him i sort of felt the si way but iwould feel weird initiating anythi. because of the age gap, which he understood; and he didn't seem like the type to initiate so idida't think anything would happen.
About a week later, we decided to hangout and get drunk (i had only gotten drunk like once before this and he got drunk pretty often) I honestly at that point just wanted to get drunk because at that time I had just gotten raped and was struggling to cope and alcohol would help. But anyways, we both got drunk, I gotsignificantly more drunk then he did to the point i couldn't sit upright and i had to lay on his lap, and then and there, he initiated us making out. I was pretty out of it being drunk only one or two times before this and having a low tolerance, but I definitely did not mind it.
After that hangout, we started hanging out more often, just watching tv shows together and such and stuff like that. Then after like a month or so of doing that, I almost got trafficked trying to go to a house party and only had him to lean on, and at that time, i was considering cutting things off because I didn't feel right but then that happened so I didn't because i needed the emotional support.
Though soon after, he cut things off because he felt like he was a bad influence on me and i was upset as the only emotional support i seemed to have vanished. To this day I can't tell if I forced myself to develop a crush on him as I have done that before because I struggle +~ make friends and the only people that wi. befriend me are guys who think they have a chance of fucking me. So I don't know if this makes me a pedophile or not and I'm afraid people are going to find out about the fling and think I'm weird and/or stop being friends with me because of it. I need you guys to tell me how bad what i did was i genuinely think about it every single day and the anxiety and self disgust i feel because of It has debilitated me from doing a lot of the things I have wanted to do please let me know what you guys think","I had a fling w a 16 yo as an 18 yo and i feel like a pdf file TW: mention of SA

Important details: ako na gumagawa mostly  ng gawaing bahay pwera lang sa magluto ng ulam and akala ko sapat na yon. College student din pala ako kaya you can imagine how tiring school is. I have sister a jhs student (Grade 10). Pinaka important na detail is may bf ako (already working) and 3 yrs na kami.

Nabasa ko yung mga chat ng papa ko sa stepmom ko about sakin na ""nakakatamad na raw ako pag aralin"" since nakafocus lang daw ako sa bf ko all the time (feeling nila siguro kapag hawak ko phone ko magka vc kami haha) at nag sumisikap lang daw ako mag aral dahil gusto ko magpasikat sa bf ko at hindi dahil sa kanila (achiever ako simula jhs until now, wala pa bf ko achiever na ako) All of these because of hindi ako nakakapag handa ng ulam. Umabot sila sa ganyang sitwasyon. Pero ako na yung nag sasaing, nag huhugas ng pinggan, etc. (pwera lang sa pag hahanda ng ulam, and pag lalaba ng damit dahil mga medyas, towels, and underwear lang ang naka assign sakin na labhan ko)

Edi sumama loob ko, at hindi ko sila pinapansin. Kasi nasa isip ko pwede naman nila akong sabihan ng maayos at agad agad pero bakit kailangan ganyanin nila ko. Gagawin ko naman agad kung sasabihin lang nila. Hanggang sa hindi na rin nila ako kinikibo at kwinento nila ako sa mga kamag anak namin na kesyo mas pinipili ko raw bf ko over them (dahil lang sa ulam ah).

Ang ikinakasama ng loob ko lang din bakit laging puro ako lang? Bakit hindi nila sinasabihan kapatid ko? Dahil ako yung mas nakakatanda ganon? 

Edi limang araw na lumipas hindi pa rin kami nagkikibuan kaya minessage ko yung tatay ko kung ano dahilan and such. Nilabas ko yung sama ng loob ko. Kasi laging nangyayari 'to e lagi silang may pinapanigan, masyado nilang inispoil yung anak nila (kahit sagutin sagutin sila at may INC sa card). At sinabi ko ron sa message ko na kung laging ganon parang mas okay kung nakahiwalay ako ng bahay sa kanila. Para hindi na rin kami nagkakasilipan. And sinabi ko rin na hindi ako pag mamay-ari ng tatay ko (which is true).

And guess what? Ang nireply ng tatay ko sa message ko na pinag isipan at lakas loob ko na i-send is nag mamalaki raw ako hahaha. Bakit ko raw nasisilip kapatid ko lagi. Makasarili raw ako. Wala raw ako kung wala sya. Ilang taon daw sya nag hirap sakin tas mag aasawa lang daw agad ako pag tapos (kahit wala naman akong sinabi haha). Kung aalis daw ako ng bahay kalimutan ko na rin daw na may ama ako. At ayaw nya raw makita mukha ko kahit sa burol nya.

Ngayon hindi ko alam kung ano gagawin ko, hindi ko alam kung dapat ba akong umalis na sa bahay namin. Kaso wala pa akong income/ work. And ayoko namang umasa sa bf ko.

Can you please help me? If may alam kayong work, ojt ko na rin kasi sa March or April.

18553,1hzt49r,post,There’s a thing that repeats in my head that my brother told me when our mom died.,"I can’t get it out of my head. I was 12 and my brother was 17 when our mom died. I remember crying, and him always getting mad at me because I was only 12 and didn’t spend much time with her. 

Any time I was sad over her death he would get mad at me so I bottled it up for a very long time saying things like “I didn’t know her long so it didn’t affect me as much as my dad and brother.”

After she passed away I went through this long string of trauma, self destruction, SA, just being horrible to myself.

I’m 31 and I found out in therapy very recently that my mom passing away did affect me so much, I basically wasted so much time being self destructive that I never sought help because I was embarrassed for being so sad.


My brother and I have a great relationship today. I don’t think he remembers what he told me and I don’t think I would tell him. Not now. He’s an alcoholic stuck in a dead end job and will not take help or advice and he’s also very depressed and I think that me bringing that up would hurt him more. I don’t need him to know that I remember what I said. I have my therapist for that.

So anyway. I have never told anyone outside of my therapist this. I need to say it out loud that even though I only knew my mom for 12 years, I still really miss her even to this day. ","There’s a thing that repeats in my head that my brother told me when our mom died. I can’t get it out of my head. I was 12 and my brother was 17 when our mom died. I remember crying, and him always getting mad at me because I was only 12 and didn’t spend much time with her. 

Any time I was sad over her death he would get mad at me so I bottled it up for a very long time saying things like “I didn’t know her long so it didn’t affect me as much as my dad and brother.”

After she passed away I went through this long string of trauma, self destruction, SA, just being horrible to myself.

I’m 31 and I found out in therapy very recently that my mom passing away did affect me so much, I basically wasted so much time being self destructive that I never sought help because I was embarrassed for being so sad.

18554,1hzqng0,post,I am scared my father will wreck his sick brother,"
It is going to be a long mess, I apologize.

My father's brother (let's call him Mike) has cancer and Mike wants to reunite with my father but my father is very emotionally immature and it just won't happen.

My father is very immature and abusive. I am 24 and I never got to meet a soul in that body. I don't know much about his past. I know he had a difficult childhood (SA, abuse, etc), he was very close with Mike, they were like twins, something really big happened, my father deserted the army, the family rejected him, he never recovered. I think their mom was his refuge but she got sick when he was in his 20s, something neuro, she suffered for 10 years before she passed away and it was just awful and very traumatic. Their dad passed away in 2009, lots of suffering too.
I've always known my father as a very immature, abusive one, physically, mentally, he's a 2 year old in a man's body, he throws tantrums, spits on us, zero discernment. He doesn't work, no hobbies, no social circle.

I don't know much about Mike. I've met him once in 2009.
I know for sure my father resents Mike and is jealous of him (Mike is wealthy and in good terms with the family) They saw each other at their parents funerals (2009 & 1998), but I don't think they have ever had a proper conversation since like.. the 80s.
We can assume Mike does not know how my father turned out.

From what I've heard, Mike has stage 4 cancer with bone metastasis. He's in a lot of pain. To me it's very clear he wants to reunite with his brother.
Mike got my father's phone number through their sisters and he tries to start a conversation with my father but it doesn't work.

I know my father. He does feel sad about Mike's diagnosis but it's very self centered. He does NOT have the ABILITY to care for others and he CANNOT be a supportive friend. He does not have that in him.

I feel so bad for Mike. I have a terminal illness. So I know for a fact my father will never be the caring person Mike is seeking. My father does not give a ..flower about me. He is my legal caregiver because he saw the opportunity to legally stop working and he used to take my disability money when I was in a coma. I found out he does not understand the value of life. That man is soulless.

I am hiding & crying in the bathroom because I feel so sad for Mike. What he wants will not happen.
He sent multiple text messages to my father today. He sent a photo of their dad's gusset watch with a hidden message my father left inside when they were kids. My father's reaction: ""this proves the watch is mine"". Another example, Mike ended a message saying ""chemo start again on [date]"". No reaction. He sent his home address and said he'd love to meet again. It's been going on for a month now. My father mostly leaves Mike on read or redirects the conversation on him. Not even us, on HIM. His motorcycle, travel photos, etc. 

I know I cannot do anything. I can send a card to Mike's family or something but Mike wants to reunite with his BROTHER. Like I said, I am sick myself. Being given false hope is the worst thing that can happen to you in life. My father does not have the thing in him to care. I can't help but cry. Mike will never get his brother back. I don't want him to suffer

Ps : Mother was not mentioned here because she's just as emotionally immature as my father. My big sister is the one who raised me and we've always been the adults of the family","I am scared my father will wreck his sick brother

18555,1hzdqfh,post,I’ve never told anyone what he did to me until this post… long post…,"Ten years ago in 2014 I (19F at the time) met my now ex through mutual friends on Facebook. After communicating through social media for two months he finally asked me for a date. I was very excited. I even purchased a new dress that was black chiffon with long sleeves that cuffed around my wrists. It was a midi and flowed like the ocean at midnight. It also had a bright gold sequin fabric that wrapped around to the back of the dress where it zipped up to the middle of my back. I paired it with black velvet boots that stopped mid thigh with five inch heels. I even got my nails and hair done. Needless to say I was planning on this to be my last first date. I thought I had found the one. 

Around 7pm, there was a knock at my parent’s door. Yes I was still living with my parents at 19yo and in the middle of college. I had a lot going for me. Anyways, my dad yells, “come in!” Once the door cracked open our eyes met and the butterflies were screaming in my stomach. I had only felt this way about one other person and it was my high school love. But this man was perfect for me. I thought at the time. 

He had a great job making 99k a year with great benefits. He was kind, dressed very well, nice hair, deep golden brown eyes, and told me all the right things. He was polite. Opening doors, using manners, and even shaking my dad’s hand before we left. He told me that he would take good care of me. I was thinking wow I’m in really good hands. 

Anyways the date went well. We had a very nice dinner at an exquisite restaurant. Our conversations were about our goals, where we saw ourselves in five, ten, and twenty years. I was head over heels for this man. 

A month later we made it official. I was proud that this man was my boyfriend and he was proud to show me off to his friends and family. Until a few months later, all of that stopped. 

A switch flipped in him. All of the compliments and sweet gestures turned into insults and rage. Anything I did that he didn’t like or if I said my opinion out loud he would lose his mind. Punching holes in walls, ripping the door off the hinges with his bare hands, and then crying to me after. He would apologize profusely. He begged me not to leave. Promised he would change. 

Unfortunately, this would only last a couple weeks each time. I couldn’t leave because of the threats of offing himself if I did were always in the back of my mind. Trust me. I tried to leave many times. I was also only 19 years old. I was naive and knew nothing outside of my parents sheltered lifestyle I was brought up in. I was scared and couldn’t tell anyone. I was stuck with no way out. 

He never put his hands on me during these fits, but there is one incident that he did come close. This one was it for me. This terrified me more than holes in the walls and doors thrown down the halls.

One night, myself, my ex, his sister, and his sister’s boyfriend, were all sitting in the living room of his grandparents house around midnight. We were having friendly conversation until I looked over at ex and his whole demeanor changed. His pupils looked dilated and I could see the anger in his eyes. That switch had been flipped. He started insulting his sister whom was only 17 years old at the time. He made her cry so she decided to go outside on the front porch to be alone. I looked over at sister’s boyfriend. He was looking at my ex. Then sister’s boyfriend stood up. His 6 foot 8 inch stature towering over my 5 foot 11 inch ex. He was no match for the sister’s boyfriend. I try to prepare myself for whatever’s about to happen. My ex turned and runs outside chasing after his sister. Sister’s boyfriend followed. I was afraid to go out there. I didn’t want to see what was about to happen. Until I heard her scream. I jumped up and ran to the front door that was already swung wide open. I see my ex with his sister’s shirt in his grip which he used to sling her down on the ground. He was on top of her now trying to stop her from scratching him but she eventually did scratch his face with her long nails. He slapped her so hard after that. My heart stopped. My fight or flight kicked in. I needed to leave. I was terrified. Sister’s boyfriend finally stepped in and threw him off of her and then my ex ran around the side of the house where his truck was. His sister ran to the bathroom and I followed behind to help her. Once in the bathroom we hear the front door slam. I had chills go down my spine. I thought oh no he’s coming back for more. I knew if he saw me helping his sister that I would be next. He just proved to me that he doesn’t mind putting his hands on a woman or child as I saw it. 

I hear his heavy boots stomping on the floor. Coming closer and closer. He barges in the small 6x6 bathroom shoving me and sister’s boyfriend out of the way. Ex grabs his sister’s shirt around the collar, yanks her towards his face, and starts screaming at her. I’m standing in the small hallway absolutely frozen. He gets up and finally leaves his sister alone. Sister’s boyfriend helps her and cleans her up. I’m still in the hallway watching my ex pace back and forth in the kitchen cussing, throwing pots and pans, and isn’t showing any signs of stopping. For whatever stupid reason, I told him to just calm down. He ran at me. Pinned me to the refrigerator that was behind me. His face was about an inch or two away from mine. He put his finger in my face and screamed “if you don’t shut the f*** up then you’ll be next.” He let me go and went back outside. I ran straight to his room grabbed my car keys and my bag then I peeked out the bedroom door to make sure he wasn’t coming. Once down the hallway I saw the front door and ran straight towards it. I opened it, left it open, and ran straight to my car. Then I heard him yelling “where do you think you’re going”

I had one foot in my car but he was too close. I couldn’t just jump in my car and lock the doors. I told him that I was leaving. He then dropped to his knees, begged me not to leave, and said to me that he was going to off hisself and if he did then I would be the one to blame. I would be responsible and go to jail for it. I had no clue how the law worked. What could I do? I thought for a moment. I didn’t want to spend the rest of my life in jail. I couldn’t live with him doing that on my conscience for the rest of my life. So I closed the door, walked over to him, and said ok I’ll stay. He hugged my waist and apologized profusely for the events of that night. He got up with one arm around my waist as he walked me back inside to his bedroom. We had laid down and he went to sleep. But I did not. I was away laying there unable to get up because of the firm grip he had around my stomach. Five hours later I could see the sun coming up. He finally rolled over letting me go. I slowly slid out of bed. Tears building up in my eyes out of fear he might wake up. I grabbed my keys and quietly walked to the front door. Once outside I ran so fast to my car and got out of there. I went straight home, scared to tell my parent what’s had happened. 

He always told me no one would believe me so I just never said anything. He SA’d me several month later which lead to the pregnancy of my first child. Today my daughter is eight years old and he has visitation with her for one day a week. I have no choice but to see him and communicate with him. Now I get to live with the fact that I have to send my daughter with him once a week. It’s absolute hell for me. 

So there’s my story. It’s just good to finally get it off my chest even if no one reads it all the way through.

18559,1hwh2if,post,"A Month Later, I’m Still Stuck on That Facebook Note","
It’s been a month since the incident (Some Bullsh*t I did). You know, the one where I posted a dumb Facebook Messenger note saying, “Tangina mo Rocelyn.” Immature? Yeah, I’ll admit it. But it wasn’t random—there’s history behind it.

This aunt of mine has been a thorn in my family’s side for years. She steals from us, manipulates my dad, disrespects my mom, and acts like she owns our home. She’s even gone so far as to rearrange furniture without asking. She hides behind this mask of being caring and disciplined, but honestly, I can’t look away from the bad side of her.

After the note got around, she played the victim card like a pro. “Ang sakit sa dibdib,” she said, like she’s some saint who’s only ever done good. But let’s not forget the grudge she’s kept over every little thing. She’s never owned up to her actions, yet I’m somehow the villain for expressing how I feel.

It’s been a month, and while life has moved on, I still feel stuck. Part of me regrets making the note because it gave her an easy way to twist the narrative. But another part of me doesn’t regret finally letting some of my frustration out.

How do you move forward when the person you’re dealing with refuses to acknowledge their own faults? I know I wasn’t perfect in this situation, but it feels like I’m the only one reflecting on my actions while she’s comfortably staying in her victim bubble. Anyone else been in a similar situation?

But let’s not forget the grudge she’s kept over every little thing. She’s never owned up to her actions, yet I’m somehow the villain for expressing how I feel.

It’s been a month, and while life has moved on, I still feel stuck. Part of me regrets making the note because it gave her an easy way to twist the narrative. But another part of me doesn’t regret finally letting some of my frustration out.

How do you move forward when the person you’re dealing with refuses to acknowledge their own faults? I know I wasn’t perfect in this situation, but it feels like I’m the only one reflecting on my actions while she’s comfortably staying in her victim bubble. Anyone else been in a similar situation?

I somehow was performing pretty good this year too, but the moment assignments come into play I can’t just bet on somehow already knowing it. I have this huge assignment, it had to be done already, I didn’t even start. I eventually, after avoiding all confrontations about it for half a year, and then being forced too, talked to my teacher. We actually made a new plan so I could finish it eitherway and it wouldn’t cost me my… exams, I still haven’t started.

Tests are coming up this week, haven’t started, and this is mostly new things, and I didn’t pay lots of attention in lessons so I can’t just “believe in myself” and miraculously pass.

Worst part? Even tho I don’t do any school work, I do still become unavailable the whole day because I’m planning on doing schoolwork, and then I just procrastinate, sleep, watch tiktok and everything bad that someone trying to do school shouldn’t. 

And I guess its probably like a tiktok addiction or something but at the same time, when I have no schoolwork I barely use tiktok and such, its only interesting when I am stressed about school. 

And people have helped me, they helped me make a planning, they helped me start the assignment but nothing ever works. NOTHING!! And even if there was a solution, I would just not even pursue it because my lazy ass is to fucking lazy for that. 

And I do such stupid shit when I’m stressed. I become incredibly annoying because I’m basically a class clown x100 with anyone who tries to interact with me, I become overly confident and also overly introverted. I start searching validation anywhere I can get, like dating apps and shit just because talking to borderline pedophiles is somehow the only way I can feel a little less stressed? 

I fucking hate it, feels like I’m destroying myself. I hate it even more that I barely have problems, like all the once I have are just like mental. My parents don’t hit me, I have not been SA’d or something, I don’t have suicide attempts, I don’t do self harm, I never went to a psych-ward, I don’t have friends who killed themselves before me, I really barely got problems compared to seemingly everyone, and yet they do so so much better than me.

This one girl, she says she has severe social anxiety, yet she seemingly knows everyone in school, everyone is always nice to her and stuff, and me, who doesn’t have such problems somehow performs so poorly socially. 

I just hate it all, I’m so gonna fucking fail school and my whole family is gonna be mad and I’ll never accomplish anything in life really. I feel like I should just kill myself, but dying seems scary and painful, but still, its such a easy way out of all this bullshit I’m creating.

18562,1hvi9m6,post,“THE NIGHT YOU’LL NEVER FORGET…” ,"⚠️⚠️TRIGGER WARNING FOR SA⚠️⚠️


My (25F) roommate “K” (27F) has begged me to go to the Rave concert in Orlando. She knows I’m from Florida but I’ve never been to an event like this. 

“EDC!!! You never heard of it! We have to go! This will be a great way to celebrate us getting a new apartment! It’ll be the night you’ll never forget!” She says excitedly.

“But we haven’t gotten accepted for the apartment yet. Shouldn’t we save our money? We never know if we will have to stay here.”

She smirks at me and says, “remember positivity! We’re gonna get accepted!”

I only knew this girl for 6 months and here we are now best friends that met at our planet fitness job. After struggles with my Ex-husband , she invited me to live with her in a town house her dad was renting out -although he stayed in California. We’ve been inseparable ever since. A few red flags here and there (to save you from reading a book I won’t say it unless you ask in the comments) but what “friendship” doesn’t. 

I uncomfortably smiled, “sure. Let’s do it.” 

——— November 10th, 2024 

She invited 2 of her best friends. One (We will call her “A”) lived in Las Vegas, and the other (We will call her “B”) lived in Florida. We all checked into the Orlando resort together happily and ready for the festivities. When getting in the room we all did our makeup for 3 hours , drunk fireball, and got dressed for the first night of the concert. Earlier we stopped at this vape shop and I bought some mushroom chocolate, so we all decided to eat a piece . Now the high wasn’t too bad but everyone reacts different …. Right? 

K (my roommate) started tweaking !! 

She started to look at her clothes and said she didn’t want to go out like that. (EVEN THOUGH SHE BOUGHT IT FOR THIS EVENT) She began to cry saying she didn’t want to go. 

“I look like a ho3!!”

We all assured her it was okay and that we can stay inside if she doesn’t feel better in a couple of hours. 
Well a couple of hours passed by and she said she still felt high. 

“I feel like someone in this room is angry with me.” 
She said staring at me.

Again, we all reassured her no one was mad and personally, I didn’t care - there was a big pool outside . I went downstairs and went half on some soup with A to give to K . Then me and A proceeded to go back downstairs to the bar and get in the pool while K stayed in the room with B. 


——— November 11th, 2024 

Same game plan. We did our makeup (no more drugs) but we drunk more fireball while getting ready. 

We left out to go to the event around 5 pm and danced the night away . I had so much fun! We held hands together and made sure everyone was by each other’s side. Who would’ve known the horror that would take place the next day…..

——— November 12th, 2024 

We all knew this was our last night before me, K, and A had to take a flight back to where we resided. 

“Let’s leave out early today.” A said 

We all did our routine , took more fireball shots and left out . 


*** 2 PM 

We make it and park the car and walked into the big event. Loud music roaring , a bunch of half naked people jumping up and down, and everyone dancing. 
I walked over to the concession stand to buy all of us one can of four loko. 

We toasted each other up to the sky dancing with a bunch of random people. 
I danced and danced … until 

*** unknown time 

I woke up on the ground completely submerged in the nighttime . A bunch of strangers stepping near me , I looked around for my friends. No where to be found. As I stood up I noticed my boots were off my feet . FU*K I JUST PAYED FOR THOSE!!! And my phone was missing. All I had was my purse that had my wallet. I walked around the humongous area because maybe by the grace of god they will see me! 

Still nothing. 

I walked over to the medical tent to tell a nurse I was completely lost . 

“Wait here. Maybe your friends will come looking for you.” 

I waited for an hour surrounded by a bunch of young girls crying , people doped up off of lord knows what - I started to get depressed . I can still find them myself ! I just have to get out of here and find the car!!! 


I walked out of the event barefoot for what seemed like forever . After walking the streets for about an hour I gave up. I started crying in the middle of the sidewalk. 

“What’s wrong?” A random group of strangers asked . 

I looked to see 3 guys and 2 females. Because of the females there , I felt safe. 

“I’m lost and I can’t find my friends.” I sobbed. 

“We can help you. Where are you staying?” One of the guys said. 

I looked in my wallet to find the key card to the resort. I hurriedly showed the group … “HERE! I’m staying here. Omg this is great.” 

“We will take you there.” 

I know it’s stupid … but I hopped in the car with them. 

“Hold on we gotta make a stop.” 

They dropped the girls off . Suddenly my heart started beating fast - but what could I do now? 

They took me to this random house …

“Get out.” 

I got out the car. 

“Sit down in the living room.”

By this point I’m sweating. Maybe if I do what they say they’d hurry up and take me back to the hotel. 

No. 

Three guys came in and they all raped me. 

The vivid events still cross my mind . How they all touched me and used me at the same time. When they were done 2 of the guys took me to the hotel . They knocked on the door . My roommate answered looking sleepy . 

“OMG ! WE WERE LOOKING EVERYWHERE FOR YOU.”

The guys said hey and left . 

Too afraid to say the events that happened I walked in sat on the bed and started busting out crying. I guess I was too loud because the police and a detective came knocking at the door. I told them what happened, They took my clothes , and told me to take a rape kit test. 

Oh my roommate had my phone by the way. I asked the girls if they’ve seen my phone … 

“I have it.” Said K 

It was 4 AM

I was completely locked out and had to make a new iCloud .

And then I went mute until it was time for me to catch my flight back to ATL. (Actually I went fully mute, psychotic, alcoholic breakdown for days) 

Once we made it back to ATL K gave me this bogus story days later ….

“Do you finally wanna talk about it?” She says as she sits on the carpet.

“Sure.” 

“We got raped two.” 

My eyes nearly bulged out my head

“Huh?” 

“A remembers being tied up to a bed and raped. She has bruises on her knees and scratches on her arm from fighting her attacker . We all blacked out and woke up in the medical tent with you.

“I never woke up in the medical tent.” 

“Well we were there.” 


Being gaslighted after this is insane . I moved away and sorta healed . I still cry about it from time to time . Relationships have been hard - i was abstinent for 7 months after until I started letting men have sex with me and use me without a real bond. I don’t know how to love properly anymore but I’m still striving to be better . 

To anyone out there - I just wanted to tell my story because Orlando police department never answered their phone after I made it back home and eventually I gave up and settled with the thought that I’ll never have justice . 

I have to remind myself … I’m still strong , I’m still loved - but I suffer with keeping anyone truly close to me . 

Future husband , I’m sorry if I’m too hard to deal with . I’m trying 

Thanks . ","“THE NIGHT YOU’LL NEVER FORGET…”  ⚠️⚠️TRIGGER WARNING FOR SA⚠️⚠️

I (28f) had a fwb-type situation with a guy (28m) that lasted for a little over a month. And it was great—we’d weirdly gone to the same school but never met, so we had these fun foundational connections; he had my exact humor so I just loved talking to him; the sex was great, and I really trusted him (I’ve been SA’d in the past). I fucked it up by having a kneejerk reaction to something he did and ending it when I really should’ve just talked to him about it because I know he would’ve been responsive. I tried walking it back, but no bueno. It’s probably for the best, though, because I think I was catching feelings and he was upfront from jump about not being in a place for something serious. 

I think about him a lot because I just can’t seem to let him go, but I doubt he’s thinking about me at all. I ended up deleting instagram off my phone because I became obsessive with seeing if he’d watched my story (and he had watched every one of my stories since we ended things) and then conflating that with him still being interested in me.

18564,1huqlqv,post,Should I say something after 5 months? ,"I (22f)  had a rough year. I stopped blocking mentally the SA perpetrared by my exboyfriend and another couple ones from other people, my childhood pet died and i couldn’t go back home to say goodbye and i was not the best partner and my boyfriend was going through some stress that lead us into more recurrent fights ( he was still there for me, it was nothing serious but it began to affect me because i started to feel there was something wrong there). Due to all of this happening my grades at college started to drop by a few points. I have always being the kind of person that is really strict about grades and it was hard trying to go one day at a time with everything that was happening but i started to feel unworthy, stupid and exagerated everytime i would breakdown. One day i felt really unmotivated and my best friend (21m) noticed, he naturally asked me what was going on and i tried to tell him the whole situation and how stressed, unmotivated and at days depressed i felt. I told him how it was getting hard for me to sleep and that i just wanted to sleep a whole week. He at the moment (and i think he still does) have been smoking weed almost everyday for a few months and he actually was even doing it on campus and going through classes like that. He lives with his parents and dont have to worry about a thing while i live alone, have an scholarship and pay rent, bills and all that. I never mind the difference and i tried to understand that he has different worries as me. But when i told him all that, he only answered that if i have tought about just smoking weed to stop stressing so much. I was really taken back by the answer to the point i dont really remember exactly what i answered i recall saying something like maybe or no,thanks. I didnt get mad and was just confussed. The conversation ended right there. I didn’t feel comfortable talking more about it and he didn’t seem to have anything else to say. I burried it in the back of my brain because i think the rest going on was taking enough mental space for me. 
This happened around 5 months ago and now i’m just thinking if that’s something you would say to a friend going through a rough time. To just smoke it out. I started to remember that i did feel unheard and a lack of empathy and he even giggle when he said it to me. I continued being friends with him but now remembering that i dont know if i have the right to say anything right now.

I told him how it was getting hard for me to sleep and that i just wanted to sleep a whole week. He at the moment (and i think he still does) have been smoking weed almost everyday for a few months and he actually was even doing it on campus and going through classes like that. He lives with his parents and dont have to worry about a thing while i live alone, have an scholarship and pay rent, bills and all that. I never mind the difference and i tried to understand that he has different worries as me. But when i told him all that, he only answered that if i have tought about just smoking weed to stop stressing so much. I was really taken back by the answer to the point i dont really remember exactly what i answered i recall saying something like maybe or no,thanks. I didnt get mad and was just confussed. The conversation ended right there. I didn’t feel comfortable talking more about it and he didn’t seem to have anything else to say. I burried it in the back of my brain because i think the rest going on was taking enough mental space for me. 
This happened around 5 months ago and now i’m just thinking if that’s something you would say to a friend going through a rough time. To just smoke it out. I started to remember that i did feel unheard and a lack of empathy and he even giggle when he said it to me. I continued being friends with him but now remembering that i dont know if i have the right to say anything right now.

18565,1huqbqf,post,Where does my responsibility end?,"Tinake over ng ate ko yung food business ni mama around 15 years ago. 

Mama is a generous person to a fault. 
Kung may bibili, lalagyan nya lagi ng “extra” kasi kamag-anak or nauutangan daw nya. 
Mangungutang sya kasi panreregalo daw sa apo nya. Ending, ayun pile of debt. 

We decided na si ate ang magtuloy ng business at kaming magkakapatid na ang mababayad ng utang nya tapos si mama, magstay na lang sa bahay since matanda na din naman sya. We will provide for her needs (food, groceries, meds and utilities). This is on top of the monthly allowance na binibigay ko every payday for her personal expenses. 

Long story short, nabayaran lahat ng utang (yay!).  The same business na nalubog sa utang, nakapagpa-graduate ng 2 out of 3 children ni ate at nakakabili ng wants nila. 
Noong na kay mama yung business, puro utang lang. 

So we thought everything was ok pero it turns out may mga bagong utang na naman daw si mama. 😭

Tinanong ko sya kung bakit sya nangungutang, I learned na dinedecline daw yung food na binibigay nila ate kasi gusto nya bumili/magluto ng sarili nya. 

Since gusto nya sya yung nagluluto, kinausap namin yung sa talipapa na kami magbabayad ng kukunin nya for herself. Akala ko ayos na. May ibang pinagkakautangan pa pala sya and to date, di ko alam yung iba kasi tinatago nya sakin. 

Tinry ko kausapin si mama pero ganun at ganun pa din nangyayari. Sasabihin niya, babayaran din daw nya. Ending, ako lang din lahat nagbabayad. 
Nag-aaway lang kami lagi to a point na ayaw ko na syang kausapin. 

Hanggang saan ba yung responsibility ng anak? ","Where does my responsibility end? Tinake over ng ate ko yung food business ni mama around 15 years ago.

18566,1hu84rb,post,Having issues getting over being the unwilling affair partner ,"Around 2 years ago, I started grad school and moved halfway across the country. It was a rough year and I was struggling both in grad school and coming out of a terrible relationship of sorts (SA and cheating and all sorts of bad stuff). About 5 months after moving I decided to try the dating scene again and matched with this dude on both Tinder and Hinge. Our parents were both from the same country (immigrant parents) and he really wanted to meet. I wasn't super amused with how he treated me: 30 min late to the first date, etc. but I think I was in a bad place and not thinking super straight. I also told him I was coming out of a really bad situation where I was SAed, gotten an STD, etc (that dude was a work of art). I was trying to treat this situation more like a hook-up and not get emotionally involved. I remember after the first time we hooked up, I was very insistent to go home and not spend the night at his place despite his protests. We continued to hook up for several months and he would more or less manipulate me into staying the night and make me coffee in the morning, but would also ghost me for weeks at a time. Lo and behold, about a few months in I was lurking on social media and found that he has a long-distance gf across the country. I called him out for it and he told me that I was crazy and controlling and treating him like a scumbag. He then proceeded to block me on social media and my number.

He moved across the country and his gf has moved in with him and I think they're planning on getting married soon. From what I learned on social media, the girlfriend's family loves him and they spend all the holidays together. Including posting very flattering things about them during the holiday season we were hooking up.

I met my current boyfriend a few months after this all went down and we've been dating for a bit now, however I still struggle with anger at this dude. Specifically about how I was characterized as the villain who accused him of cheating even though ""he's such a nice guy"" and that I was crazy and insane. I feel like I let myself be taken advantage of when I was in a really vulnerable spot and he got off scot free without any repercussions. I'm not sure what I expect to get from posting this on Reddit but I think it helps to internet rant. I also still see some of their mutual friends in town and in grad school, but they have no clue that any of this happened obviously.","Having issues getting over being the unwilling affair partner  Around 2 years ago, I started grad school and moved halfway across the country.

18567,1hu5or4,post,I need advice about my friend group.,"Hello Reddit,
I (23 male) have a close friend group from high school. We started as a group of 4 boys, then it expanded into a bigger group. The core boys know each other for more than 10 years. My recent problem started 5 years ago, when one girl, C invited another girl to a house party, let’s call her R. We all drunk too much, and R and I drunkenly kissed once. Well it was awkward and unpleasant for both of us, but being a man I apologized to her, and she forgave me, or so I thought. Fast forward to nowadays, R has been recently engaged to T, one of the 4 core boys. They started dating about a year after the drunken kiss incident. A year ago the friend group’s get togethers were less and less frequent, and basically I haven’t seen them in half a year. In December 2024 I asked one of them about his New Year’s Eve party plans and he said that they’re planning. Well it turned out they created a messenger group without me for a completely different reason, and it became their main messenger group. And the reason? A year ago R confessed to everyone that I kissed her at her first party with us, and she hated me for that ever since. I don’t get it. It happened 5 years ago, we were both drunk and it just happened, there was no SA or something like that. And after the incident R came to our parties without letting me know that she holds grudges. Well, I texted R about this and she’s ghosting me. Others from the group said it wasn’t really about R, but C. Apparently she hates me for my political views, and she’s trying to excommunicate me from the friend group. R and C are besties, so I assume C is pulling the strings. The two other guys from the core of 4, is trying to convince T and R to choose me over C, because we all know that one can’t rely on C, because of her attitude, developed in recent years. And additionally she owes a lot of money to T.

I don’t know what to do. It is a fucked up situation. I don’t want to lose my best friends (the 3 other guys) but if they choose C over me, I will let them go. ","I need advice about my friend group. Hello Reddit,

18568,1htfn7f,post,My bf and I had intercourse 5 years ago. It bothers me and my friends suggest possible rape.,"My mom, whom I still love, is a not so nice person who would manipulate and gaslight me to the point where I felt like I was losing my sanity so l avoided going home at all costs.

I was a Junior in HS and my friend has a brother who is a year older than me and was in his senior year at the time. I would hang out with him and slowly develop a crush on him. I messaged him one day I liked him but he texted back he just wanted to be friends. Over the next few months I came to terms that it was okay that he did not like me and I was fine with being his friend and just being a supportive person. I did not want to ruin our relationship we developed as friends.

Five years ago today, I went up to his room to hang out as usual. I usually just sit on his bed looking at my phone to pass the time while he sits at his computer playing video games. This time he was laying in his bed in the dark but he sounded like he was going to take a nap. I did not feel like going back downstairs and just wanted some silent company as per usual. He suggested I stay and sit on his chair that sat next to the window that let in some evening dusk light.

I sat there for 10-15 min trying to close my eyes and take a nap. I could not see him because the room was so dark but I knew he was in his bed. He said from the darkness on his side of the room that I could recline the chair which I then did.

Another 15-20 min pass and I think he is asleep but I can't tell with how dark it is. He then says I could lay in his bed since there is room and he could move over. I was relieved with the idea since the chair was very uncomfortable to try to take a nap in. I get up and slowly move to the bed and I can hear him shuffle over to make room on the full size bed. I feel for the comforter and proceed to get in the bed. I thought to myself that being this close to him was fine bc we were old
acquaintances. I had convinced myself to believe we would only be friends from then on. I laid there flat on my back trying to fall asleep. Another 15 or so minutes go by and out of nowhere he gets on top of me and sticks his tongue in my mouth. I start freaking out as he moves his tongue around and he grinds on top of me. I laid there like a dead fish. I'm asking myself what is going on and I can't come to terms with the reality of the situation. He groped me through my bra then makes his way to grabbing the bottom of my shirt to move it up. I squirm back and stutter if he could give me a second. He moves up and I get up and walk out of the room.

I go downstairs and have the first panic attack I ever had. I text my childhood friend after I somewhat recollect myself after hyperventilating.
She comes downstairs with her bf at the time and asks me what happened. Her bf is kinda cheering me on bc he was shipping me and her brother. I hesitate on what to say and decide to just open a bottle of some 5% sugary alcoholic beverage in the fridge and sit on the couch. She puts on tv and asks me what I want to watch. Eventually I tell her that her what happened and how I'm extremely confused about why that happened. She could I was extremely uncomfortable and I can’t remember what she said exactly but she said it wasn’t right that he touched me without permission.

The next morning news gets around and her parents are trying to convince me to date the brother since he is a good guy while I'm asking about what was going through his head and explain how uncomfortable I was.

Another day goes by and I keep asking myself a ton of unanswered questions. His sister, my friend, tells me I need to talk to him and pushes me into his room and walks away. I stand there awkwardly and he glances over at me and goes back to playing games. I slowly walk over to the bed and sit down. My thoughts and questions are going at a million miles per hour. It's impossible for me to have to courage say or ask anything. He stops playing and says with his back turned to me in his chair ""I guess we are dating then."" Now l'm even in more shock and confusion.
I stutter ""uh.. okay."" He goes back to playing games and I then get up and walk out.

I feel more confused than ever. Asking myself if I missed something in his advances that day or over the past few months. We barely spoke to each other even when we hung out. I liked his company so I did not feel alone but I did not understand why he pounced on me out of nowhere.

Later that evening I mustered up to courage to go to his room again in hopes of clearing up some of my questions. I sit on his bed in confusion and struggling to say anything. He is playing video games and shortly after get up and turns off the lights and lays down. I lay down awkwardly and think about what to say and ask. But idk when or how but he basically did the same thing as before and was trying to take off my clothes. I think he got my shorts off. I felt very uncomfortable when I felt his dick through his pants rub on me. I laid there like a dead fish cursing myself for putting myself into the same predicament. He stood up at the foot of the bed and asks ""Do you want to have sex."" I say nothing. I'm thinking about 'is it wrong of me to say no. Maybe this is okay and I'm just not comfortable bc l've never done this before. Why is he doing this? Did I miss advances before this. Do I not look extremely uncomfortable to him. I still don't say a thing. He says ""I'll take that as a 'yes' then"" and opens up a condom. I ask myself 'what is going on and is this really happening to me right now. Could I have said no? What is he thinking? Should I have said yes? I don't really feel comfortable right now. This seems kinda fast?' He has the condom on and takes off my underwear that then hang at the ankles of my feet. I barely move from laying on the bed and because I did not move he had trouble getting back on the bed. He put it inside and moved back and forth slowly getting faster. I laid there in silence but maybe it was so dark so he could not tell how uncomfortable I was. He finished and got up and left. I laid there awkwardly and questioning if I did the right thing or if I should have said yes or no. He came back with a towel and tossed it to me. I felt
uncomfortable to wipe or clean myself in front of him. I did not move from that bed the whole night.

I think I recall him playing video games after and eventually going to bed next to me. I wake up the next morning which was the first day back to school. I go to school and see some of my guy friends. I tell them what happened and one asks me if I enjoyed it. I said ""I guess. I don't know what to make out of it."" Later that day I notice my friend's brother never came to class and was too
""sick"" to come in. I thought 'how convenient h happens to not come to school' sarcastically t myself. I act like nothing happens over days and weeks and act like we are still friends before.

18570,1ht0j2q,post,Gow with the flow.,"First of all gusto ko lang mag apologize if ever you encounter my wrong grammer or spelling and I hope I'll recieve good comments 🥹.

Tagal ko na po itong kinikim. I have 2 sisters and when I was a kid I am type of introverted kid. I study at Indian International school elementary we where at saudi that time. I always used to hear from them sinasabi na pangit daw ako and I should go away with them. I tried to make friends meron isa pero fake friend. Isang Indian girl and she always ask for money and If I don't give it to her she will dump me. One time I gave her money and thankyou siya and umalis at iniwan niya ako sa classroom. Pumunta ako sa playground and I saw her talking about me how she manipulate me. I feel betrayed and hurt when she saw me she don't even care. Umuwi na ako luhaan kasi making friends is so difficult for me.

In home si lola nag aalaga saamin because our parents are bot busy working and even siya nag aalaga samin may favortism siya which is my bunso kapatid. Everytime we had a talk or playtime with her lola used to beat us up (me and 2nd sister) and telling we don't have to play with her kasi baka sasaktan to the point sometimes we get bruises and pag uwi nila mama at papa. Lola and mom used to fight dahil why we get our bruises and unfair treatment. Everytime may party (Eid)  kasama ko sila lola, mom, dad and my sisters. Lola used to talk about how I was a bad child tamad and not loving sister and abusive sister (she is referring that I've abused my little sister which is not true). The kids same as my age at the time didn't want to friend us because they thought we are wierd. All the words coming from lola really hurts my feelings kasi bakit niya pa kailangan sirain  pa kami sa ibang tao when we didn't even hurt our sister when lola literally abused us and get our bruises. Mas lalo nag create yung pagka mahiyain ko because lola hate me the most than 2nd and bunso.

Whenever our relatives visits us all we hear lola and them talk about us. Kasi maliit lng home we can really hear them na kahit maguindanao language ginagamit nila naintindihan namin. Everyday I felt im such a loser ganito ba talaga ako they talk about how I am a bad child and I do nothing just listening.

In our highschool time we were enrolled at Philippine International School. I got good classmate but I still don't have a friend and that time I don't know how study not until went there and learned how. My classmate parents and my parents are good friends. So pagka uwi ko kahit ipakita ko report card ko kahit 80+ lang yun I was happy for my achievement but my parent are not that happy. ""Bakit hindi mo ginalingan tingnan mo anak ni ___ always top. Magka classmate pa naman kayo."" I really tried my best but my best wasn't good enough for them until I reached college. 

Sa philippines ako nag college. Tourism kinuha kong course which kasi sabi nila maganda (Which I regret kasi introverted ako). I met my 1 true friend and only one. I also met my ex-boyfriend. I thought he was the one because he was so sweet, he gave me flowers and  pay for every date and 1 thing that made things complicated he was christian and I was muslim. We had our struggles and one time. I was not happy seeing him happy talking to my classmate na babae kahit kasama ko siya(Me, him and her only sa classroom) I felt I was left out. It's been hours and they're still talking. We weny home walking and we had our fight. He's telling me that ""OA ko masyado"" and left me alone. One time nag aayus kami ng event venue. He bought water and gave it to that girl (that we been fighting for months) I saw it on my own eyes and after ininum ni girl yung water, kinuha ni ex and he drink the same bottle and pag ka uwi namin we had our fight again. I had my depression and everyone at school thinks I was OA kasi nag share ako ng problema and no one is on my side except that 2 friend of mine and 1 professor that carw about me. Napansin nila bumaba grade ko and hindi na ako pumapasok sa school. Hindi ko sinabi sa parents ko yung problema ko and went to computer shop para mag PUBG just to forget my problem nung hindi ko na kinaya yung problema ko kasi I had no one to talk to and I don't want yo share my problems sa least friend ko kasi ayaw ko ma feel pabigat ako and that time hindi na ako lumalabas ng kwarto. I woke up 7pm and sleep 12pm and my parent got worried and brought me to psychiatrist. I had my anti-depressant medicine. 

When dad came into my room and sinira niya yung door and hugged me and say he's sorry and gave me advice. I can't help but cried all my pain. I was thinking why I am like this and why am I being left out and I felt no one loves me. I had very very low self-esteem and I have 0 confidence. Lahat ng sinabi ni lola nung nabubuhay siya sabi niya sakin pinag dadasal niya na hindi ako magkaroon ng magandang buhay. My mom, my ex and relatives was all over my head.

She was 16 and was 8 when I first met her with the best of my knoweldge. She would play with me and my brother like pretending to be a jellyfish from spongebob since she brought VHS tapes from shows you would watch at that time since it's 2004. The only time she got angry is when we got too touchy with her. We visited her family where I got introduced to her brother who I thought was super cool. He had classic ps2 games like midnight club 2, gta SA, and tony hawk. Her brother joked if he wanted us to play GTA SA and my babysitter said since she was very protective with the media she wanted us to see like violent video games since my brother and I could only play E games at the time or flash games me and my brother would play behind our parents back. My babysitter and her brother parents we're friends to my father since she was a student at the school my dad was or maybe not but still my memory is fuzzy. She gave me a positive outlook on woman and I did see her again when I was 13ish and never saw anything in her that sparked anything in my head that we're naughty. Even now I can't think of her like that since I have standards to see a girl I saw as my hero that I saw as a big sister figure to me doing that. So years later I play video games to random friends of mine or whatever about my past babysitter and her brother I could remember at the time. Father overhears my discussion. He tells me that my babysitter brother died from drug overdose. He explains to me that he was friends with a group of people that we're part of a bad crowd. He hangsout with them to a point where he overdoses. I'm not sure it was a overdose but I do know it was a case that's related to drugs. I felt devestaed hearing that. Don't know how my babysitter is doing now but I hope the best for her.","My babysitter brother died from taking drugs pier pressured by friends So this is about by babysitter who I look back with a positive light.

18572,1hss75e,post,I am loosing my mother again,"I (19f) have never been the first choice for my mom, when I was just 9 years old she decided we should move from my home country all the way to a different continent, away from my father my grandparents and all my friends. I was alone for most of my childhood, got severe anxiety and abandonment issues and landed in a teenie abusive relationship which ended in SA.
I landed in a handful of psychiatries, rehab, group homes and a crazy amount of doctors. It's taken years to mend the relationship to her, and now after my physical health took a turn for the worst I am back living at her house.
The issue? She's got a boyfriend, a man she met around one year ago, and it's ruining everything we worked so hard to achieve. He doesn't work, doesn't clean and only cooks around twice a week max even though he promised to be a 'house husband' thanks to not working. He has a history of drug abuse (still actively an alcoholic and pothead) and even though he loves my mother he is in my opinion an as*hole.
He has 4 kids, all disabled and extremely spoiled, I won't go into detail but the eldest (m17) has made my life a living hell by being constantly loud, downright rude and absolutely unwilling to talk about issues, to the point of leaving my cat physically ill from stress.
Now, on Christmas Eve everything escalated to the point of my mother almost breaking up with him, yet they talked things out (no real changes, only empty promises as always from him) and I gave her an ultimatum.
Either he leaves, or I do.
Now I know full well that I am 19 years old, I could get my own place, but speaking financially and psychologically with my history neither of us feel I am ready. She settled on a one week long deadline to make a decision and honestly I already know the answer.
I won't be the choice, I will have to leave.
Fair enough, her house, her life, but knowing that a one year relationship with a druggie is more important to her than her own flesh and blood..? Yeah, the thought of it is breaking me. My anxiety is worse than ever, my depression is back and I barely think anymore, only running on autopilot at work and sobbing at night. I hate it, hate being the second choice for the woman who should love and cherish me more than anything else.
Worst of all, I tried to make it work. I fed his kids when he was sick, babysat, helped with homework, cleaned etc etc but after a while of being treated without any respect at all and not receiving any thanks at all I gave up.
He's 40+ ffs, not 14.
I do not know how I will afford my own place, I don't have a license either so I am basically fucked. If I move out, I will go no contact.

for context: my ex 23m and i 22f dated for two and a half years until spring 2023. i met my current bf 23m fall of 2023. we've been basically together since.

my ex and i stayed friends after we broke up, we do favors for eachother occasionally (he's helped me move/get groceries etc. were neighbors and also were both in college, he has a car and i don't and neither do my friends so it's convenient). we don't see eachother to hang out really but will catch up on/after the errands. i would ask my bf to help but he works long hours so he never really can. i don't really mention that my ex helps me out unless it comes up but i've never lied about it nor do i feel like i'd need to. he's never said anything or reacted negatively. we have a strong relationship and i think he understands that i truly love him and have a platonic relationship with my ex.

thanksgiving of 2023 me and my current bf were exclusive and i had no intention of cheating at all. i was spending it at a friendsgiving and got ridiculously drunk. im not a lightweight but i truly had 5-10 shots which is a lot for me and i barely remember the night. long story short i ended up at my ex's, and to this day i don't know why. i think i asked to pick up weed from him from the party. my friends told me not to go but he always gave it to me for free so i said fuck it and he picked me up.

long story short i wake up in his bed and ask him if we had sex. he said yes. i had no memory of it or desire to do that at any point in the night. i can't even remember if i initiated. he was also sober and it's makes me feel sick when i think about the fact that i was literally blackout. i told him a while later that he probably shouldn't have done that and it was a brief awkward conversation. he said he felt gross about it.

because i had no memory of the event i kept forgetting to hold it against him and we resumed our normal dynamic. i never told my bf what happened. i got tested before i had sex with him again. he's kind and im not worried about his reaction but im worried he'll feel i cheated and it's even harder to explain given that me and my ex are friendly and he knows this. i don't even really understand that myself and i don't know if it's normal/okay.

it's been a while but it still eats at me sometimes. i still debate telling him. ","not sure if i cheated on my bf TW: SA

18575,1hrz1if,post,Going to kill my dad,"He is such a self centered piece of shit to the point I feel like permanently getting rid of him. All my life he was never there and was to invested in work, even when he came home I never got to see him cuz he’d be in his room doing paperwork and other bs to pay any attention to me.

There was a moment where I was being interrogated by the cops due to SA that happened to me, he cared for one day. everything else after that was back to normal.

He cheated on my mother for 5 YEARS WITH MY FRIENDS MOTHER, it was talk of the whole fucking school. I kept trying to brush it off as rumour.

He gets drunk and angry and blames everyone else around him for why he’s so miserable even though he does this to himself but he just such a fucking caveman he thinks he’s always right. He thinks the only way to fix things is the break it more, which brings me to the marriage.

Mom wants to get a divorce or just separation papers because we can’t deal with him anymore, to combat this, dads doing the absolute greasiest things imaginable to make our lives hell

 He keeps drunk harassing mom saying how much he misses her and wishes things would work out, but he’s also taking most of our payment/insurance plans and canceling them because he claims he shouldn’t have to, keep in mind my mother is disabled and can’t work and I’m the only one capable of working anymore

He even went as far as to make fraudulent separation papers for mom to sign so he can buy us out of the fucking house

When mom refused to sign he lost it and now our internet has been cut out, next is gonna be the car. After that who knows, but if we lose this house I’m killing dad, I’m ready to throw my life away to make sure he doesn’t have the rest of his, he’s done enough to us","Going to kill my dad He is such a self centered piece of shit to the point I feel like permanently getting rid of him. All my life he was never there and was to invested in work, even when he came home I never got to see him cuz he’d be in his room doing paperwork and other bs to pay any attention to me.

There was a moment where I was being interrogated by the cops due to SA that happened to me, he cared for one day. everything else after that was back to normal.

He cheated on my mother for 5 YEARS WITH MY FRIENDS MOTHER, it was talk of the whole fucking school. I kept trying to brush it off as rumour.

He gets drunk and angry and blames everyone else around him for why he’s so miserable even though he does this to himself but he just such a fucking caveman he thinks he’s always right. He thinks the only way to fix things is the break it more, which brings me to the marriage.

Mom wants to get a divorce or just separation papers because we can’t deal with him anymore, to combat this, dads doing the absolute greasiest things imaginable to make our lives hell

 He keeps drunk harassing mom saying how much he misses her and wishes things would work out, but he’s also taking most of our payment/insurance plans and canceling them because he claims he shouldn’t have to, keep in mind my mother is disabled and can’t work and I’m the only one capable of working anymore

He even went as far as to make fraudulent separation papers for mom to sign so he can buy us out of the fucking house

When mom refused to sign he lost it and now our internet has been cut out, next is gonna be the car. After that who knows, but if we lose this house I’m killing dad, I’m ready to throw my life away to make sure he doesn’t have the rest of his, he’s done enough to us",1,10,2025-01-02 17:26,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1hrz1if/going_to_kill_my_dad/,Neutral

18577,1hri6yz,post,I don't think I can ever be happy ,"TW: SA / S*De/ SH

I'm embarrassed to say anything. I just came in, I see so many tragic stories. I feel like I shouldn't say anything, but if I delete this now it won't mean anything.
I hate the feeling of indifference, I don't talk to anyone, not for fear of being judged, it's because I know how it's going to be, and I hope to challenge my own experience once again and show myself that I am appreciated and listened to and care. to people but I'm so tired of trying that I don't feel like it. 
I have never felt appreciated.
I have never felt loved and I feel so alone observing how it is different for everyone. 
I have nothing, and every time I think it's going to be different I end up in the same situation but more exhausted. I'm tired. I'm tired of continuing to try to make my life have meaning. In exactly one month I turn 22 years old. I'm young, right?
I think every day that I still have time for everything to be different. That at some point something will make sense but for as long as I can remember I've been thinking that the next year everything will be better. And it never gets better. And it hurts me to admit that I blamed myself. ""It's my fault because I haven't made an effort to make something change,"" so I thought about ""starting to live,"" that's what I called it in my head.
Say what I think, act, do everything
sit. But, I've just found that it hurts more now, everything. Because I no longer feel hidden. I no longer feel that I am sunk and do not want to improve, now I see that I am sunk and that being an open book, no one cares. It has always hurt me to be insignificant, but I am. And I have never needed approval but if I have never had it, it starts to hurt to want to feel it.

Sorry, if you keep reading you'll think I just threw up a bunch of thoughts, and it's true. I don't know what to say or how to start, but I would like to feel that my mark remains somewhere.
I keep having hurtful memories and they are becoming more and more present. My whole life has been disgusting, everyone I've ever been close to has completely ruined me. I have allowed things that many people would never allow. I can't trust anyone because they've always ended up being horrible and I've stopped believing that anything will ever work. Everyone has played with me and I am very tired. It's like I can never start again. 
I can't stop thinking about what I would write if I chose that I was going to die. I can't stop thinking about how I would do it and where it would be so as not to bother anyone. I'm tired of continuing to try and seeing how every month and year that passes that I try to be happy and show myself that I can get ahead, I see how the lives of others get better and in the face of adversity they receive love. I'm envious, I feel trash, I don't feel worthy of anything and I've been knowing for some time that I'm not going to live much longer. 
Yesterday, January 1, I cut myself again after a few months trying to avoid it. My body is a mess and totally full. 
I feel totally incapable of feeling well forever. 

All the people I have ever loved have screwed me over, or despised me, or taken advantage of me, mistreated me, hit me, drugged me, tried to kill me, robbed me, defamed me, ridiculed me, or abused me. sexually, I didn't think I would come to know all the types of violence from people I have trusted. I wish something in my life had felt right or been true. I feel like such an idiot every day of my life, I'm a joke to everyone, I can't take it anymore. Seriously, I can't anymore, and I wish I could think differently. I wish I could believe that everything will be okay. I can't stand it, I can't stand being alive. Every day I feel worse.

18579,1hrfpuf,post,My partner's family is crumbling again,"There are two major points to this so I apologize if this goes on a bit long but both of these are issues that occurred in the last 48 hours. Additional apologies for any errors as I am on mobile. (Minor TW for SA mention and alcoholism)

My partner (28M) and I (25F) stayed overnight last night, NYE, as his mom's house in the VA mountains. Mid-November, Mom (C) and her partner (G) (both mid-60s, F & M) took in one of G's grandkids, J (14F). The last time we had seen J was when she was 10 as she stayed with them for a summer before returning to New York. Over those 4 years, her life has been a hard road between an uncaring family and being SA'd. The reason C & G came to take her in was because her family in NY no longer wanted her there. Naturally as a troubled teen she was acting out and her family wanted nothing to do with it. 

Thanksgiving was a shitshow. J spent a night in the county jail due to trying to fight with C. J's Biomom came up from Florida, so knew what happened and had been seeing her during the holiday week. Thanksgiving day, county called and said J needed to be taken back by a certain time or else BM would be charged with child abandonment. BM was more upset at the threat of the charge rather than concern over her kid. J was retrieved, and the rest of the day was tense. 

We didn't see C, G, or J for about a month until Christmas. J seemed to be doing a lot better, she'd have an episode here or there and lash out, but C & G have made sure she's safe, warm, fed and loved (even if it's a hard love with discipline). Partner and I even sat with her and painted ornaments bc she wanted to use the new paints she got and asked if anyone would paint with her. It was a nice evening. 

NYE, prior to our arrival, J had a bad episode and lashed out again. Between her, C, & G it got physical, not bad. But hands were laid. She spent the last 24 hours cooped up in her room. Food was brought up to her, she was checked on to make sure she was still safe. But she locked herself in her room. Talking to (at?) her today, we could tell she was a shell of what she was prior. C mentioned she'd had a fight over the phone with her grandmother in NY. Tomorrow C & G are looking at therapy for her because she needs more help than the family can give. She never came downstairs, but she sat at the top of the stairs. She wouldn't look anyone in the eyes. 


At the same time, this morning we got a call from my partner's older sister L. She was letting us know that something had happened with their dad and no one knew where he was, just that he was safe. Dad's brother had his wallet, keys, and phone. Their dad has a bad history of alcoholism and relapsed multiple times over 2023-2024. He was struggling again at Thanksgiving and was found passed out in the bathroom. His second wife has also not been much help, often sweeping the rehab stays under the rug and not telling the family.  On our way out around 5 we got more info from L- dad was at a behavioral center. He's safe, but needed more than just help with his alcohol problem. My partner is planning to write his dad a long letter about his true feelings before he goes to see him when he's allowed to. 

In the end I'm just happy that both parties are safe to some degree. Both parties are in the process of getting help. I am just currently emotionally drained because I'm watching my partner relive a part of his past he hasn't wanted to see again. I'm also planning on writing 2 letters, one for J and one for my partner's dad. With any luck I won't cry too hard while trying to do so. What a fucking way to start the new year.

Sobrang mataas ang pangarap nilang dalawa in a good way naman. Silang dalawa gusto nilang magwork sa ibang bansa. May tiwala ako sa kanila kasi magagaling sila. Nasa ibang bansa na sila ngayon. Ako naiwan sa Pilipinas. Don’t get me wrong po. Masaya ako pra sa kanila. Sobra ang support ko sa kanila. Ipinagmamalaki ko silang dalawa, lagi ko silang ikinukwento sa ibang friends ko. Sobrang yabang kong sinasabi na “ mga bff ko yung mga yun.” So to the cut the story short, nakita ko nagpost ang isa sa kanila. Magkasama na sa iisang work. Nang makita ko yung post. Sobrang saya ko pero at the same time bigla akong nasaktan, nalungkot na feeling ko, “Aww buti pa sila.” Na-feel ko yung sakit kasi silang dalawa magkasama na, ako nandito pa rin. Normal lang ba talaga yung ganitong pakiramdam? 
Gusto ko silang batiin ng happy new year pero nahihiya na ako kasi baka umiyak lang ako.

18581,1hqdbqp,post,I had a huge fight with my roommate ,"So me and my friend live together, she’s 26 and i just turned 20, we work together in a hostel for lgbt teens at risk (teens with hard background who got throw out of their home because of their sexuality/gender/risky behaviors but they are lgbt…) English is not my first language so I’m sorry in advance 

Anyway, we live together because we wanted to rent an apartment and be closer to the hostel in case of emergency (we are both guidances there), lately she’s been doing a lot of drugs (past 3 months) and in the last year she’s been really sick(coughing so hard till she vomits) , the thing is- she’s refusing to take care of herself, she’s always asking me to take her to the doctor and help her make an appointment (we had to go to the er because of her coughing the night before my birthday)
So at the start I was like- okay she’s my friend and I love her but in the last two months I had enough, I told her that she’s my friend and I’m not her doctor or her therapist (it was a nice conversation not attacking or something, I asked her few things and she told me she think she’s always seeking for someone who will take care of her)

Anyway!!! Sorry for all the blubbering, in the last 6 months she refuses to clean the house, we have 4 cats (I have 2 and she has the other 2), she doesn’t clean their sand box or washing the floor or cleaning after her friends come over or her dishes and she always have another excuse (she’s sick, she went to a party, she’s done drugs so she needs to rest, sometimes and most of the time they are valid, but it’s a like the past 6 months! There was one time that she got sa’d, I went right to the apartment and canceled my job to be with her, I try my best I really do…)

So I’ve tried talking to her about it and she got really mad, at first she said I wasn’t nice to her or caring enough. Last Saturday I came with my boyfriend to the apartment after three days I wasn’t there and it was terrible, the smell was awful and she didn’t cleaned after her because she was sick and went to her mother. I was really angry and she just turned it against me saying I wasn’t considerate

Idk what to do, she’s leaving the apartment in one week (my boyfriend moves in😚) but our relationship was so important to me and she’s just throwing it in the trash. I don’t think I need to apologize but I feel awful.
She wrote me a pretty violent message saying “week because you’re overacting I’m just letting you know I won’t be cleaning out apartment at all and if you want it to be clean clean everything yourself” (like it’s not the current situation🤨😞) anyway I feel really guilty about this and I’m trying to shake it off
But it really weights on my heart

(i’m also online schooled so i don’t have very many friends my age.) the most i have ever done “sexually” is with the guy i mentioned that SAed me, (he is 7 years older than me btw) the family friend has said that we won’t do anything until i’m of age, but the little touches still make me uncomfortable/feel dirty. it’s not his fault but i don’t know how to tell him i don’t really want to be with him. even tho i’m “mature for my age” i’m still a teenager and want to do teenager things and maybe even experience teenage love? but whenever we talk about “us” and i say something like “but you’ve experienced being a teenager in love” etc. he’s said something like “you’re not missing out on anything” or “you’d be better of waiting until your older to date.” even tho he has a point i just think our age gap is weird right now, i don’t know why a 20 year old would want to be romantically involved with a 15 year old. some of the things he says also gives me a bad feeling, i feel safe around him i just don’t like how much more experienced he is, he has the upper hand and i don’t want to be trapped in a relationship with him. i feel guilty because i feel like im leading him on and i feel dirty bc of the age gap. i also feel like he’ll expect me to have s€x once i’m of age and i don’t know when i’ll be ready for that. my main concern is throwing away the little childhood i have left, i’m about to turn 16 and i want to enjoy being a teenager, is that bad? should i not date anyone and wait until i’m 18 to date this guy? what if i waste my teenage years waiting for someone thats not even gonna work out? he’s not a bad guy or creepy by any means and he has said many times before i’m too young and many family members are “shipping” us. what do i do?

18585,1hpcf90,post,I’ve Never Wanted to Cheat More,"I have an emotionally taxing job. I won’t say too much, but it’s been a genuinely traumatic year in terms of what I’ve seen.

My partner has been an emotional wreck due to some career changes (we’re in different fields). Every day I do my best to comfort them and build them up but they’re invariably sad again later.

Earlier yesterday they kept touching my genitals. I was tired and not in the mood, so I moved their hands away. They kept touching me. Then they took off my underwear. I relented and we had sex, despite not wanting to. Then we stopped because I wasn’t into it. Then they cried because, in their words, they had “raped” me. I then had to comfort them. Then they broke down over something completely different. All this before I had to go into work. I’ve been SA’ed before, so this sort of triggered me, but I took an edible when I got home and got over it.

I feel like I’m in a constant vortex of sadness in which their suffering is so heavy and deep that nothing else matters. I don’t want to abandon them in this state because I do care but it has me starved for something fun and exciting. Which is why I want to cheat.

I’d never do it. But I do have dreams almost every night where I have sex with someone else. Then I wake up to them telling me that they’ve never been happier with anyone else, that they’re a failure, etc.","I’ve Never Wanted to Cheat More I have an emotionally taxing job.

18587,1hns44x,post,Partner’s way of “physical touch” is irritating me,"I love my partner. And I love physical touch. It’s actually my number one love language. But Idk what’s happening to me. And Idk if it has something to do with me being SA’d as a kid but every time my partner decides to be lovey dovey, he does it in HIS way, which now irritates me. 

- He likes to be physical with me by groping my boobies all the time. And yes. sometimes it’s fun and it feels good to know that he likes them. But there are times where I just get very “overstimulated” cause I wouldn’t be in the mood then he won’t listen to me. And would take it personally. He would get upset that I got upset. And then I’m the bad person. 


- He also likes to put his arm around my shoulder when were walking. Which is difficult, cause were almost the same height so the levels would be the same and it looks all weird. And feels all weird too cause now I feel like his weight is on my shoulders. I told him I didn’t like that. He removed it. But kept doing it. I did it to him too just to spite him. He said he didnt like it. I told him thats exactly how I feel! But he kept. doing. it. Once he did it again, I snapped and aggressively removed his arm around me. And he got mad cause he felt as if I embarrassed him. IN MY DEFENSE, we wouldn’t have come to that point if it werent my 4th time telling him I didn’t like it. He said that “cause sometimes you don’t mind”. In my defense, again, it’s just because i felt so overstimulated that time and I reached my breaking point. 

I just want to be caressed and be intimate with him in an INTIMATE way. Without the boobs and the weight. Now the idea of being physical with someone without those sounds so good and I’m longing for it. I ask him for a massage but you can feel that he’s not up for it but does it anyway.

as i was sick as a child, i would obviously struggle mentally compared to other children my age, which would have been perfectly okay with me! just simple anxiety in my mind i guess. but the people who were meant to look after me destroyed my life. when i was 9-11 i was sa by a teacher, i never told anyone until i was 17, whilst i was passing away from an overdose (i survived!! i’m very happy lol)
i made friends, however my closest friend did similar things to me, possibly worse- i won’t go into details. 
my ex-bf ran with all of this information, i was simply just someone he could abuse over and over, in every way. he would threaten to take his own life if i refused. i was raped and beaten for a year. when i broke up with him, he walked into incoming traffic infront of me. (didn’t die (unfortunately i guess LMAO)) 
currently i’m dealing with everything as it all piles up on me. 
constant physical pain from arthritis, worsened by seizures. constant anxiety from the fear of seizures or low blood sugar. cptsd and bpd, countless other complications i can’t even be bother to go into, but i am such a burden because all of this. 
people say that i didn’t deserve it, sure, but i don’t care. i hate myself. 
i want to kill myself for how i ripped my family apart. i took away the support from my sister when she was sitting her exams because i got sick. i don’t care if it was my fault, it impacted her so much. i ruined my brothers birthday after a seizure. i have missed so many beautiful and special events because i am who i am. 
my boyfriend met me and ‘liked me’ and now he is stuck with me. what i come with. 

and most of all, my poor mother. she has been my rock ever since i was born. when i was a constantly sick baby, a sick toddler. i’m constantly sick- i ruined EVERYTHING for her. she was doing a degree when she had to drop out because i was sick. i adore her so much, i just wish i was never born. i imagine her with my sister and my brother, them being so happy. so beautiful all together. laughing on them promenade with ice creams, so happy as the sun shines on them. why should i be here? i’ve tried over 20 times to leave- why should i stay? i bring so much misery i can’t stand it","i am a burden in every way I want to make this as short as i can, even if there is a lot lol.

Pati tomato sauce, mayonaise na nasa ref napapansin nakalagay naman ng maayos. Pati niluto na nakastock(obviously nasa ref para hindi mabulok and makain ulit next time). Pati nakastock na softdrinks nung pasko lang naman binili and hindi lang mainom kasi sa labas kami kumakain lage ng jowa ko kasi panay aya kumain sa labas, pinuna. Minsan pati sa kwarto namin nakikialam. Mahilig siya magcomment sa bahay and buhay ng ibang tao.

Sinagot ko jowa ko na paanong maglalawa yan e nakasara yung tubig and hindi lang naman ako yung umiinom ng tubig ko. kanina lang uminom ako, maayos naman wala namang tulo. And sa tomato sauce, malamang nakastock yan jan para gamitin ko next time na kailangan ko. Alangan naman araw araw ako magluto ng may tomato sauce? Pati sa coke, sinabe kong nung pasko lang yan and panay kain sa labas pano ko iinumin? Sa bwisit ko, I said na bibili nalang ako ng sarili kong ref para hindi na madami masyadong napapansin.

Pati room namin na nakaseparate na napapansin pa. Pati sa kusina sobrang dumi din naman.

Kulang nalang sabihin ko yan sa jowa ko na mas malinis naman yung kwarto namin di hamak kesa sa kwarto nilang makalat dahil lagi akong naglilinis samin, pero kwarto pa ng iba pinapansin ng mommy niya at dahil sa gigil ko na masyado silang maarte at pakialamero para sa taong madumi din naman sa bahay. Nang gigitata nga yung kusina. 

Ultimo sa weight nakikialam. Pati pag bo-body build may comment. Nung hindi ko sinunod dahil ganitong katawan trip ko(hindi naman bulky. Hindi lang lean muscle), sumama loob dahil di daw pinapakinggan. Pati pageexercise, may comment. Pati basketball. Pati paginom ko ng supplements, anong kakainin ko, anong oras ako pupunta sa pupuntahan ko and anong araw, or anong araw lang kami pwede umalis ng jowa ko, may say. Pati sa paghahanap ko sa work noon may comment eh much better naman opportunity kong nahanap. Pati pagtawag ko pag may importanteng gagawin with my GF, may say samantalang siya naman din palaging tawag sa jowa ko pag may need.  
  
Pati sa pagluluto, tipong nagaaral ka nga magluto pakikialaman ka hanggang sa ending siya na nagluto and wala kang natutunan dahil gusto mo matuto hands-on.

I feel so hurt because my friends dont value my time. Nag aya yung friend ko na manood daw kami ng movie. Gusto ko talaga to panoorin kasi ganitong mga genre yung hilig kong palabas. I said ""yes lets watch it premiere week"". This was like a month before showing. However, when she told me na bibili na raw siya ticket(kasi may preselling na) I told her na I wont be able to buy just yet because I have bills and asked her na next time na lang siya bumili. 

The week came na manunood na sana kami. Tinanong ko kung kelan kami manunood that week para makabili na kami ng tickets. Sabi niya game raw siya ng weekend but mauuna na raw siyang manood with her bf. Wala naman akong issue with her and her bf. Akala ko talaga kami yung magkasamang manunood nun kasi she was persistent na manood kami. I got annoyed kasi parang whats the point of watching it together kung alam mo na yung mangyayari. Ayun, watched the movie by myself. 

This is not the first time na nangyari yung ganito. Mag aaya siya tapos di naman pala tuloy. Minsan malalaman ko pa sa iba naming friend na di pala matutuloy. May time pa na naka-prep na ako pero nung nag tanong ako di pala tuloy. 

I know people can cancel plans. Maybe something came up. But I'm just very upset kasi parang paulit ulit na lang na mag pa-plan tapos di naman tuloy. 

I consider myself as very low maintenance friend pero pag may napa-plano na alis I really block that date. Kasi bihira akong lang umalis. May part sakin na feel ko baka OA lang ako magisip but I dont want to invalidate what Im currently feeling. I need you help. What should I do?

18591,1hnaf6b,post,"Minsan talaga, ang buhay ay sobrang nakaka-g**o! 😔","Minsan talaga, o kung hindi man, ay mas madalas na mapapatanong ka na lang talaga kung bakit napakadaya ng buhay.

I have a girlfriend for 9 years. We decided to tie the knot on our 10th anniversary. Everything was properly planned. Everything went well. We were both from a Catholic, traditional and conservative family. She is my first and last girlfriend. Lahat ng gastos sa amin na galing dahil pareho kami gustong i-honor ang aming family and make our parents proud. Okay na okay lahat. We are both working, professional and masasabi kong sapat naman ang kinikita pareho to support a family of 5 (That's what we wanted).

And then, after few months, nag-positive si wifey. After 2 weeks, sumasakit ang tiyan na. Nagpacheck up kami only to find out it was an ECTOPIC pregnancy. Too late na to remove the blood sa fallopian tube niya with only medicines, so she need to undergo surgery and operation. Tinanggalan na siya ng isang fallopian tube since nag-rupture na kasi doon na-stock si Baby instead na sa uterus. We have both to endure the pain of losing our baby. 

We both prayed and tried to have another baby after her doctor said pwede na ulit. Several months, years have passed since then, hirap na kami makabuo. Nagpacheck up ulit siya, only to find out medyo maliit ang fallopian tube ni Misis. Kaya daw siguro nag stock si supposedly baby number 1 namin sa fallopian tube niya kasi hindi na nagkasya habang bumababa sana sa uterus niya. Baka ganun din daw ang kabilang tube niya. 

Ang sakit. Ang hirap. 

We still have a chance. Magastos nga lang. IVF na lang ng pag-asa. 

Bakit ganun? Kami na legal naman lahat. Gustong gusto na magka-anak. Sisiguraduhin namang papalakihin ng mabuti at maayos at punonh puno ng pagmamahal ang mga magiging anak, ay hindi mabigyan ng ANAK. Samantalang merong mga tao na mabilis nga bigyan ng anak ay itinatapon naman. Pinapabayaan lang. Hindi naaalagaan ng maayos.

Ganito ba talaga ang mundo? Sadyang napakalupit minsan. 😔","Minsan talaga, ang buhay ay sobrang nakaka-g**o! 😔 Minsan talaga, o kung hindi man, ay mas madalas na mapapatanong ka na lang talaga kung bakit napakadaya ng buhay.

18593,1hmko7t,post,Nosferatu (2024 [duh]) - Potentially Unpopular??? Opinion?,"Okay, so I’m gonna start off that I hadn’t really absorbed a lot of the core material beforehand. So I was going in mostly blind besides a few cursory google searches. I knew the set, costumes, and cinematography were going to kill just from the trailer alone. When looking into it, I learned how the interpretation of the classic Dracula book was adding in a more “walking dead” element by having Count Olak being rancid and decaying—I thought that was very intriguing! Especially with some adding his features came from German expressionism and I thought that made his character very different from other standard horror movie big bads.

CW: SA and spoilers 

I really, really wanted to like the movie and was excited to see it. But immediately the first scene made me uncomfortable, although it was engaging! It kinda pushed the Alien limit I didn’t know I had, where the theme of assault was used as a way to make the audience tense and uncomfortable (think face huggers/oral 🍇)… but I just didn’t enjoy the way they went about it I suppose. A personal preference/experience?

But throughout the movie it continued, and I suppose as a survivor it was a lot to try and digest. I went in theater because I was excited, but I definitely should’ve waited because without the ability to pause the scenes just kept going even when I couldn’t take a break to process and come back to it. 

The repeated feedings emulated repeat assaults… the nightmares… the seizures that were (at least to me) similar to grinding.. coupled with the groans that were very akin to moaning. I can say with some certainty that some of this HAD to be intentional to be uncomfortable, maybe even made to be a purposeful theme in the film… but as someone who has experienced this… it really was a lot. It unfortunately extremely dampened my ability to enjoy the actual plot and material with the unnecessary nudity and I felt like some of it was particularly male-gaze-y. 

I may delete this later, but I was hoping I could maybe find some solace in others who had the same reaction or at least see where I’m coming from? A lot of it are comparing it to Shakespeare where there are revisions and different versions and are claiming it to be a masterpiece. I see a lot of it there! I just… ugh.

18594,1hm9vup,post,I might be hypersexual because of my brothers.,"I'm a female but I would like to keep my age unknown.

I'm the youngest out of my 3 older brothers and the only girl,  my eldest brother was around 18  and the other two were around 12 and 14-15 at the time I was 6 years old.

I always looked up to my brothers cause I always wanted to be just like them so alot of the times i tried to get their attention by going to their room and talking to them even if they ignored me. Sometimes, I would enter my brothers room and they were always making sexual jokes ig like most teenaged boys but there was a time I walked in and saw my two middle brothers watching porn with their friends and ofc I didn't know what to think of it as a small child so I sat there and watched it with them and I guess no one stopped me or told me to get out. There were ofc many times I've seen then watch or talk about sexual things infront of me like it's nothing and I've even seen the do it..I was around 7 at this time.

One day it was a bit late a night and I was hanging out with my two middle brothers In one of their beds until one of then asked to play a game, me being around 7 years old didn't think much of it and I was excited to play with my big brothers. The game was that one person was blindfolded and had to either feel with their hand or tongue what the bodypart was and had to guess it correctly (we had to touch eachothers body and guess what was what). I ended up playing this game and when it hit my turn I had to feel with my tongue and guess the body part and straight away they made me lick one of their private places which I'm not sure completely but it think it was hard (I might might wrong). When I found out what it was since I was still a child I didn't know it was bad and I thought it was normal so I brushed it off.. we continue playing this game and it kept going into either one of them touching me down there or me needing to feel it.

Til this day I have no idea whether to think of this as SA or not because I didn't do anything to stop it and neither did I show I was uncomfortable in anyway cause I'm wasn't..  now looking back at it I feel really weird and uncomfortable by it and I noticed over the years I clearly had an obsession for sex and had alot of sexual fantasies to the point I hate sex so much but I cant help but want it. Its weird and I'm ashamed for what I did when it as younger but I can't help but blame myself especially since they were also teenagers I thought they would had a sense of what's wrong or right.. I'm not sure how to feel about it and I just feel so guilty.

I'm not sure if I'm hypersexual or not and I'm too ashamed to even find out professionally so I keep it to myself.","I might be hypersexual because of my brothers. I'm a female but I would like to keep my age unknown.

my family is full of narcissists. I’m their fulltime scapegoat, therapist and crutch. I’ve cut them off for obvious reasons. I know everything about all of them. they don’t even know my favorite color or what music I like. They’ve never once hidden the fact I was unwanted and born by mistake. They’ve never said it outright. their actions speak louder than enough. I slept in a closet for years when my mother wanted a room for her things and emptied mine out. 

my first partner was emotionally abusive and manipulative. 6 years. I didn’t realize this for years. I only thought I felt marginally better with them than my family and assumed I was overreacting. I was SA’d and controlled by them for years. living together I was always walking on eggshells. they cheated and kicked me out from “guilt.”

second partner used me just for sex. lasted 6 mths. wasnt subtle about it. always grabbed at me without consent and got pissy when I told them I was tired. they stalk me still and leave me shit in my mailbox. police dont care. 

friends dont know my side with either ex. I kept it private because it’s nobody else’s business. only my therapist knows. and random people reading this I guess. but both exes preached their sides far and wide. everyone thinks I’m crazy and overreacting.

in school I was bullied for being “weird” because I was sad all the time. I had deep dark circles under my eyes in every childhood photo. I don’t remember most of it. I begged my teachers to do something about my family and they told me I could be overly sensitive. my mother told me to kill myself. my best friend died when I was 13 in a car accident but I was supposed to “get over it” and move on and never got to talk about it. 

I almost took my life at 14 and always regret I never did it. 

in every job I either burn out or I underperform and quit. I’ve changed jobs so many times.

my only friend left is a childhood friend I’ve had for a decade. she’s fickle and an alcoholic. sweetest woman I know and the most unreliable.

I’ve cut off so many people. so much shit I haven’t even mentioned because I’m too tired. I don’t remember most of my teen years. 

it’s my last christmas with my family and they don’t know. I’m once again, like every year, wishing I was dead. 

I’ve preserved my peace and haven’t contacted them in a long time. only came out of obligation. no presents. got yelled at and cussed out for zoning out. they think I’m arrogant and that I “feel like I’m above them.” I just want peace. 

I don’t have any ambitions or passions. I don’t care. I don’t trust anyone as far as I can throw them. I don’t want anyone close to me. I don’t want to be vulnerable. I just want to live in peace and quiet. my only goal left is just to be comfortable for once. part of me still thinks I might be overreacting. that I’m just too sensitive and need to pull myself together. I spend days lost in memories of teen and childhood years I’ve forgotten and won’t get back. I might be too sensitive. even if that’s true I still would just rather be alone. I don’t even want to see anyone out of politeness. if I died in an accident it would be a mercy. I genuinely cannot stand looking at other people and want everyone to just go away. I wouldn’t even care if I spent the rest of my life in my room alone. I know this isn’t healthy. I don’t even think I care anymore. I’m chronically ill. I’m going to rheumatologists and doctors all the time and nobody gives a shit. even if I did love someone, loving me is hard work. I can’t even function in my body any better than I do in my mind.

I don’t even want to see anyone out of politeness. if I died in an accident it would be a mercy. I genuinely cannot stand looking at other people and want everyone to just go away. I wouldn’t even care if I spent the rest of my life in my room alone. I know this isn’t healthy. I don’t even think I care anymore. I’m chronically ill. I’m going to rheumatologists and doctors all the time and nobody gives a shit. even if I did love someone, loving me is hard work. I can’t even function in my body any better than I do in my mind. I would be a burden to anyone who wants to care for me. I’d rather be dead. ",4,1,2024-12-24 21:58,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1hlnhsi/ive_given_up_on_people/,Neutral

18600,1hl43wa,post,Matampuhin,"Long post ito.

Hello guys! 32(M) here. May share lang ako na story about sa isang tropa namin na napaka kupal. 
 
First time namin i call out kakupalan nya last Aug (2023) at in fact dun ko lang din napansin na dati pa pala nya kami ginaganon, not as a group but individually.

so eto, isang malaking group kami na nabuo dahil sa inuman. Nag simula sa dalawang tao na laging nag iinom hanggang lumawak tropahan namin umabot ng 20 plus. Lahat kami mag kaka opisina. But now, may nasa BPO pa din, yung iba lumipat ng ibang company at ako and some of us are freelancers na.

So fast forward tayo, August 2023. May ikakasal na tropa. Invited kami, lalo na mga bois sa tropa. Abay lahat, including si kupal. Di ako sure sa age nya pero nsa 36 na ata sya or 38 (M).

2 weeks before ng wedding date nag chat na sa groom sa GC, hinihingi na sukat namin para sa i rerent na attire. Same din kay Bride nag pm na sa gc ng mga girls. Itong si kupal, nag seeseen lang at nag DM ata kay groom ng sukat nya. 

3 days or 2 days before the wedding. 

Nag pm na pala si kupal kay groom na hindi sya makakapunta. At bukod sa kanya, may nag cancel din ata na iba sa circle of friends ng bride. So ito si bride, the usual response nag rant sa FB which is for me normal lang. Nakakainis naman talaga. Summary ng post ""pls lng kung mag kakancel kayo dapt 2 weeks ago pa bago ma finalize lahat ng bagay, nakaka stress. Hindi madali mag re shuffle ng entourage""

For me normal lang at may karapatan si ate bride na magalit at mag post. Then itong si kupal na tropa nag pm sakin with the screenshot nung post. Sabi nya ""Pambihira naman to sila, pinost pa talaga ako. Nag sabi lang ako na hindi makakapunta kasi na decline leave ko sa trabaho. Pag papalit ko pa ba sila sa trabaho ko?"" I replied: Pre matanda ka na, may isip ka na. Nasa tama ginawa ni bride. At walang name drop dun. Hindi lang ikaw nag cancel. Kinasal ka na din. At alam mo ang stress kapag may nag cacancel na guests. Kahit nga hindi sa kasal eh, kahit sa birthday lang.""

He replied: bukod sa hindi ako pinayagan mag leave, nakakatampo lang hindi din kasi ako kasama sa nag plano. Parang naisipan nyo lang ako yayain bigla.

Di na ko nag reply after non. Sinabi ko sa tropahan yung sinabi nya saken. Lahat ng response namin eh napakakupal nga daw. May nag biro pa, ""dapat sya na lang nag organize ng wedding"". May kumantyaw din ""dapat tatlo sila nag plano. (groom,bride, kupal).

At ayun buti naman naka raos yung kasal. Habang tinatype ko pala yung part na nag katampuhan na naalala ko pa, kinupal na din kami dati at kaya feeling nya na naisipan lang sya i invite kasi ang tagal namin bago nakipag usap sa kanya after ng isang instance ng pangungupal nya. So eto yun

mejo maluwag na ang pandemic. 2020 ito or jan 2021. Di ako sure

Nag kita kita kami sa bahay ng isa ng isang tropa. Lahat ininvite. As in all out na invite PM at GC. Yung si tandang kupal nanaman nag reply ""mga tol sorry di ako makakapunta, last lamay ng tropa ko eh maaga libing bukas"" kami naman sbe namin no probs pre, condolence.

Kasarapan ng inuman nag post sya. (Bilang na lang sa daliri ang totoong tropa) So kami wala naman paki dun. I mean, sure kami na hindi kami yun niyaya sya eh at wala naman away prior to our drinking session. Nagulat na lang ako nung mag sesend sana ako ng photo sa gc para sa hindi naka punta (pang asar na photo para sumunod) nakita ko (kupal has left the chat). Pina check ko ngayon sa ibang tropa. Mga ka Offmychest, tangina naka block karamihan samin. Ako lang hindi ata. Sabagay hindi ako naka block nakita ko pa post nya. Eh di nag pm ako sa kanya. Tinanong ko pre anyare? Sabe ""di naman kayo nag yayaya, parsng last minute nyo lang ako naalala yayain"" sagot ko ""pre yung invite ng inom sa GC yon, parang bago ka ng bago. At kung iisipin mo na bkt di ka namin pinilit, nsa burol ka ng patay pre at nag paalam ka""

After non inunfriend na din ako. Binalik lang as a friend nung 6 months bago kasal ng tropa nung time na innanounce yung upcoming wedding.

Ito pa isang pangungupal nya recent lang ito. Nov 26. Nag boracay kami (hindi na sya ininvite kasi ganun nga ginagawa pero friend na ulit sya sa fb ng karamihan)

As usual, nag popost kme ng photos sa soc med. Then may post si kupal ""Tapos na ko sa yabangan sa social media, kayo anjan pa din""

Tinawanan namin nung una kasi inisip namen ah baka may kaaway lang to. Eto nag pm ako, sbe ko pre parsng may kaaway ka ah. Hindi nag reply si kupal. Then mya mya sabi ko sa gc , kausapin na natin ulit si kupal. Patawarin na yung kakupalan mag kita kita tayo pag balik natin Manila.  Lahat nag agree. Nag initiate ng 1 on 1 call yung isang tropa then sinend sa gc. Tapos nag create ng bagong gc at nag VC lahat. Nag sorry sya about dun sa post (eh di umamin na kami nga talaga tinutukoy nya) 

Napatawad, nag set ng inuman Dec 15.

Call time ng inuman 6pm Dec 15. Saktong 6pm nag pm saken si kupal. Hindi ako makakapunta hina highblood ako. Nag send ng picture ng naka BP hahahaha. Di ko na nireplyan gusto ko murahin. Lahat kami fed up na pero iniisip ko patawarin ngayong pasko. Tingin nyo ba kukupalin ulit ako?

Sorry sa long post.","Matampuhin Long post ito.

Everytime we have a fight, lagi niya kaming naccompare

In his most vulnerable state, he still talks about her. Negative or positive about her, but still her.

I asked him tho kung ako lang ba nakakasagabal kasi I will let him go. Sabi niya, hindi coz they talked about na hindi na sila magkakabalikan, in another life nalang daw. 

Idk why i posted this. Masakit lang sa part ko na andami kong issacrifice for this relationship but at the end of the day, siya pa rin yung hahanapin niya pero ako yung pipiliin niya. Iba yung minahal sa pinili niya. I think i deserve to be loved and chosen. In our case, isa lang yung meron ako. Bat ang sakit? :'(

18603,1hjjywo,post,I feel bad about asking for my money back,"""Never lend to family members or consider it a gift"" I know.
I have been sending money to my parents and grandparents monthly for several years now. This is purely a donation from my end, I don't expect anything back from them. I have had the opportunity to find a good job and provide for them too since they've never been in good terms with money.
I live in Europe, they're in SA. 
In 2023 my uncle told me he had an issue with his business and asked me for about 1400 EUR to settle his emergency, this is about what I send in 6 months to my grandparents. He has never requested this before and I wanted to help, I had some money from my savings, so I sent him that money. He told me that he would pay me back soon, I said 'no worries take your time when you're able to send the amount you can send, don't worry'
So he started paying me back around January 2024, and then he stopped. He still owes me around 1000 EUR. The thing is, he's had an accident around may and had a bad year financially. He has recovered his health but it pains me to know that he's not doing well. So I was like, let's forget that money and move on.
The thing is, this year I'm not making as much as the years before, I'm burned out and close to lose my job. So I know I might need this money back at some point. 
So I told him today, if he could pay me back somewhere next year, it's not urgent. He said he would. And I felt so bad for asking my money back but psychologically I needed to ask him so I could stop thinking about this :(

TLDR: I feel bad for asking for money back from a struggling family member ","I feel bad about asking for my money back ""Never lend to family members or consider it a gift"" I know.

18608,1hidauz,post,Should i go? ,"Its long but i really need help, i promise its worth it. 

Okay so, i first met this guy back on feb 2024. We started dating in march. (Too soon, my mistake). And we kept on dating until may, when he broke up with me (one day after my bday lol). I still loved him so much that i fucking begged him to stay. He told me that he still loved me too and that we could still talking and treating each others as a couple but not being one. I, unfornunatly, accpeted it and we continued talking...i was/i am madly in love with him and he knew that, but he does/do this weird thing were he talks me about how much he misses his exes (he was doing this when he were in a relationship too) and he compared me A LOT with all of his exes (he still do), but i loved him so much i didnt care. Even when we broke up he would send me messages talking me about his romantic life, other people better than me and his exes knowing that he was harming me...he would do this to ""make me jealous"" because he liked that ""controling"" side of me...(ironic btw because the first time we broke up he complained about how i was so controling and jealous like i wasnt acting that whole thing up because i didnt really cared about his friends.) i let that pass. 

Suddenly, he meets this girl and stops talking to me. I kept going  with my life even tho it hurted me since we were still acting like we were in a relationship and he just changed me for a girl that he first saw 3 days ago????...2 weeks pass and we were in 0 contact since that girl arrived. He sends me a message out of nowhere saying that this girl just left. I, obviously start to take care of him because i loved him sm and i knew that feeling of loving someone so deeply that suddenly leaves (it happend to me w/him) and i know that when that happends all you want to do is talk about that person. So i decided to let him talk to me about this girl...He starts talking about how she was the only one that had his heart and that he was deeply in love with her and bla bla bla...i was crying while i read those messages, i still really loved him but i let my emotions appart and continue listtening  because i wanted him to feel better and listened, omething i couldnt do when i broke up with him so i knew what that felt like and i didnt want him to expirience that, 

  
All of this happend from june to september. He met the girl, he fell in love after 3 days and two weeks later she was gone and i was listening to the boy i was in love with talking about another girl. We started to get along really well as friends and i was really happy, i had lost my feelings towards him or so i thought...In september, he starts saying that he is in love with me...i (because im dumb) tell him that i am still in love with him. He says that he doesnt want a relationship with me but he just loves to have my attention and him being my center...i told him i could do that for him (big mistake, girl, love yourself) so i acted like his girlfriend and giving him all my love while he told me about other girls...

  
In november we had a big fight because i was tired of 9 months of giving him everything and he just loving me one day and the other no. He told me i was lying and i was blaming him. At the end of november we started talking again and he told me he really missed me and that he was really in love with me and he was serious this time...i fucking belived him. We started treating eachothers as a couple even tho we werent. until one day he asked me to be his girlfriend. i accept, happily. The next morning i wake up with a text saying that (again) he loved having my attention and me being from him because he hate to see me with other people but he didnt want him to be mine. He said that he was free and loved being single but still i was his. (ermm...dude...)

So, my actual situation... i think he has desorganized attachment and that is why he loves me one day and the other treats me like shit and that is why i think i will be a bad person if i leave...i just cant hold it anymore, its draining me and my mental health is worse than ever.

18610,1hhy2tj,post,I gave my government teacher a personal letter,"Godddd I feel so stupid it’s so corny
It’s not a love letter dw.
It’s just that he’s very into women’s rights and very protective and kind, even though he’s also a guy who could go into a screaming tirade if you speak one too many times and has a short temper.
But I got attached, even though sometimes I hated him, and so I wrote him a letter.
A letter about how nice he was and how I always felt comforted around him because he was someone I felt I could trust. Then I opened up about what happened to me (sa basically idfk)
I did this during our final exam when I had time. And then I folded it up and told him at the end to read it when I’m out of the room or when he’s going home.

I assumed he didn’t read it yet because he greeted me casually a few minutes later when me and a friend were looking for another friend before we went home.. but also I think I messed up.
I got too personal again. This was my need t be heard. My cry for help. My outlet or need for validation again. And I dragged a random man into it.
It was a good feeling at the time, but now I’m too embarrassed. I just don’t want to suffer anymore. 
So this really isn’t about the letter, it’s about me finally opening up and regretting it.
But I’ve already accepted that  I’ll never get help. ","I gave my government teacher a personal letter Godddd I feel so stupid it’s so corny

18611,1hhnzoh,post,Why do people listen when adults talk shit/gossip/vent about their kids?,"I’m no contact from my mother and I often think about all of the times when she did me wrong and then brought a bunch of adults who she lied to before hand. 

Then I would be confused as to why they were making angry faces at me and ignoring me when I spoke 

I pieced it together when my 50yr old mom brought a 40yr old over after I cursed at her for the first time (she’d been calling me slurs and refused to have an adult conversation about it) 

Tmi but she basically tried sleeping with him in front of me and when I confronted them, she lied pathologically of course. He apologized to me and left. She blamed me. 

He obviously realized that she does disgusting shit like that then lies on me when I speak up 

I went through so much with her. I gave her 600$ when a 100$ car part that was bound to fall off (it was a guard for a part of the car that’s frequently hit. Expensive car so I gave her all I had) 

Told everyone, including our family mechanic, that I hit her car but not that I gave her money for it

Lied to me when I bought my first car and told me I can’t change my mind about which car I want before I paid (made me a gullible adult. I’m so angry at her parenting for it. And I was stuck with a cheap car that constantly broke down)

The family mechanic sympathized with her because she paid for my repairs (she had a good job, didn’t want me working to the point of going to my job and telling my boss to fire me at my first) 

And when I found out that she and my brother who’d been SA me out a tracker on my car (they were overly concerned with me dating, having sex, and masturbating as an adult) I had to figure out how with my dv counselor. I was correct and the family mechanic ignored me reaching out for help 

I just wonder why

When people are talking shit about the kids that they raised theirselves

Why are people okay with adults wanting their kids to be seen as anything other than raised well…

My mom let my dad kidnap us as kids and as adults, she laid around high and drunk having us do her errands 

And people swear to god she has nothing to do with the complaints she makes about us. Even up to the moment I left her! After she tried kicking me out! She called the same people who she bragged that she was kicking me out to when I left in hopes that I’d tell them where I was and they’d tell her and they helped! It makes NO sense 

And I know I’m describing narcissistic abuse and being in the twighlight zone and enablers/flying monkeys. All that shit 

I just want to hear from an adult who listens to other adults trash their kids… why didn’t you think anything of it

18613,1hh9eak,post,I'm smitten like an anime school girl ,"While my peers spent their highschool years dating people and have tons of silly crushes, I spent my time in a long term relationship with a man who was too old old for me. I was trying so hard to make it work that I ignored any feelings I may have had for other people. Last year the relationship ended and a few months later I kinda tried to date a new guy because  everyone was telling me the best way to heal a broken heart is to find someone new (NOT TRUE!). However, that went horribly as he decided to SA me and left me quite traumatized. Once again I rejected all possible feelings that I may feel for others in fear that something horrible may happen.

Recently, I've developed a huge crush on a guy I work with. He's very beautiful and very sweet. Usually I hate it when people say my name for some reason but when he says my name my heart flutters. He's turned my heart of stone to clay and I feel naively ridiculous. Whenever he talks to me, my face turns red. The other day I dropped something and he picked it up for me and handed it to me. When I took it from him, my finger slightly brushed against his and my heart started beating so hard I could hear it in my ears. My usually boring work days go by super fast as of late because I'm just so happy and infatuated. When I go home, as I walk to my car, I giggle to myself because I'm smitten like some kind of school girl despite being 22 years old.

I'm crushing so hard and it feels ridiculous. In some ways I'm acting the way I did when I was a 15 year old girl, all smitten for a boy in class, making sure my hair was nice and to wear my best cheapy perfume. He appears in my dreams, I listen to cheesy love songs from the 80's and think of him, I even notice that some of my drawings of men look a bit like him despite me not intentionally doing that. I think since I never really had the chance to  have crushes on people and be all smitten and dorky when I was growing up, these feelings are hitting me way harder than it would other women my age. I'm mature in many other ways, but in the matter of infatuation and love I am no better than a highschooler.

In some ways, I'm also very nervous to have these feelings, like something bad will happen to me for feeling this way. I've been very unlucky when it comes to men, to some degree I just inherently fear them. I feel weak that a man has caused the walls I put up to falter ever so slightly. He doesn't know how I feel, but if he did he would have just a little bit of power over me. I pride myself on being a strong woman, I always tell my friends that I no longer concern myself with men. 
If any of y'all have ever watched the He-Man and She-Ra Christmas special, I feel like Skeletor when he holds that alien puppy and says like ""I am not nice!"" in attempts to keep up his villainous image","I'm smitten like an anime school girl  While my peers spent their highschool years dating people and have tons of silly crushes, I spent my time in a long term relationship with a man who was too old old for me.

18617,1hflyfp,post,I feel so guilty over my sisters hell of a life,"

My (27f) older sister (35f) has had a rough go for what seems like her entire life. As a child she was troubled, had certain emotional issues and attention issues and my parents really didn’t help her at all. They had her when they were young and just frankly didn’t know how to be parents. I’m quite a bit younger so by the time I came along they were better. Around the time I was in 7th grade something horrible happened to my sister. We were all having a party actually for my sisters 20th birthday and my dad drunkenly SA’ed her that night. After that her life truly took a turn for the worse. She tried cutting off my parents I was stuck with them being that I was still in middle school but after that happened they weren’t around much anyway always leaving on the weekends etc so I didn’t have to be around them too much. My sister was newly married and got pregnant quickly by her husband only for an even quicker divorce to happen 6 months after my nephews birth due to her husband cheating and just being generally shitty. There’s divorce number 1. 

After that she had to move back in with us so her and my nephew lived with us all the way up until I graduated high school. During that time my sister kinda went off the rails, partying a lot, we actually regularly had parties at our house too when my nephew was with his dad and like I said my parents were gone all the time which was probably for the best. I ended up caring for my nephew a lot on the weekends she did have him because she typically partied even on the weekends he was with us but I didn’t. When I graduated I went to college a few hours away and honestly came home as little as possible. She started working for my parents and has ever since. She met another guy that she eventually married as well. They were together 6 years total and things started off okay but as the years went on they became extremely unhappy. Constant fighting, drunkenness, him having and OF addiction, violence. She finally had enough and divorced him and it was an extremely rocky divorce that took two years to finalize due to husband refusing to sign things, he would constantly stalk her, harass her, etc. Despite that she was actually happy during this time being single. Improving her relationship with my nephew, making friends, having fun just generally happier than I’d seen her in a long time. But always desperate to find someone to be with romantically. She ends up meeting this guy that actually worked for our family business years prior so they kinda knew each other but they started dating right before I got married in 2023. They moved quickly and got engaged 6 months after meeting. I kinda got a bad vibe from him from the start but she seemed happy. Until she wasn’t. Things quickly became toxic just like her past two marriages. He would get belligerently drunk and jealous, constantly go through her phone, accuse her of looking at other guys while out, etc and then they’d get home and he would just verbally abuse her for hours. Calling horrible names, calling her fat, ugly, telling her he has other girls lines up, attacking her inability to have more children (they were actually in process of doing ivf). These fights happened basically every few days due to his drinking. We all tried convincing her to take a step back but nonetheless she married him anyway summer 2024. Marriage 3. The fighting continued and seemed to escalate. Fast forward to this past weekend, my husband and I and our 6 month old met my sister her husband and my nephew out for lunch and to go ice skating. They invited us over for a couple drinks afterwords. Things seemed to be going good and everyone in good spirits but I had already told my husband not to over do it with the drinks because we don’t want to influence her husband to get wasted and start shit with her that night. We stayed a while had fun but then left and went on about our night. Well I got the call at midnight from my mom that my sisters husband had been arrested for attacking and choking my sister. My nephew saw the whole thing and he is the one who called the police and his dad who came to get him. Sisters husband is still in jail and she’s just beside herself. The thing is she is mostly upset that he’s arrested because it means she pretty much has to end things. I think if this would’ve happened and the cops wouldn’t have gotten involved she’d have just accepted it and moved on but now the cops and cps are involved since it happened in front of my nephew. 

I’m so sorry this is so long but I’m just like fuck man. How can someone possibly have this bad of luck and so many horrible things happen to her. She’s definitely made some of her own decisions that have led her to this place as well, but it seems her life has been doomed since she was a child. And then what my dad did to her really just fucking ruined her. And my life hasn’t been perfect, I’ve had my own issues with substances in the past and shitty men, but like I went to college I now have a great husband a perfect baby, I’ve always just been more resilient than her even through hardships and it seems like she just can’t catch a break. I just can’t imagine the feeling of such extreme failure and doom of being alone and just harmed by so many people. 

I’ve struggled so much with hating my parents for what they’ve done to her but also accepting them for the other parts of them. Sometimes I want to just run away and remove myself from my family entirely. I just feel such extreme pain for her. Despite hardships I’ve been through things seem to always end up eventually working out for me and for her it’s just the opposite. It’s like she can’t catch a break and her life is just full of sadness and pain and violence and it just hurts so bad and I feel such immense guilt. Especially when it comes to my parents. How could they do that to her and even in general they are so much nicer to me than her and I think it’s because I’ve always been more distant with them like I’m close with them but I keep them more at arms reach and don’t involve them in my personal business, they weren’t around much through my teen and young adult years meanwhile she constantly has to go to them for help out of her shitty relationships. And I just can’t imagine being so dependent on people that hurt me the way they have to her. It’s just so much. I don’t know.

18620,1heml6d,post,My dog died today. I have a major exam tomorrow.,"I just came from a 3 days duty. Nakatulog agad ako pag-uwi because of exhaustion. Yesterday, before I go to my duty, I already saw papa and mama talking through video call. Nakita ko rin na nakahiga na ‘yung baby (dog) ko. I already had a clue. But knowing I have a lot on my plate right now and I am already numb from everything that is happening, I brush it away and told myself na I’ll try to go. I’ll think of it when I have an extra time.

So I continued my day even though I was half preoccupied knowing that my dog is sick and we know na malapit na siya kunin. Alam niyo ‘yung feeling na gusto mo mag breakdown but you cannot physically? Ready ka na for whatever is happening but you cannot just accept the idea na mawawalan ka na naman ng isang baby.

To make the story short, umuwi si papa sa province to check sa dog namin and to accompany mama rin. When I get home, nakatulog ako sa pagod and sa pag iisip. 

When I woke up today, I planned on reviewing the whole day since I have two major exams tomorrow. In the middle of it, I received a message from mom asking how old our dog is… I already have a hunch na why she is asking. Before I even replied, she told me na wala na ‘yung baby ko. I don’t know how I will handle the news. I was too empty. I cannot reply kina mama because I am reviewing and grieving inside. From too much emotion, hindi ko na alam how can I continue that’s why I’m here venting. I am also blaming myself for being too busy na I have no time to spare just to visit my babies. My schedule won’t allow me. I am a college student. Maybe, if only I go there together with papa, I would have more time with them. Maybe we can bring him to the vet even tho wala na talagang chance.","My dog died today. I have a major exam tomorrow. I just came from a 3 days duty.

18623,1hd5tpo,post,My bf got conscripted and it broke me ,"I (28m) recently got into a long-distance relationship with someone (24M) in another country. I'm not naming names (though you can probably figure it out) but his country is involved in a major war. He tried everything to get out of conscription. No doctor would declare him medically unfit. I would've helped him leave the country but it was already too late by the time we met. He ended up being called up about a week ago. Since the moment we said goodbye I've just been absolutely broken. There's no other word for it.  

He told me he's not actually going to be mobilized. That the only thing that'll happen is we'll be unable to communicate for a few months to a year. But who knows what the situation will look like tomorrow? I just don't know, and it's driving me insane. And it's bad enough even if he never sees combat. His country isn't exactly nice to LGBT people and its army especially has a bit of a track record. I keep having nightmares about him being SA'd, or dying alone and terrified in some horrific way. I feel so helpless and it's killing me. Shortly before it happened I was going through some stuff of my own and started feeling annoyed with him for being too clingy. But now I'd amputate my arms and legs to have him be clingy with me again. I feel like I wasted the little time we had with my selfishness and I'm so angry at myself. He's such a kind, gentle, intellectual person, and he doesn't deserve any of this. I wish it could've been me instead of him, I deserve it way more than he does. 

I hate that we never got to do any of the things that people in normal relationships take for granted. We never got to hug. We never got to go for a walk together. We never got to cuddle on the couch watching a movie together. It feels wrong to mention it, but we never got to have sex. I never even said ""I love you"" to him because I'm a coward, and I want to beat the shit out of myself for it. At this point I don't even care if he forgets me or finds someone else during his time away. In fact on some level I would welcome it because that means he won't be suffering so much. I just want an assurance that he will be OK, and I can't even have that. 

I've heard every kind of disgusting comment since I first made the mistake of sharing this. I've been laughed at, told that the world would be better off if he died, told that he will be turned into hamburger meat or passed around the barracks like a party favor. So if you're planning to tell me these things, or to make this your soapbox about politics and morality, I'm not going to waste my time gracing you with a response. I don't know why I'm expecting Reddit to be any better but the truth is I don't really have anywhere else left, and I just need someone to tell me everything is going to be OK.

18624,1hd1jod,post,fresh grad na nagmadali mag work,"I graduated last June, and after taking a month of rest, well, not a full rest, since I had to finish the year-end report for my school leadership organization, complete my clearance, and process necessary documents for work, I decided it was time to apply for a job before diving into my intensive board exam review.  

A friend referred me to the company where she recently started working. I went for the interview and was hired on the spot. I was honestly shocked because, for me, parang ang bilis ng pangyayare, One moment I was binge-watching K-dramas every night, and the next, I was hired—without even knowing the full job description! I applied as an office admin btw and relocated immediately from the province to the city, which is 6-8 hours away from home.  

At first, I was thankful to have a job. But then came my first day at work, HAHA! There was no proper training. All I could do was observe the staff and learn a specific task they taught me. Okay naman siya, and I’ve been doing it for months now. However, I started questioning the company’s dynamics, especially how my boss assigns tasks at midnight—even after duty hours—and expects me to finish them within two hours because, as they say, nababagot siya mag-antay. I even handled old applicants na hindi ko alam ang status. jusq. Walang proper distribution of task, kung ano maisip nya na ipagawa sa’kin aside from my specific role, ipapagawa nya. Hindi ko rin alam anong purpose nung mga layout na nagawa ko. Grabe, from office admin, to IT, to lay-out artist to Cheif -of -staff to marketing… ano next? I am so confuse kung ano talaga role ko.  Ganto ba yung peter principle? Haha! 

At first, I tolerated it because I thought, baka ganito talaga sa private companies, but deep down, I knew it wasn’t right. I felt exhausted. Thankfully, I have my partner, who’s been my source of rest and comfort. But I’ve grown so disappointed with how we’re being managed. For instance, our salaries often get delayed because hindi pa bumabayad yung mga old applicants or wala masyadong applicants. Worse, when there are no applicants, lahat ng sisi sa amin ( ‘di naman kami marketing).

My salary is ₱15,000, with payouts every 15th and 30th. Sometimes, I don’t even get the full amount kasi minsan 10days lang yung and then per day ata ang counting. Pati kung pano yung pag compute ng sweldo ‘di namin alam. Kaloka! Yung salary ko tinitipid ko nalang, minsan na giguilty pako bumili ng pagkain na masarap kasi ayoko gumasto kasi tama lang talaga sya sa allowance till next payout. Initially, I thought I could save, but living in the city is expensive, especially with rent and my review center fees.  

It’s a start-up company, but my boss runs it as if it’s been established for over a decade. Sure, the head office is more experienced, but this branch only started last year—and even had to change its name due to bad records. I was the one who set up everything: dealing with lending partners, resolving issues, and addressing concerns. Sinasabi ko naman sa boss ko, but their reply is always along the lines of, “hanapan rin nila yan ng paraan; we cannot always feed them.” Andali sabihin sakanya kasi she thought, everyone has the same privilege as her.  

What frustrates me more is that I’ve never received any incentives for all my efforts. Meron, 500, pang llao llao nalang pag sobrang sakit na sa ulo nung araw araw na pag deal sa mga issues. When the company started gaining more clients and earning percentages from lending deals, my coworkers (including my friend) were more excited about the incentives than I was.  Pakihanap naman sila nung panahon na sobrang stress ako makipag-usap sa lending at nung andaming demands galing sa mga applicants. I even worked while traveling, composing partnership letters during marketing trips. 

At this point, I’m just waiting for my contract to end. Keeping it all, just to survive.

Takeaways from My Experience  
To anyone reading this, here are a few lessons I’ve learned:  
1. Enjoy your rest. It’s essential to recharge before taking on new responsibilities.  
2. Choose the right company. Look for one that offers a healthy working environment.  
3. Check the job description. Stick to the tasks outlined in your role.  
4. Research the company. Know its background and reputation.  
5. Make sure your efforts are valued and compensated.

I know it’s hard to find the perfect company, but at least aim for one that fits your needs and values your contributions.","fresh grad na nagmadali mag work I graduated last June, and after taking a month of rest, well, not a full rest, since I had to finish the year-end report for my school leadership organization, complete my clearance, and process necessary documents for work, I decided it was time to apply for a job before diving into my intensive board exam review.

18625,1hbprri,post,Today was a very tiring day.,"This is quite a random recollection of events but I just need to talk to someone, but I don't really have many friends.

So I started off today by my ears being in pain since I accidently slept on right ear. I had just gotten my helix and my earlobe pierced 4 days ago meaning I'm not supposed to sleep on it in case they get infected. I still don't know if they are infected or not, but it was irritating my ear the whole day since the metal got smooshed into my ear. I was also late for school and I ran as quickly as I coul only to realise I came an hour early. (Read my analog watch incorrectly.)

We had a school excursion today so I asked my mum for money. She gave me 9 dollars in coins (Read 10 cents). So I had to carry around 90 coins asking if anyone wanted change for 9 dollars. Not really tough just funny. Except I have an incredibly large fear of talking to new people that I'm not already aquainted with. 

I got ten dollars - which might seem good - but I scammed a poor girl out of 1 dollar. I tried to give her two 50 cent coins, but she wouldn't take them. That interaction has been on my mind all day.

Because of the excursion all of us had to walk 40 minutes through a bunch of different areas, most of which were wet, muddy and grassy. My socks were drenched and I felt horrible/sick because of the cold. I had enough sense to bring an umbrella but it didn't rain so it was unfortunetly stolen by a delinquent. (My bestfriend) This delinquent then proceeded to violently assualt me with a weapon. (Bonked my head multiple times with the umbrella.)

The excursion was pretty boring, to the point where I actually fell asleep where I was sitting.

The walk back was worse because it was incredibly sunny and I could feel the UV rays giving me skin cancer as I walked begrudgingly through the muddy trail, wet dirt seeping into my socks. 

Afterwards, my friend got me to lie to my mum to go christmas shopping with him, which was even worse because I forgot my phone at home. (I'm not to mad about this part, I was fairly chill with it). At the shops I bought some snacks which totaled to about $5 and I wanted to buy my friend food but he wanted to pay for himself. I got the snacks and saw him walk out, so I instinctively started following him so that he wouldn't pay for the food. I then got yelled at (rightfully so) by the shopkeeper for ""shoplifting"". 

I felt so goddamn guilty and just generally sad because the shopkeeper probably thought I was some teenage punk who wanted to steal. (This was not my intention) No matter how much I apologised, I still felt incredibly guilty. (dw I paid) To make matters even worse, my friend paid for the food while I was apologising to the shopkeeper.

 My bus was also really late, so I came home an hour and a half after school ended.

Now all of these are just some little bad things that happened to me. Would I say my day was horrible? No of course not. Was my luck a bit worse than usual. Yes absolutely. But the next part is the reason why I hated my day so much.

  
**Trigger Warning: SA.**

This was really scary. A guy in our grade was also at the shopping centre, and I didn't think much of him until my friend whispered to me that he s\*xually assualted a 7th grader. He forced himself onto the poor kid and kissed the junior without permission. Just overall really disgusting. He also apparently did other things but I don't know if it's true, or just rumours from what he did. Generally just a bad guy, should be avoided at all costs. I'm pretty sure he was reported to the school. 

  
Anyway this guy sits right next to me at the bus station and sits just behind me on the bus. Obviously I am terrified, because this guy is a good head taller than me and I don't know how to defend myself. I grab my umbrella as close to me as possible and just pray for the best. Luckily he didn't do anything, but that was probably the scariest 25 minutes of my life. Just me stuck with a dude I know for a fact is dangerous on an empty bus.","Today was a very tiring day.

18626,1i4chae,post,My rapist is lying about me years later,"Hi, I'm M(26), and this starts 8 years ago about 3 months after my 18th birthday. I went out to this local club that played alternative music, had cheap drinks, and had some good local bands. My second time there I meet my ex, then F(22), she was a loud big titty goth girl and my dumbass 18 year old was naive and despite warnings from friends I took a pass. We ended up back at her friends place on the couch, that probably should have been the first red flag.

The next day we went to the city, before I went home, we got lunch, I paid and bought her smokes, being promised to be paid back. This was the first month of the relationship. In this time she told me about how her exes had beat and raped her, told me explicit details. One of her exes reached out to me telling me everything was lies, even had his girlfriend say the same. I ignored them. 

Second month I find out she ""used"" to smoke meth, she promised me she quit and wouldn't go back. I trust her, a week later she asks me to buy her smokes, I say no, she slaps me, tells me I'm pathetic and trying to control her. One night I won't go out drinking with her, she threatens to go back to her ex, I go out, she keeps handing me shots, I don't remember getting home, I remember her on top of me and I freeze. I say nothing, I let her finish and roll over. That happened 3 other times over the next 2 months. 

One night I tell her I'm not interested, she keeps grabbing at me, pulling down my pants, and when I push her off me, she began to choke me. My vision began going black, I gave in and took it. All this time whenever I tried to leave she threatened suicide.

When I finally left, she took all the abuse she did to me, turned it into her story, told everyone I abused her. I tried to cut her out and move on, got therapy after dealing with panic attacks and realising I was on a misogynist pipeline based on revenge because after leaving her, I was so terrified of every woman being like that I listened to the worst men. My therapist helped me in so many ways, I healed, I found love and am engaged.

2 days ago a friend from back then sent me my exes IG story, claiming I am currently sending her nudes to people. She has continued to spin her abuse as her survival story, I was too scared to go to the police now and fear it's too late. I am tired of this, I just want her to leave me alone. She beat me, raped me, she made me hate myself, she makes me feel weak to this day. I hate that she has this power over me, I just don't know how much more I can take at this point.

EDIT: I left after finding out she had been on meth and cheating on me with her dealer the entire time. I found out because she sent him and 2 others to jump me outside the club. I managed to get lucky and not get the shit kicked out of me immediately and other people from the club got in between and I left.

I was physically abused as a toddler and verbally abused from then on out. Was punished for trivial things and humiliated in front of friends by mom. I still hate her for it to this day. Persistent depressive disorder and seasonal depression set in when I was 13 and I still struggle with it. I'm getting a psychiatric re-evaluation in the next few days because I tried to live life without anti-depressants for a few months, but it's looking like I'll have to take them for the rest of my life.

I got caught smoking weed back in college when it was still illegal and was facing jail time. Made plans to kill myself to avoid inevitable prison rape, wrote a suicide note and ended up in the psych ward of the nearest hospital. I wish I could go back to the ward. Life was boring there but it was simple and uncomplicated. There was nothing to worry about and you had regular interaction with a colorful community. I wish I could go back and live the rest of my life there.

I got Lyme's disease a year after leaving the psych ward. My doctors never caught it and I developed fibromyalgia, which gives you uncurable chronic pain all over your body along with headaches, fatigue and disturbed sleep. My shitty sleeping makes my depression worse and my mood swings wildly on the drop of a hat. I used to be into body building, playing piano and playing video games, but the chronic pain makes it harder and harder every year to do any of that. The things that made life enjoyable and gave me purpose are giving way to the unending aches and soreness.

I was going to write another paragraph about how I've been single for 8 years and how friends are making less and less time for me as they settle down with their partners, but I feel like you get the picture. My life has been getting worse year after year for 10 years now, and I'm probably going to kill myself if things don't turn around by the time I'm 40. I refrained from offing myself back in college and I'm still waiting for something to make my restraint worth it.

18629,1i2l36l,post,"32M, childhood sexual abuse, or bullying or my own fault, regardless I was traumatized. ","I have been struggling with shame, guilt, low self esteem and negative self talk for a long time. 

I have been a startup founder right after college and have failed and started up multiple times. My present one is a 5 year old start up. Due to work I have not been able to take a long break needed to heal my past but I can no longer put aside facing my past.
People pleasing and negative self talk drains all my energy and I am not able to do anything. 

My father was an alcoholic and my mother suffered from anxiety. I was raised at my aunt's place, till I was in second grade and was sent to a boarding after that. I was very sensitive and sweet kid. The kids of the boarding were not all like that. 

Since I was athletic and studious I was not subjected to bullying by everyone yet I was constantly picked up on by couple of guys, for one year I served as their servant before I beat all three of them together. I was very naive and dumb in street sense, a classic geek. (I once prayed for my bully for he was extremely sick)

Many traumatic events happened during my time in the boarding but the worst was in the fourth standard. I was moved in a room with my best friend and another guy, who was affable. 

My best friend was the most popular guy and we got along well till we got into 4th and then I learnt that he knew a lot about sex, something that I always stayed away from talking about. 

But now everyone was talking about it so I too wanted to be a part of it. One day we decided to go for sexual exploration. Two guys will cuddle and one will keep a watch. 

We started doing that. I was a people pleaser then as well. As we were doing it my friend said it would be nice if we can get naked, to show him that I can be trusted I took off my pants and he spat on me before making fun of me. I literally served my ass to him to show he is safe. (This is the part that I always blame myself for, and times I feel I was naive, still I feel I deserved what I got post this)

Next day he told this to everyone and now everyone made fun of me. Kids would mess with me just to earn cool points. New ways would be invented and new stories were circulated. I had become the local wh*r*. 

Everyone wanted to fight me and even after getting beaten up they would come back again next day, whereas I would feel I survived another day. I was already an anxious kid and Soon I started feeling extremely weak, I could not talk to anyone and do anything. 

Once that happened things worsened. I would be ganged up on by all the kids who would grope me and would enact rape scenes from the movies. I was once chased by two bulky guys in a room who were trying to tear my clothes, I had lost all the will to fight back but just wanted to defend myself (I was wish I had anger in me instead of self blame)

Another time I was on the bathroom floor surrounded by all the guys making sexual gesture with their genitals. Worst is that by now I was laughing hysterically as they kicked me. 

I was numbed out and to this day I believe it was my fault. I have wondered why did it happen to me that I was bullied in my second grade (I understand why in 4th grade) but other kids were not. I feel there was something wrong with me. 

I don't have any memories of my family life before I was 8 years old. Post that I got into boarding. I believe I was responsible for everything that happened with me. 

I believe that we keep repeating our patterns till we fully understand them, to some degrees I do but still I keep creating situations where I am under a lot of stress. 

I have never been a ""sharing my problems type"" feeling as if others should not be burdened by my problems. But they have now reached to a state where my stress is visible to everyone that loves me and it has started to hinder my relationships a lot. Everyone is worried because I am the best listener as per everyone in the groups that I am ever part of, letting people talk for hours without getting tired. At my work I am everyone's unofficial therapist. They want to help me but don't know how and I can't share what I need help with on everyday basis for I feel I pay price of my own acts and my problems are my creation. 

I intend to share them on this platform so that, if possible I can talk about it to others. ","32M, childhood sexual abuse, or bullying or my own fault, regardless I was traumatized.  I have been struggling with shame, guilt, low self esteem and negative self talk for a long time.

18630,1i2enud,post,"i want love, but i’m terrified of it and exhausted. ","my first relationship was a highschool boy, he constantly tried pressuring me into sex and adding another dude to the relationship. i constantly denied and said i wasn’t into that but he had me so convinced he loved me. he didn’t work he just gamed 24/7 and i picked up two jobs at the time to pay for his car/ insurance/ rent at his parents house. he used me then cheated with a dude and it didn’t really hurt,  i think i checked out a year in honestly, lasted three years. 
my second wasn’t really a relationship, i was desperate to travel and find better work so i moved accross the country by myself and became roomates with a old family friend (4 years older than me) well it was great for about three months until one night he through a fleshlight at me and said “you can’t expect to live with a man and not put out” my fault really he was probably right and i missed that lesson in how to fucking coexist with humans. he raped me and i became a mother from that one time on october 28th 2021. 
we’ll flash forward obviously i left but not after being tapped inside his house for 9 months because he confiscated my phone and any communication to the outside world, my dad found me and got me and my son out after a lot of physical abuse. 
a guy came around 8 months after u escaped and i knew i wasn’t ready but he saw my hesitation as a competition, was very persistent and i eventually gave in once i saw he was a single dad with a sweet daughter a few years older than my son. i fell in love with her and how she and my son would play but the man, i had such a bad gut feeling but thought it was just because of the rape i was scared. so i stayed 3months with him and he became extremely abusive/ controlling/ violent and i think he actually had bipolar or was just a straight psycho. 
so i left and here i am happily single but still find myself daydreaming. 

late at night when the whole world is closing in and i sit and look at my very pathetic life i just wish i could’ve found real love. i wish i had someone that held me when i found out i had congenital heart failure 6 months ago. i wish someone was there at all my surgeries with teddybears and snacks, i wish someone was holding my hand while i wait to see if a can find a good doctor to fix my heart and i’m growing weaker by the day. i wish i had someone who would get those cute pokémon themed valentine gifts, random flowers, bake brownies with me in the kitchen, spontaneous dates, simple living just existing happily with each other like best friends, someone to play all these video games with, someone who sees me as more than sick, more than a rape victim and single mom, more than the things that happened to me. i’m tired of being a fucking charity case i just want to live while i can. i wanna be someone’s backpack and help fix or tune their sport bike (i love mechanic work it’s always been my dream career), or someone to get street tacos at 2 am with, go to car meets, play on playgrounds at parks, explore the world and enjoy the things the world has to offer.
but i’m scared because i am what happened to me, i have a child, i’m extremely ill and no one wants to put up with that it’d be selfish to expect them to.

18631,1i24d87,post,A lifetime of abuse is starting to choke me as an adult/Mommy Issues,"This is way too personal to not use a burner. I think I might have C-PTSD. It's honestly just a lot of trauma dumping and this isn't even all of it, I recently tried therapy and just did not click with my therapist. 

I was adopted when I was young, I was an accident youngest born to a drug addicted mother who used while pregnant with me. I have lifelong neurological issues which interfere with my daily life due to that drug use, but I hide it well. I was told that my mother used to be beaten a lot when she was pregnant with me, for some reason this always bothered me. I never got the chance to meet her, and my father died shortly before she did. I just know that she very much did not want anything to do with me, and that I was a mistake. 

I still have really dark memories about foster kids that I don't remember if they are real memories or not. I still remember a kid being molested by his brother, in front of me. I have many memories of being beaten. The images from being in a fetal position on the ground while I get beaten by multiple people comes to mind a lot when I don't want it to.

I grew up around a lot of death, and a lot of my time in my formative years was spent in hospices and hospitals waiting for someone to die. My biological siblings died, my adoptive family were all elderly and they died too. I love my adoptive parents but I never had a super touchy feely relationship with them, and I bore the brunt of their anger and frustration often due to the stress. I also have memories of a mentally ill family friend who would be pretty psychologically abusive to me, and I remember when I was about 12 I asked why she would do what she does and she told me about being raped by her brother and beaten by her father as well as some downright weird physical abuse from her mother. It's seared into my memory where she told me about being locked into a closet with birds to peck and torment her. 

When I was a teenager, my highschool sweetheart was gang raped while cheating on me before being blackmailed into sexually degrading acts for months behind my back. When I confronted her, she had a mental breakdown and tried killing herself while writing my name down as a 'reason' in a suicide note. This has haunted me my entire life, and she was gruesomely abusive to me. There are still things I can't bring myself to speak about. I had another girlfriend that left me for some guy who would beat her and get her addicted to drugs. I've been with another girl who would often hit me or tell me really awful things. 
 
I recently suffered a very bad betrayal and I don't want to give details about it. But it's shaken my entire life. 

I carry myself well, I make enough money to put me in the top 90th percentile for my age. I dress well, I have a lot of accomplishments. But I feel a gaping wound inside of me. I am in so much pain all the time. 

I have nightmares every night. I am masochistic and enjoy pain but I feel disgusted by that fact. I only feel reprieve from the pain inside me when I am cut, or beaten, hit, punched, etc. Its been easy to drink a lot of alcohol but I know better. I don't touch the stuff because of it. 

I fantasize a lot about a woman who is nice to me. Nothing fetishy, nothing weird. I just like thinking about a girl who just says nice things to me, or hugs me, or kisses me on my cheek. I think about a woman just telling me that she loves me. 

I never really got maternal affections, I worry that void is going to bleed into the intimate relationships I have with women. There was a babysitter I had for a short time who was really nice to me when I was a kid, it I think too much about it I'll start crying. I feel a physical pain in my chest almost all the time.

18632,1i1c62j,post,I found my rapist on LinkedIn,"Edit 3 but I’m putting it at the top because it’s the most important. I didn’t make this post to ask for advice or criticism on how I’m gonna handle this. I made this post because I wanted to laugh at how ridiculous it is that my rapist is a LinkedIn bro. It is not my moral obligation to do anything but try to heal for my own sake. I wouldn’t tell his last victims it’s their fault I was raped so don’t tell me I have to report it so it doesn’t happened to anyone else. HE SHOULDNT RAPE PEOPLE. 

It’s fucked up and evil but I can also admire how fucking hilarious that statement is. He just knows my first name and body but I have his full name, the company he works for, and a text message from him admitting to raping me. But I just can’t stop laughing over the idea of making a call out post for a rapist on fucking LinkedIn of all places. 

Edit: hey just in case yall forgot, women aren’t the only rape victims and men arent the only rapist. 

Edit 2: this got way more traction than I expected and I really need to address some things. This post wasn’t about exposing him to his job or wife or anything, y’all have really assumed a lot and I think it’s really important to not make those assumptions. I have a text of him confirming it yes, but I deleted my side and there’s no way in hell he kept his so I’d have to subpoena WhatsApp to get it. I have pictures but part of the mutual hobby I keep mentioning is pictures, and I look damn happy in those pictures since it was before he touched me. A rape kit won’t show that my asshole was fingered several days ago, there’s no dna evidence and a rape kit wouldn’t pick up shit now. He works in an industry that “protects their own” so yeah I’m probably not going to expect them to be bastions of protecting rape victims. 

The reality is if there wasn’t so many red flags and demonstrations of lack of understanding consent before, this wasn’t rape and it was just really terrible sex.

People really want to know what the mutual hobby is. I guess it’s relevant that his part of the hobby is photography, my part of it includes being the subject. That part of the night was consensual, so I look happy in these pictures. He didn’t rape me until the camera was down. 

Stop assuming things! Stop telling me to report him! It is not my job to stop him from raping again! I still feel that not doing anything is my best course of action right now. 

But I’ll scratch everyone’s itch for justice when I say I will be telling people. Our hobby is sorta niche and we all gravitate towards the same spaces, and I will be ready. I know his account on that site, and I promise everyone next time I see a post asking if someone wants to take pictures I will comment and let people know he’s unsafe. We were acquaintances before so I feel pretty emboldened to say I don’t think he’s ever going to engage with this hobby again, I really have a feeling my experience is going to haunt him for the rest of his life and I feel good about that. 

I’m going to start blocking you if you tell me it’s my job to report him, or I have a moral obligation to tell the cops. Fuck right off you piece of shit victim blamers. You don’t have all the context and even if you did you don’t get to tell ME how I deal with this trauma. If he has raped people before and they didn’t report it and that lead to my rape on Sunday I wouldn’t fucking blame his prior victims. It’s such a horrible mentality and fuck you all who are suggesting that. 

I don’t know if I’ll keep responding to stuff here. Most of you have offered me exactly what I wanted with this post, made me laugh, told me it wasn’t my fault, screamed at other people for me and I’m super thankful for everyone in those categories. To everyone else you are adding to the trauma of the worst day of my life, making me regret posting this even though for the first 12 or so hours it really helped.

I wouldn’t tell his last victims it’s their fault I was raped so don’t tell me I have to report it so it doesn’t happened to anyone else. HE SHOULDNT RAPE PEOPLE. 

It’s fucked up and evil but I can also admire how fucking hilarious that statement is. He just knows my first name and body but I have his full name, the company he works for, and a text message from him admitting to raping me. But I just can’t stop laughing over the idea of making a call out post for a rapist on fucking LinkedIn of all places. 

Edit: hey just in case yall forgot, women aren’t the only rape victims and men arent the only rapist. 

Edit 2: this got way more traction than I expected and I really need to address some things. This post wasn’t about exposing him to his job or wife or anything, y’all have really assumed a lot and I think it’s really important to not make those assumptions. I have a text of him confirming it yes, but I deleted my side and there’s no way in hell he kept his so I’d have to subpoena WhatsApp to get it. I have pictures but part of the mutual hobby I keep mentioning is pictures, and I look damn happy in those pictures since it was before he touched me. A rape kit won’t show that my asshole was fingered several days ago, there’s no dna evidence and a rape kit wouldn’t pick up shit now. He works in an industry that “protects their own” so yeah I’m probably not going to expect them to be bastions of protecting rape victims. 

The reality is if there wasn’t so many red flags and demonstrations of lack of understanding consent before, this wasn’t rape and it was just really terrible sex.

People really want to know what the mutual hobby is. I guess it’s relevant that his part of the hobby is photography, my part of it includes being the subject. That part of the night was consensual, so I look happy in these pictures. He didn’t rape me until the camera was down. 

Stop assuming things! Stop telling me to report him! It is not my job to stop him from raping again! I still feel that not doing anything is my best course of action right now. 

But I’ll scratch everyone’s itch for justice when I say I will be telling people. Our hobby is sorta niche and we all gravitate towards the same spaces, and I will be ready. I know his account on that site, and I promise everyone next time I see a post asking if someone wants to take pictures I will comment and let people know he’s unsafe. We were acquaintances before so I feel pretty emboldened to say I don’t think he’s ever going to engage with this hobby again, I really have a feeling my experience is going to haunt him for the rest of his life and I feel good about that. 

I’m going to start blocking you if you tell me it’s my job to report him, or I have a moral obligation to tell the cops. Fuck right off you piece of shit victim blamers. You don’t have all the context and even if you did you don’t get to tell ME how I deal with this trauma. If he has raped people before and they didn’t report it and that lead to my rape on Sunday I wouldn’t fucking blame his prior victims. It’s such a horrible mentality and fuck you all who are suggesting that. 

I don’t know if I’ll keep responding to stuff here. Most of you have offered me exactly what I wanted with this post, made me laugh, told me it wasn’t my fault, screamed at other people for me and I’m super thankful for everyone in those categories. To everyone else you are adding to the trauma of the worst day of my life, making me regret posting this even though for the first 12 or so hours it really helped.

18634,1i0a4w5,post,my stalker believes they are my therapist,"context: this person was one of my twitter followers a little less than a year and a half ago, who then became obsessed with me and sent me a bad link that led to them gaining access to literwlly eveythijg on my phone, including my location contacts, texts, private notes. 

My stalker believes they are a therapist—specifically, mine—while simultaneously being legitimayely delusionally insane. For the past year, they've believed they are my ""therapist"",claiming they are “helping cure me” by trying to trigger me in public, constantly and everywhere. A core component of their stalking is harassment under the guise of “therapy.” 

They know I have rape trauma involving men, so they hire actors off Craigslist who don’t know the full story and tell them it’s some kind of theater production. These actors are told to act menacingly toward me, while at thesame time, the stalker hires someome to strobe their phone light at me. According to the stalker, this is EMDR. 

According to the stalker, the restraining order I have against them is simply evidence that I’m “treatment-resistant.” They claim it’s their duty to evade it through extensive lying and, when that doesn’t work, outright threats. Apparently, I just need to “accept” their “therapy,” which seems based on, at best, a brief glance at WebMD’s pages on EMDR and trauma. It doesn’t seem to matter that I have a restraining order. It doesn’t seem to matter that I have a real therapist. It doesn’t even seem to matter that I don’t respond to anything they’re doing.  

I had to move because they kept breaking into my house and rearranging trash to spell things like “I HELP” or referencing my trauma—things they learned by breaking into my home and reading my journals. I had to leave school because they threatened to have my friends deported and sent death threats to my professors. According to them, all of this is fine because only they can help me. Apparently, I don’t need anyone else because they’ll “take care of me.”  

The scale of delusion is just... wild. And somehow totally delusional but also very much still able to practice due dilligance to evade legal consequences. And i just have to... come to terms with it. This is my life now. Collecting evidence, having deeply uncomfortable conversations with craigslist's finest. I just want my life back :(","my stalker believes they are my therapist context: this person was one of my twitter followers a little less than a year and a half ago, who then became obsessed with me and sent me a bad link that led to them gaining access to literwlly eveythijg on my phone, including my location contacts, texts, private notes.

18635,1hynuzy,post,I’m tired of being alive and no one will help me.,"I don’t even know how to start this. God, I feel so bad. 

I’m not what one would consider attractive. I’m acne covered, fat, and autistic. I was always kind of tubby until 2020, when my mental health and weight took a deep dive and hasn’t resurfaced. I wanted to kill myself for the longest time, but no one believed me, even when I told them. It wasn’t until my mom heard from my school counselor that I wanted to kill myself did she actually take me to therapy (and when I asked her about it years later, she says she never really thought I was depressed and that I was faking it for attention). The therapist I saw was a lunatic. I doubt she ever really got her PhD, because all she would do was do tarot cards readings for me and try to justify my parents emotional neglect (and sometimes physical) by saying I was crazy (I left her eventually around 2023). Then, I did something stupid and got sent to a mental hospital. I have PTSD from that place. Would rather kill myself than go back. When I came back, they put me on new meds and I never even found out what it was until a year later. Then, I did something stupid again and got basically kicked out of school and started homeschooling. 

Fast forward to now, I was on a high-ish(?) dose of Prozac (30 mgs) before I started to cut back. My dad is a gym freak and used to be obese, so of course when I started gaining weight, he fat shamed me. It’s really affected my mental health, to the point I’m back to the point I’m idolizing suicide again. I get that I’m fat, but I don’t know what to do. I don’t eat that much, I only started even eating breakfast because my dad begged me to. I basically only eat oatmeal, curry, and salad. But he’s started to take away my salads because he thinks they’re too much calories (a bag is like 480 calories). My mom always tries to starve me, but jokingly? Like, she’ll say “You’re not having lunch? Good for you.” or “How about we have a nice glass of water instead?”. 

I’m so sick of it. It’s not really helping I started my freshman year and people are already bullying me. I have almost no friends. I constantly wear a sweater because I’m embarrassed of my arms. These girls in my class are talking about pulling up to parties I’m never invited to. I’m never going to have the dream high school experience, am I? Girls ask to take a picture with me for no random reason and then go over and laugh with their friends. 

I’m just so, so tired of living like this. The Lord knows I’m trying to keep my head afloat but I don’t know how much longer I can do this. I want to go back to therapy but I know my mom won’t give my support. No one in my family gets it because they’re all old. My mom’s 57 and I’m fucking 14. I mean hell, when I got raped by my ex boyfriend she told me it was my fault for not saying no. 

I just want to die. Sorry for the block of text.","I’m tired of being alive and no one will help me. I don’t even know how to start this. God, I feel so bad.

18636,1hxdfye,post,I feel so sad when I hear news of how people are dying ,"First I read/saw online when a rapper was shot to death in a parking lot. 

Then I saw a woman on TikTok speaking kindly of her soon to be ex-husband which then shot her at their home. 

Then I read on the news of how a woman was raped and found dead in her home. 

Then I heard someone talk about the book “The gift of fear” and how chapter 1 begins with a woman who was raped and soon murdered but escaped.

Then I saw news of a woman who was working in retail and got stabbed by a customer and she died.

I’ve just been hearing and seeing stories online of the constant tragic ways people lose their lives. And it makes me so sad. And they’re usually young. I feel scared. I don’t fear death itself but the way people die and the panic they must’ve felt in those moments. And then you just see happy pictures of them when they were alive or lit candles at their graves.

Usually the murderers are men. I honestly feel scared of even having a dating app at this point. ","I feel so sad when I hear news of how people are dying  First I read/saw online when a rapper was shot to death in a parking lot.

18638,1hv5j9h,post,I'm a product of rape (Update),"Hello, it's me again from my last post where I rambled for awhile about being a product of rape from an abusive man, and wondered what that meant about me as a person.

First off I want to thank everyone who commented with so much nice advice and stories, reading all of them really helped me a lot and put a ton of things in perspective.

My update today is a complicated one

I barely got the news an hour ago.  My abusive father as mentioned in the post is dead.  A couple years back due to drinking and drugs and all that his liver failed and had to be removed, than a kidney, than half of his intestines eventually by late last year.

Last night apparently he was rushed to the hospital by his parents (my grandparents) with internal bleeding, where he would later die.

I don't know how to feel about all this.  On one hand I mourn the father figure I never really had, a man who never actually existed but I wished I could have had.  On the other I'm pissed I didn't kill him myself.

I just wanted somewhere to post this...","I'm a product of rape (Update) Hello, it's me again from my last post where I rambled for awhile about being a product of rape from an abusive man, and wondered what that meant about me as a person.

18639,1htig04,post,I think I messed up the family dynamic and ruined the holidays. ,"I know this post is very long and no one is really ever going to read this, but I just need to talk to somebody even if it’s just a blank text wall.

This happened last Friday not long after I made my last post on here.

My aunt who needs to make everything about her decided to basically cook an entire dinner. All she had to do was reheat the pasta sauce and I was going to put the pasta in the boiling water. No big deal.

I was still also super wary about being near her anyway because she claims she’s been sick for two weeks and like she has been coughing and stuff and I’m really not very comfortable with her touching my food. Or touching around my food. 

After dinner is heated up  as I’m putting my food in my plate, a single piece of noodle fell on the counter. so of course my grandma who is always hyped up about things was like hey grab that! And I was like yeah give me a second. I’ll grab it and I finished plating up my food and brought it to the far end of the counter.

I then go back and grab the noodle and I gently toss it on a paper towel that my aunt had set on the counter as a napkin. My grandma didn’t know that there was a paper towel there so she freaked out and yelled What did you just do?! Where did she throw that?! and I was like Grandma. It’s on a paper towel I did what you told me to do and pick it up? I didn’t raise my voice I just said it in an exasperated tone but there was no cursing, yelling, attitude. Just a “Grammy chill it’s on the napkin” kinda tone. 

I was like I put it on a napkin like you wanted me too. You wanted me to pick it up right so I put it on napkin and she was like well. I just didn’t see it. It looked like you just tossed it and I said no like I put it on a paper towel. And that was the end of it. 

So now my aunt…who can’t keep her big mouth shut and keep in mind this is the loud mouth who’s always the fucking problem. Literally just a few hours  prior made a crack about my grandmas premarital teenage pregnancy and like 4 years ago on Christmas Eve had such a fucking fit that she told my grandma to go fuck herself and said she was gonna off herself  walked out the door and disappeared, and they didn’t talk for months. And then a year or so after that got into a shouting match on Christmas again with my mother. My grandma literally used to have a siren set as the alarm for when she calls so she would know not to pick it up if that says anything.

But you know we’re just gonna forget all about that right and open our big mouth And she says to me, “Ashley I’m just gonna say this to you once but don’t ever talk to Grandma that way in front of me again”. 

And as soon as she said that when I tell you, it was like a fucking twig snapped like I just absolutely lost it

 I just started screaming that that  was really rich coming from her effing mouth and that I’m not even hungry like I’m just gonna go to fuck upstairs and then she was like what the fuck did you just say to me you Female Dog Slur and then I just walked off and said I’ll just order my own food. That sets her off again she starts calling me an ungrateful ignorant female dog slur and that she “cooked” this dinner for me the dinner that I didn’t even ask for or want her touching and I told her as much I said she’s been coughing in her hands and touching things  the whole time she’s been staying here like I didn’t want her touching my food anyway.  and then she called me a C word and a blah blah blah so I go upstairs and I start packing my things.

And then like I go into the bathroom across the hall upstairs to grab all my shampoo and stuff and I hear her downstairs telling my grandma that I’m a selfish ignorant female dog slur and that she hopes I fucking choke on her food and my grandma was like stop it you don’t mean that and she said yeah I do. I hope she fucking chokes and that’s when I screamed downstairs for her to keep my name out of her fucking mouth. Just shut the fuck up for a change. And she starts telling my grandma she was just “standing up for her” and yelling again up the stairs at me.

I’m just  shrieking like I’ve never shrieked before to just be left the fuck alone and for her to stop fucking talking about me

But then, at this point, I remember that I have my shit in the washing machine though, so I can’t go anywhere immediately anyways. Because I had put them  in the wash before these events went down. 🤦‍♀️


So I wait a little while for shit to calm down and then I go downstairs to put my stuff in the dryer. As I go to take out a blanket that had literally been in the dryer for like an hour and a half at this point, and of course my aunt comes over and tells me that it’s not fucking dry to leave it alone and I told her it’s been going for  over an hour and I touched it and I was like it’s dry. You just don’t want me to put my shit in the fucking dryer and then she was like leave it the fuck alone and I just put it back in there. It’s not dry yet that’s Grandma’s

OK like whatever and then the whole time she’s saying shit like you better wash the bathroom you better clean the bathroom you better make sure that everything is clean and you better clean up after yourself and I’m like will You please just shut the fuck up. PLEASE. (the bathroom was also very clean. There was just a tiny bit of baby powder on the bathmat) and that was what she was melting down about for me to “clean”. 


that started her up again until my grandma told us both to just shut up so then I went back upstairs after that and then I waited like another 45-60 minutes and then when I went downstairs to see if I could put my stuff in the dryer low and behold, my clothes were in the dryer.  

My aunt  she was like “yeah I put them in for you because I’m the A-hole that did it for you ”.  she always has to make things about her like she’s a damn martyr. 

meanwhile, as she’s doing all this so she’s blocked me on fucking Facebook by the way like literally less than 20 minutes after the fucking argument started. Which I only knew because I was messaging my friend on messenger as it was happening and noticed that my Aunt was no longer green, so I just kind of clicked it as a hunch and saw that I’ve been blocked lol

 so you know real mature for a fucking 51-year-old woman in the first place like the whole thing was just absolutely bonkers.  like…I don’t even know what it was the fuck about I really don’t even know . Well actually, yeah I do know . She’s always been one of the black sheep of the family (her snd my mother) and now that my grandparents are sick and need her around. She’s very big on “being needed” so I guess she thought by snapping at me it would somehow elevate her in my grandmas eyes.  The “hero who is standing up for her”.

I haven’t lived at home in almost 10 years so whenever I come visit, it’s usually a vacation but of course I still offer to help out and do what I can but 99% of the time they usually tell me not to worry about it because they have very specific ways of doing things. And since I don’t live there, I can’t really anticipate the needs of the house because I literally don’t live there. I don’t know their routine and what they do. But it doesn’t mean that I won’t help like I’ve thrown laundry in the wash. I do dishes when I visit. 

The only thing  is my grandma has always still treated me like a little girl. She wouldn’t even let me put pasta in the pot of water because she “didn’t want me to burn myself “. I’m 35 years old and I make pasta and other foods routinely by myself and have for many years, but it makes her feel better to help me. I guess ? So me and my grandfather just don’t argue with her and just let her do it .

But this always upsets my aunt when she’s around and she’ll constantly make snide remarks like  “ why don’t you have Ashley make your drink for you and then she’ll kind of smirk at me while my grandfather will give her a look . 

Or hey, why don’t you have Ashley let the dogs out or Ashley do this and I’ll even tell them I really don’t mind helping and they’ll just look at her and tell her that they told her to do it so just do it . 

They’ve not always been the kindest to her and I genuinely understand that, but I didn’t ask to be put up on this weird fucking pedestal either where I was supposed to turn out to be the golden child and everybody’s Savior where they could “get things right this time“ according to the letter that they wrote my aunt years ago. 




And then I had told  my friend about this all as it was happening in real time and she was just absolutely shocked. This is a girl born and raised in the south who has literally fist fought her dad in a fight lol and even she had a really good Christmas and she was shocked at how much more dysfunctional this was than her family and I told her it’s because everyone thinks that because we have money that we’re some perfect little family, but it’s because we wear masks around people. Everything is “private”.


Now of course my aunt still had to get the last word because once the Uber got there, I just packed up my things and left. I didn’t even say a word to anybody. because I’m just I’m done. my heart was fucking pounding. I was on the verge of a  panic attack. But as I’m bringing my stuff out the door, she yells “oh really you’re just gonna leave without saying goodbye to them”?!” And then just watches me leave out the glass door. 


And it’s just……it’s tiring because all I’ve heard for the last like 15+years if not longer is that I need to think of Grandma and Papa. Grandma and Papa are older. Grandma and Papa aren’t in the best health. This Christmas could be their last Christmas. Grandma and Papa sacrificed everything for you.

All I’ve heard for years is to think about them and appreciate what they do and all this and it’s like I do appreciate what they do, but they’re not the only ones that matter???

I still remember clear as day when I was 14 years old when I was sent to an emotional growth boarding school called Boulder Creek Academy.  when you’re a teenager you don’t really know what the fuck is going on in your head. (my grandparents were basically tricked into sending me there after I had four hospitalizations inpatient in a psychiatric unit for self harm)  I had been raped multiple times at this point, but  my family didn’t know about it. They only knew about one man who was 21 when I was 13 and just the bullying and the mental health. My grandma came to visit with one of her friends who was ironically named Karen.


this woman sits me down and tells me that I’m being selfish and I need to think about my grandmother and everything she does for me. 

like I can just wish away my depression and my suicidal thoughts and at the time had undiagnosed ADHD and autism that has since been clinically diagnosed. But no I just needed to fucking get myself together and not be so selfish because you know…..my grandma.


It’s never about me and my mental health. It’s always how my problems are affecting everybody else and I need to think of them.

 my  agoraphobic ass drove myself  20 hours to New Hampshire all the way because I wanted to see my family. I didn’t even wanna come this year, but my Papa was diagnosed with Parkinson’s like a year ago and I know my grandma isn’t in the best health. so I came because I love them and I put my shit aside because I WANTED to see them and have a happy holiday. and then I get here and this is what happens. Remarks about my weight, my mom being a lunatic, my aunt being. Lunatic. And then when I attempted to reach out to my other Aunt, just so I could have someone to talk to who is Aunt N’s sister All she says is she doesn’t wanna get involved and she’s not getting involved in it and to think of my grandparents. 

But of course, when my mom or aunt N do something to her or piss her off she’ll vent to everybody else, but then when it comes time to me to just need someone to talk to suddenly it’s “I’m not getting involved”. Yeah….good talk. 

So I left. Maybe someone can come and visit me for a change instead of putting it all on me to need to take trips up there. My grandparents came down back in 2016 for a couple days to bring some furniture and stay for Thanksgiving. They ended up leaving their trip three days early because “there’s nothing to do here“ and my grandma “saw a homeless person and it made her feel bad”.

And then my aunt and her wife can go on a cruise to France in Italy and they went on a trip to Ireland, but they can’t take a flight or road trip to Alabama. I live in mobile y’all not Cullman. I live near Fairhope and orange beach and gulf shores and golf courses and restaurants. My aunt and her wife like golfing and my family loves seafood and the beach. There’s plenty they could see and do.

They just don’t like it here because it’s “Alabama”.  So I’m the one who is always forced to go up there every winter.

I am done.
","I think I messed up the family dynamic and ruined the holidays.  I know this post is very long and no one is really ever going to read this, but I just need to talk to somebody even if it’s just a blank text wall.

This happened last Friday not long after I made my last post on here.

My aunt who needs to make everything about her decided to basically cook an entire dinner. All she had to do was reheat the pasta sauce and I was going to put the pasta in the boiling water. No big deal.

I was still also super wary about being near her anyway because she claims she’s been sick for two weeks and like she has been coughing and stuff and I’m really not very comfortable with her touching my food. Or touching around my food. 

After dinner is heated up  as I’m putting my food in my plate, a single piece of noodle fell on the counter. so of course my grandma who is always hyped up about things was like hey grab that! And I was like yeah give me a second. I’ll grab it and I finished plating up my food and brought it to the far end of the counter.

I then go back and grab the noodle and I gently toss it on a paper towel that my aunt had set on the counter as a napkin. My grandma didn’t know that there was a paper towel there so she freaked out and yelled What did you just do?! Where did she throw that?! and I was like Grandma. It’s on a paper towel I did what you told me to do and pick it up? I didn’t raise my voice I just said it in an exasperated tone but there was no cursing, yelling, attitude. Just a “Grammy chill it’s on the napkin” kinda tone. 

I was like I put it on a napkin like you wanted me too. You wanted me to pick it up right so I put it on napkin and she was like well. I just didn’t see it. It looked like you just tossed it and I said no like I put it on a paper towel. And that was the end of it. 

So now my aunt…who can’t keep her big mouth shut and keep in mind this is the loud mouth who’s always the fucking problem. Literally just a few hours  prior made a crack about my grandmas premarital teenage pregnancy and like 4 years ago on Christmas Eve had such a fucking fit that she told my grandma to go fuck herself and said she was gonna off herself  walked out the door and disappeared, and they didn’t talk for months. And then a year or so after that got into a shouting match on Christmas again with my mother. My grandma literally used to have a siren set as the alarm for when she calls so she would know not to pick it up if that says anything.

But you know we’re just gonna forget all about that right and open our big mouth And she says to me, “Ashley I’m just gonna say this to you once but don’t ever talk to Grandma that way in front of me again”. 

And as soon as she said that when I tell you, it was like a fucking twig snapped like I just absolutely lost it

 I just started screaming that that  was really rich coming from her effing mouth and that I’m not even hungry like I’m just gonna go to fuck upstairs and then she was like what the fuck did you just say to me you Female Dog Slur and then I just walked off and said I’ll just order my own food. That sets her off again she starts calling me an ungrateful ignorant female dog slur and that she “cooked” this dinner for me the dinner that I didn’t even ask for or want her touching and I told her as much I said she’s been coughing in her hands and touching things  the whole time she’s been staying here like I didn’t want her touching my food anyway.  and then she called me a C word and a blah blah blah so I go upstairs and I start packing my things.

And then like I go into the bathroom across the hall upstairs to grab all my shampoo and stuff and I hear her downstairs telling my grandma that I’m a selfish ignorant female dog slur and that she hopes I fucking choke on her food and my grandma was like stop it you don’t mean that and she said yeah I do. I hope she fucking chokes and that’s when I screamed downstairs for her to keep my name out of her fucking mouth. Just shut the fuck up for a change. And she starts telling my grandma she was just “standing up for her” and yelling again up the stairs at me.

I’m just  shrieking like I’ve never shrieked before to just be left the fuck alone and for her to stop fucking talking about me

But then, at this point, I remember that I have my shit in the washing machine though, so I can’t go anywhere immediately anyways. Because I had put them  in the wash before these events went down. 🤦‍♀️


So I wait a little while for shit to calm down and then I go downstairs to put my stuff in the dryer. As I go to take out a blanket that had literally been in the dryer for like an hour and a half at this point, and of course my aunt comes over and tells me that it’s not fucking dry to leave it alone and I told her it’s been going for  over an hour and I touched it and I was like it’s dry. You just don’t want me to put my shit in the fucking dryer and then she was like leave it the fuck alone and I just put it back in there. It’s not dry yet that’s Grandma’s

OK like whatever and then the whole time she’s saying shit like you better wash the bathroom you better clean the bathroom you better make sure that everything is clean and you better clean up after yourself and I’m like will You please just shut the fuck up. PLEASE. (the bathroom was also very clean. There was just a tiny bit of baby powder on the bathmat) and that was what she was melting down about for me to “clean”. 


that started her up again until my grandma told us both to just shut up so then I went back upstairs after that and then I waited like another 45-60 minutes and then when I went downstairs to see if I could put my stuff in the dryer low and behold, my clothes were in the dryer.  

My aunt  she was like “yeah I put them in for you because I’m the A-hole that did it for you ”.  she always has to make things about her like she’s a damn martyr. 

meanwhile, as she’s doing all this so she’s blocked me on fucking Facebook by the way like literally less than 20 minutes after the fucking argument started. Which I only knew because I was messaging my friend on messenger as it was happening and noticed that my Aunt was no longer green, so I just kind of clicked it as a hunch and saw that I’ve been blocked lol

 so you know real mature for a fucking 51-year-old woman in the first place like the whole thing was just absolutely bonkers.  like…I don’t even know what it was the fuck about I really don’t even know . Well actually, yeah I do know . She’s always been one of the black sheep of the family (her snd my mother) and now that my grandparents are sick and need her around. She’s very big on “being needed” so I guess she thought by snapping at me it would somehow elevate her in my grandmas eyes.  The “hero who is standing up for her”.

I haven’t lived at home in almost 10 years so whenever I come visit, it’s usually a vacation but of course I still offer to help out and do what I can but 99% of the time they usually tell me not to worry about it because they have very specific ways of doing things.

18641,1hs8zbd,post,I learned something terrible about my mother and grandmother.,"I recently learned an incredibly dark secret about the maternal side of my family that is just wearing down my mind. I feel like I can't think about anything else right now and am hoping that by posting this on a throwaway that I can feel some sort of relief. 

Not too long ago, my mother and grandmother got into some kind of heated political arguement, I wasn't there at the time, but it seemed to greatly upset my mother. Because she afterward decided to cut contact with her mother. It seemed like a really silly thing to end a relationship with your own mother over but then she got me and my siblings together and told us the real underlying reason that she would be cutting contact. 

My mother was sexually abused and raped by a member of her stepfather's family at a young age and my grandmother knew about it since the first day but let it happen for years afterwards. Even now the anger and resentment I feel is barely contained. I've been staring off into space most of my time at work and everyone is noticing and asking if I'm okay. I've never been good at conveying emotion to those around me but I have never wanted to say no more than I have at those moments, but it's not like I can confide in them about what is going on. I genuinely think of myself as a decent person. I have made my share of mistakes in life but I have never physically hurt or gotten violent with another person. But right now I feel like I could punch a hole through my wall and the head of whoever the fuck would touch my mom.

And then there is my grandmother. It is the greatest betrayal of character that I have ever experienced. She was like a 3rd parent to me growing up, she has supported me emotionally more than anyone else in my life and has helped me get a head start financially. She is the person that I would turn to if things ever got really bad. If you had asked me several days ago about her, I would describe to you the nicest, most amazing, and empathetic person you could imagine. But I don't know how to go on in my relationship with her after knowing what I now know. I spoke with her for the first time today after the sit down with my mom and it took everything I had to not scream into the phone.

It has been hard to sleep, hard to think, hard to do anything besides the bare minimum right now. I have suffered from pretty intense anxiety most of my life and anytime that I am not occupied with something my mind starts racing a million miles per hour trying to rationalize all of this. But I can't. My grandmother did something that is unspeakable in my mind and no matter how much others might praise her for her altrusim I can't look past the silence she had for my mother's unspeakable pain.","I learned something terrible about my mother and grandmother.

18642,1hs77v8,post,Just going vent out here because I have no body to talk to,"I'm a male 26 years old.

My parents abused me physically and called me everything in the book ""A mistake, I wish you were never born, failure, shame for the family, etc"" since I could remember and never had any kind of love from my family or anybody else for that matter. When I was 6 I met a girl around my age let's call her Sarah, she was the only person who made me laugh and smile at the time, always there when I needed to cry because my father will choke me if I did. She was my escape from the hell I was living.

Four years passed and on my 10th birthday I went to Sarah house, her mother came out crying and when she saw me she yelled at me to go away before she kill me. The next day I saw Sarah brother and he explained to me that Sarah had a car accident the other day and died when she was going to get me a gift for my birthday and their mother blame me for her death. I went into a deep depression that day and haven't fully recovered to this day. Before that incident I tried everything to impress my parents and win their affection but nothing worked, after what happened to Sarah I stopped trying because it doesn't worth it. I can't help but feel guilty for her death to this day. My birthday is the worst day for me.

Two years later, I was alone at home with my brother and cousin, they sexually harassed me and raped me. It continued for a month before my mother discovered, what does she do? Beat me up and few bones got broken and it had to heal by itself because no one took me to the hospital. A few weeks later I tried to poison my family but those cockroachs didn't even get sick.

Four years later, the abuse from my parents only got worse and worse, I still have scars and burn marks from the time. I couldn't take it anymore and tried to take my life twice unfortunately failed both of them. After my parents discovered my suicide attempts they disowned me. 16 years old in the streets alone, I didn't know what to do, I didn't know where to go, just wondering aimlessly. After half a day of walking I got back to my senses, my legs are barely holding themselves, thirsty, hungry, dirty, tired. I fell to the ground and immediately fell asleep, more like fainted. After I don't know how long I woke up I was dying from hunger and thirst at this point. I tried everything to get something to eat or drink, but all went in vale. Seeing that nobody will help me I decided to steal. It was the only way to survive. I don't know why I suddenly got that love for life again. But it was good when it lasted.

When I turned 18 I finally got a job, it was enough to rent me a cheap apartment which only had a mattress a pillow and a blank, but I didn't complain at all, I finally got roof above my head and something to sleep on. I also met a new friend let's call him Simon.

I continue living like that for 3 years, before getting a better job, it seemed like life finally getting brighter. But I wouldn't be writing this if it was that easy. A month in my job and a female co-worker who hated me with every cell in her body for no reason, accused me of harassing her, I tried to defend myself but no one listened to me, I got fired and the police got called, nothing happened for the lack of evidence. The only person that believed me is Simon and he let me life with him for a while until I get a new job. After a few months I finally found a new job but me and Simon decided to be roommates because it will be easier if we split the rent.

Now to the present, Simon took his life two weeks ago and I'm still processing it. Now I'm back to the starting point, alone, confused, tired, depressed. I don't know what to do. No matter how much effort I put in I go back to the same place. They say hard work pay off but that didn't work for me. They say God loves everyone but it seems like even God abandoned me. I just want it to end.","Just going vent out here because I have no body to talk to I'm a male 26 years old.

My parents abused me physically and called me everything in the book ""A mistake, I wish you were never born, failure, shame for the family, etc"" since I could remember and never had any kind of love from my family or anybody else for that matter. When I was 6 I met a girl around my age let's call her Sarah, she was the only person who made me laugh and smile at the time, always there when I needed to cry because my father will choke me if I did. She was my escape from the hell I was living.

Four years passed and on my 10th birthday I went to Sarah house, her mother came out crying and when she saw me she yelled at me to go away before she kill me. The next day I saw Sarah brother and he explained to me that Sarah had a car accident the other day and died when she was going to get me a gift for my birthday and their mother blame me for her death. I went into a deep depression that day and haven't fully recovered to this day. Before that incident I tried everything to impress my parents and win their affection but nothing worked, after what happened to Sarah I stopped trying because it doesn't worth it. I can't help but feel guilty for her death to this day. My birthday is the worst day for me.

Two years later, I was alone at home with my brother and cousin, they sexually harassed me and raped me. It continued for a month before my mother discovered, what does she do? Beat me up and few bones got broken and it had to heal by itself because no one took me to the hospital. A few weeks later I tried to poison my family but those cockroachs didn't even get sick.

Four years later, the abuse from my parents only got worse and worse, I still have scars and burn marks from the time. I couldn't take it anymore and tried to take my life twice unfortunately failed both of them. After my parents discovered my suicide attempts they disowned me. 16 years old in the streets alone, I didn't know what to do, I didn't know where to go, just wondering aimlessly. After half a day of walking I got back to my senses, my legs are barely holding themselves, thirsty, hungry, dirty, tired. I fell to the ground and immediately fell asleep, more like fainted. After I don't know how long I woke up I was dying from hunger and thirst at this point. I tried everything to get something to eat or drink, but all went in vale. Seeing that nobody will help me I decided to steal. It was the only way to survive. I don't know why I suddenly got that love for life again. But it was good when it lasted.

When I turned 18 I finally got a job, it was enough to rent me a cheap apartment which only had a mattress a pillow and a blank, but I didn't complain at all, I finally got roof above my head and something to sleep on. I also met a new friend let's call him Simon.

I continue living like that for 3 years, before getting a better job, it seemed like life finally getting brighter. But I wouldn't be writing this if it was that easy. A month in my job and a female co-worker who hated me with every cell in her body for no reason, accused me of harassing her, I tried to defend myself but no one listened to me, I got fired and the police got called, nothing happened for the lack of evidence. The only person that believed me is Simon and he let me life with him for a while until I get a new job. After a few months I finally found a new job but me and Simon decided to be roommates because it will be easier if we split the rent.

Now to the present, Simon took his life two weeks ago and I'm still processing it. Now I'm back to the starting point, alone, confused, tired, depressed. I don't know what to do. No matter how much effort I put in I go back to the same place. They say hard work pay off but that didn't work for me. They say God loves everyone but it seems like even God abandoned me. I just want it to end.",6,1,2025-01-02 23:01,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1hs77v8/just_going_vent_out_here_because_i_have_no_body/,Neutral
18643,1hs2b8d,post,I am hopeless,"Where do I even begin. When I was 9 years old i was raped by a bunch of strangers. I was in pain for the next weeks, but did not tell anybody. When I was 13 years old I then noticed that my dick curved down and to the right. I am pretty sure it was due to the rape when I was smaller. I developed a anxiety disorder. I am / was stressed out constantly. My main goal was to make myself normal again, so I looked up all the possible treatment options, for my physical problem. When I was finally old enough and had enough money I visited one of the most known doctors in this field. He diagnosed me, and suggested an operation to fix me. I, of course went through with it all on my own. I laid in my flat for several weeks, bleeding and high from painkillers. Some time after the operation, I noticed the curvature coming back. There may be a improvement, but not a significant one. I was and am absolutely devastated about the whole situation. I feel broken. I can not even look at myself anymore. I also development some kind of erectile disfunction. Still on my way figuring out if it is physical or psychological. Have to wait for the tests. Though my doctor says, it is most likely psychological. Now over the last year my best friend developed into my girlfriend. I told her about my physical and psychological problems, but I think she is only with me because she hopes, that I find some way out of all of this. I do not think another surgery is gonna help my problems. I can not have normal sex with her, due to my problems. I did not even try, cause I could never get hard without physical stimulation at all. At this point I do not know if my psyche or my physical inability is the main problem here. I am alone with all of this, and do not know what to do anymore.","I am hopeless Where do I even begin.

18644,1hqvfvh,post,I don’t think I love my dad anymore ,"My relationslip with my parents has been rocky  ever since primary school, I was a very anxious kid, have adhd and am most likely autistic, things my parents werent  ready to deal with. I developed inapropriate coping mechanisms pretty young because I lacked the type of support I needed, and that coping led to bullying, intense bullying, through my entire primary school life.

My mom and dad reacted similarly when bad things happened to me, mostly, they didnt take me seriously when i first brought things up, or told me I needed to stop acting like a victim. I can remember a few  instances of my mom comforting me and telling me I was ok, but I dont think I have any of such memorie of my dad that aren’t also acompanied by the undertone that what I was crying about wasn’t serious or was, somehow, my fault. He always tries to tell me what I did wrong, and gets mad when told that it isn’t helpfull.

He’s very susceptible, sometimes gets angry on a dime about random stuff. For exemple, he once got mad  because i told him my friends (all men), thought men telling eachother they are beautifull is a sign of being confortable with their masculinity, I’m talking genuinely mad and starting to shout. He’s also sent me outsider of the house at 5:30 am in april because my allarm went off too early (I was maybe 10), took of my sister‘s door for around a month because he didnt like her tone and a bunch of other overreactions. 

He’s hit us only twice, the first time you could argue was an accident we were playing a game as a family where you lightly punch eachother’s arm when you see a yellow car, he got annoyed, changed the color of the car to pink and when i saw one and playfully hit him, he retaliated with the full force of a grown man‘s punch. The second time was during COVID, my sister was on the computer, he wanted her to let him on, she told him no, that she had been maybe 10 minutes and had been waiting all day to play, they argued, he punched her, she told him to fuck off and he punched her a few more times.

That was just swept under  the rug. My mom plays mediator, but she loves him too much to truly hold him accountable. 

Over the years, I learned that coming to my parents with my problems was a bad idea. I still struggle with thinking that everything that happened to me was my fault, I told him how him blaming me for everything im going through has severely messed me up mentally, but he just laughed about it.

  
So when my first boyfriend raped me, i kept that shit to myself, some of my friends knew, and when they asked me why I didnt tell my parents, I just told them:

 ’’they would find a way to blame me for it, and i couldn’t live with that’’

my ex  came back into my life this year, and after my mother pushing and proddin, I finally snapped and told her everything, telling her I would rather my dad not know. Of course she told him. His response?

‘’Your mom told me about your ex, I’m sorry, but that’s not my fault/buisness, you need to take care of your shit, I’d offer help but we both know you wouldn’t take it’’

that’s it, didn even turn away from his computer to look at me, acted happy like nothing ever happened the day after.

I give up

I’ll move out when I can, I’m done, I no longer can look at this man and see a father, or even someone I can be comfortable around, that comment killed me. My mom keeps saying how sad it is that we can’t see eye to eye, that he loves me eventhough I can’t see it.

I know, but I’m fucking done.

Dad, if you ever see this, these are the consequences of your actions, hope you like them

18645,1hqk3ps,post,I can’t expose my abuser anymore.,"Before I get into this, this post has to do with abuse, including things like rape. Please don’t read this if this is a sensitive topic for you.

I (19F) was abused by my ex-boyfriend, I’ll call him Jake (19M) when we were 16. He raped me, hit me on multiple occasions, was emotionally and mentally abusive, cheated multiple times, etc. Pretty much any horrible thing you can do to your partner, Jake did to me.

I have finally become more open about what he did to me, for the purpose of protecting other girls from him. I don’t want anyone to go through what I did. 

I am also friends with one of his other exes, I’ll call her Emma, and we have the exact same story. She also tries to warn other people about him.

Emma told one of Jake’s close female friends about what he did. However, that friend went to Jake about it, and now he’s turning it around on Emma. He is telling everyone that she raped him, beat him, emotionally abused him, and all that stuff he did to us. And everyone believes him, because he knows a LOT of people. She now has all these false allegations from her own abuser, and it’s ruining her life. She’s lost so many friends. I’m one of the only people she has left.

Now, I’m afraid that if I continue to be open about what Jake did to me, and he finds out, he is going to do the same thing and turn it around on me. This would likely result in me losing so many of my friends as well, because my friends take accusations like this very seriously. I don’t know what to do.

I’m sorry about how messy this post is, or if it isn’t making sense, I just needed to talk about it somewhere where I can be anonymous. I’m not sure how many people will see this, but I would appreciate some advice, if anyone has it. Thank you for reading.","I can’t expose my abuser anymore.

18646,1hnsf60,post,I am absolutely terrified of someone,"This person hasn’t even done anything physical to me, well they tried but I’m just better at fighting ig💀💀💀 
This person was emotionally abusive and possibly raped me in my sleep like one day after a sleep over I woke up feeling different than usual…
This guy was just scary, i don’t even know why, i acted so differently than how i usually would when i was with him. I did EVERYTHING this man told me to and I fucked up my life really badly back then, lots of my secrets are known now and I’m very ashamed of my past actions
It was just a dark time really, I shared too much sexual things about me and my body i guess that i shouldn’t have and just thinking about it makes me feel sick

I am terrified of this man, i overheard some conversations about him and when i did i would get SO SCARED, just because he was brought up :( 
I used to live very near this guy too
I used to accidentally pass him a lot post-breakup and i remember i would just run away whenever i saw him luckly before he could see me :) one time he did see me and i literally got a panic attack and my whole day was ruined from just seeing him 
One time I was showering in smoking hot water tbf and i was just thinking about all my stressors in life, exams, him, making new friends and i literally fainted and i had to get walked back into my bed because i was so weak and i remember fainting that one time made me look so pale and ive been pale ever since, even in the summer! ☺️ but i will admit i don’t go outside a lot so that might be it too

I had nightmares about him, i had some where i was just walking around my village with him and i started like throwing up my literal guts while i was telling him everything i felt about him and he was just staring at me with a creepy ass smile. I had one where he looked through my msgs and saw me calling him abusive and started screaming about how hes not an abuser or a bad person and i just stood there crying. Another one was of him scrolling through my social media and just making fun of me with his friends. There was more I just forgot their plots and some are just too long and complicated to say here but yeah I’ve been having reoccurring nightmares about him

This dudes just so scary and just thinking about him too much will cause a panic attack and he wasn’t even that bad! I don’t remember much of our friendship but i don’t think i should be feeling this, during the friendship i felt nothing and i was just manic and delusional 24/7. Sometimes I wish I could go back to when I was convinced everything was okay and when I thought he would always be here for me and cheer me up when i felt down.

I’m remembering things now that come back to me slowly, when I was a kid he used to wait until I got out of the shower to put lotion all over my body when I was naked. I remember feeling weird about it but I was just a kid.

He also used to come and take naps in my bed with me, I did not like this. I find it difficult to sleep in the same bed as people including with my current boyfriend. My body just won’t relax and let me fall asleep and I’m wondering just now if that has anything to do with it.

I have had really bad issues trusting older men in my life, I get nervous being alone around my uncles, coaches and teachers even if they have never done anything remotely uncomfortable to me.

I don’t think men understand how damaging the effects of sexual violation are.

18649,1hnbfdj,post,A man close to my father took provocative nude pictures of me when I was a little girl,"I'm 36 and this happened when I was 5 or 6. I don't have a very good memory. I can hardly create a mental image of my own husband and kids, but that picture of me posing naked on the sofa is seared into my brain. I never told anyone about this until recently. I told my husband and it felt good to finally say it. For so long, I felt ashamed. Like, it was just one picture. It was 30 years ago. I don't even really remember what happened. What's the big deal?

I don't remember who the man was that took that picture. I think it was my uncle, especially now that some family history has come to light that he raped my aunt when they were younger. He was my dad's best friend until he made threats to my mom. And how many men would even have access to take a naked picture of me on my own home?

There's some part of me that remembers me asking him to take my picture. It makes me feel like I'm at fault. But I'm a grown woman now and I know that even if I asked for that picture as a child, a normal adult would never actually take it. They might pretend to take the picture or talk to me about boundaries.

I just think about all the adults in my life who saw that picture and didn't do shit. The person who developed the pictures at the store. My mom who found it and didn't immediately burn it. My dad for not kicking that sick fuck out of his life despite having been raped as a child himself. My family exposed me to a pedophile and did nothing.

There's some part of me that wonders if that picture is all that there ever was. Did something else happen and I repressed that memory? I remember playing out a game around that same time where someone held me down and tried to ""kiss"" me. Did I just see that from a movie? Or did I see it happen to someone else for real? Or did it happen to me?

There's so much more beyond that picture that my parents neglected to protect me from or care for me. But this one is the most damning. In no world is a picture like that ever appropriate. In no world do you not immediately cut that person out of your life. And if it was my uncle, then making my mom feel unsafe is enough to cut him off, but not being a creepy pedo toward his daughter.

And the worst part is if I tried to bring it up now, they would deny or deflect it just like they've always done when I try to bring up past trauma. Because the value nothing more than their own egos. It hurts so much that they can't ever really love me or my brothers more than themselves.","A man close to my father took provocative nude pictures of me when I was a little girl I'm 36 and this happened when I was 5 or 6.

He was my dad's best friend until he made threats to my mom. And how many men would even have access to take a naked picture of me on my own home?

There's some part of me that remembers me asking him to take my picture. It makes me feel like I'm at fault. But I'm a grown woman now and I know that even if I asked for that picture as a child, a normal adult would never actually take it. They might pretend to take the picture or talk to me about boundaries.

I just think about all the adults in my life who saw that picture and didn't do shit. The person who developed the pictures at the store. My mom who found it and didn't immediately burn it. My dad for not kicking that sick fuck out of his life despite having been raped as a child himself. My family exposed me to a pedophile and did nothing.

There's some part of me that wonders if that picture is all that there ever was. Did something else happen and I repressed that memory? I remember playing out a game around that same time where someone held me down and tried to ""kiss"" me. Did I just see that from a movie? Or did I see it happen to someone else for real? Or did it happen to me?

There's so much more beyond that picture that my parents neglected to protect me from or care for me. But this one is the most damning. In no world is a picture like that ever appropriate. In no world do you not immediately cut that person out of your life. And if it was my uncle, then making my mom feel unsafe is enough to cut him off, but not being a creepy pedo toward his daughter.

And the worst part is if I tried to bring it up now, they would deny or deflect it just like they've always done when I try to bring up past trauma. Because the value nothing more than their own egos. It hurts so much that they can't ever really love me or my brothers more than themselves.",1,0,2024-12-27 9:36,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1hnbfdj/a_man_close_to_my_father_took_provocative_nude/,Victim

Just because I have this rape fantasy.... that does mean that i want it... or want to be actually forced without consent..and when I said no... I question if it was even vaild enough.


and when this happened: 👇👇👇

We was at a park and at one point  he asked me can he masturbate... and I said sure but then he asked me : to put my mouth on him.... I told him  No.... but then.......He started to learn towards me.... I felt uncomfortable  so I got up But when I got up.... he grabbed my arm and asked me to sit down..( I didn't want to sit down so I didn't)
Then he demanded me to sit down ( I still didn't want to sit down so I still didn't).
Then he kicked me  onto him.
Then he started to touch my  private part
And he was holding my hands  in  a  holding position ( but not tight). Then he started to pull my pants down.
And I pull my pants back up... but he pull it back down.

I said No.... ( in a low tone) It was really hard to say no. But I said it. (But when I said it.... I was bending my back to him and holding my legs ( i think)

---( but not like that) but I just didn't know how to say no in a nice way)
But that's how I said it. 

( And this is why I felt like I confused him)--Because how I did my back to him when I said no.

After I said “No” ( in a low Tone) he said that he was “gonna put it in.” and I felt him trying to put it in from Behind me. But it didn't go in. ( because when i felt him trying to put it in me.) I was scared and started to yell “your hurting me–-(twice)--And I don't know why I did this but I got up and sat back down—(but i think i was just confused. Then he started to touch my chest and I tried to move his hands away from my chest. But then he put His hand right back on them. And it was a point  where I was struggling with him and (I tripped alittle ) and when he so me tripped—he tried to force me down on the bench and he did. (BUT I THINK HE HEARD SOMEONE IN THE AREA.) Because  he let me go and grabbed my bag that had my personal stuff in it. Like my: Birth certificate, Ssn, and medical Card in the bag. So I followed him to get my stuff. And he went in a darker area. And when I caught up with him I saw him sitting down on the bench. (The darker area bench.) And i was in a standing  scared position. And he basically said “why u acting like that.”---(basically  making me feel like I was overthinking the whole situation. ) so I tried to play it off and at like I was not scared. So I sat next to him and he started to touch my chest again but this time he was holding onto me tight. And we was struggling so much that we fell off the bench. ( and when I  was on the ground  I  asked him can “he not hurt me” and he told me that he wouldn't…but when I tried to get on the bench–(basically using the bench to get up….(I laid on the bench  and  started to move away/ or moved back….) He pull my pants off and kissed me and started to do it to me.

I fucking despise myself for it now(and I did at the time as well) and I'm not sure whether the video was real or not but I'm fairly certain it was. I absolutely hate myself for it and still at 22 years old I just can't get over it. To make things worse or weirder I have masturbated to my cousin once which was around the same time when I was 16 which I instantly regretted after and feel deeply ashamed of myself for. I can't forgive myself for either of those things but mostly that rape porn video, it was just completely awful. 

I think about both of those events everyday and utterly hate myself for it I just don't know what to do now. 

If it explains anything I did get exposed to that infamous ""1 guy one ice pick"" video at around 12 years old and read part of some book which described a survivors experience with being raped in pretty graphic details. Both of these happened at when I was around 12 and I'm wondering whether they messed me up enough to sink that low. The first ever porn video I watched was hardcore as well.

18653,1hlswxh,post,This is my last year alive,"Throwaway account. I don’t plan on sticking around for after September of next year. I am a conventionally attractive, smart, semi successful woman who is charismatic so you’d think I’d have the world made. But I’ve been rotting from the inside out since I was a child. I’ve been plagued with depression since I was very young and grew up in pretty bad isolation. I was raised by a single mother who worked tirelessly to provide for me but left me alone or with strangers who baby sat me and eventually abused me. I’ve had a hard time truly connecting with anyone and have tried everything to fix myself so I could lead a somewhat normal life. I’m allergic to SSRIs, other mental health medication, and have been told by therapists I’m too smart and self aware. I’ve been told time and time again I don’t really need therapy so I’ve been left to my own devices to fend for myself and I’ve lost the battle. I was loud, opinionated, and always had a witty come back but I’ve whittle down into not even a whisper of my former self. I was raped several months ago twice in the same week and as a result self isolated so extremely I don’t have any friends anymore. I cut them all off for one reason or another. It took what little fight I have left and made me realize how empty my life is. My longest relationship was 6 months and have never gotten to the “I love you” phase. I’ve turned into an incredibly pragmatic person that is blunt, discerning, and off putting at most now. As I sit here on Christmas Eve alone with not one single Merry Christmas text, I can’t see my life getting better. Everyone always says that it will but mine has been on a steady decline for years. You could say I’m focusing on the wrong things but this poison has such a strong hold on me not much will pull me back. Even if I found the love of my life and won the lottery, I don’t think I can find happiness anymore. I’d have to have the want to find those things and I just don’t. I wish I didn’t know what being alive was like. I’m so afraid of death but the scales are tipping to feel relief so I never feel like this again. If I could give my life and body to someone who had the will to fight, who’d give anything to have what I have, I’d trade them in a heartbeat. There are far brighter stars that haven’t had the chance to really shine. I acknowledge on the surface level I am in a privileged position with health, financial stability, and an able body but I don’t want it. Not with the pain I carry.

18654,1hlrho9,post,I’m in love with my sister.,"I (m18) have been in love with my sister (f23) for a few years now. 

We weren’t close as children but she took care of all of my needs because my parents wouldn’t- she would do all the physical caretaking for me, even if not emotional. 

I was always a lonely child, I didn’t have my parents around and I was deemed too unsettling or odd to keep many friends, I think I can recall only 1 from when I was younger, and even he doesn’t talk to me much anymore. 

It’s not that I am a bad person (I hope) I am just not the norm? I’m very quiet and I keep to myself, and I forget to reply or text people for days at a time. It’s never intentional but it makes it very hard for me to make friends or keep them. 

My sister and I got close around the time I turned 10 after bonding over video games and reading- we hit it off almost instantly after we realized we might actually enjoy each others company. 

We didn’t talk about any heavy or touching for the first few years we got more familiar, all conversations were either lighthearted or arguing occasionally. 

We lived in the actual genuine slums of our country, and our home was absolute shit. Roach infestation, rat infestation, black mold, several people packed into a tiny cramped space, bed bugs, termites, etc etc. Majority of my extended family were junkies or alcoholics so that’s what I saw as I grew up. Royally fucked me up mentally, I’d assume.

When we got close, it was immediately like we were a pack of rats. We stuck together so close and we covered for each other, made sure to keep each other out of trouble and would stick up for each other. It was like having a best friend for the first time ever. 

We had many obstacles but I think we realized how much trust we were truly starting to put in each other after I shared that I had been raped by my cousin, and my teacher when I was very young, to which she shared that the same had happened to her. We started to open up. 

I don’t know when this started, when I started thinking of her romantically. I doubt it’s fully even romance, it can’t be actual romance considering the relationship we have. 

We are closer than ever before now, she calls me her son and she means it, she treats me like I’m her baby. It’s the first time anyone’s ever loved me. 

I know it’s wrong and it’s fucking gross and weird, so spare me that lecture, I’ve yelled at myself about it more times than I can count. 

I try to believe I wasn’t born this way because then it feels like I’m unfixable. I’d like to be fixable. I’d like to be in her arms without feeling sickened with guilt. I’d like to be normal and not a product of what they’ve done to me. 

She has started dating someone recently, a nice man who’s a bit younger than her. He’s kind, I can tell. 

He makes an active effort to talk to me when they are on FaceTime, he has acknowledged the separation anxiety I have and how severe it is, and they both postponed their first date until I am comfortable with him- which I’m grateful for. 

I know im being selfish, but I want some time to get used to this change- potentially a father ??? I don’t know. 

But I do know how insane it drives me. I feel so nauseous at the thought of them together. I can’t stop feeling horrid sbout it. 

Shes so beautiful, it drives me crazy to imagine her dressing up for someone else. I hate to imagine her looking at him with love, I want to be the only one she looks at. 

I can’t explain the ache I feel in my chest when I think of that, no matter how fucked up it is, fhat is still the woman I love and to think she loves someone else makes me want to tear into my skin with my bare fingers. 

They talk about having a movie date at his place and my throat feels dry from where it might lead, it’s a disgusting thought but it came into my mind and left me in such a panic at rhe thiught of his hands on her. 

He might be kind but he can’t ever be as good as she is, there is nothing to hate about her- shes so beautiful and understanding, she never looks at me like how everyone else does, she never treats me like I’m a freak, she has always found the best in me, and shes so talented and sweet and cute,, what does he have to offer??? Don’t answer that, I already know he’s great but come on. 

I’m rambling at this point, sorry. I’m not familiar with Reddit or the way people post here, this is my first ever account, and maybe my last. 

I am looking into professional help, and I hope to be a loveable person in the future. Thank you for anyone who read this, and I hope you can spare rhe disgust you feel.

Marked NSFW for potentially explicit content. To preface, I’m also unsure if I’m just being too harsh or paranoid. I work with severely mentally ill individuals and I don’t know if I could be paranoid. 

Anyways, my younger sister has always been a little eccentric and somewhat withdrawn from the entire world. She has ADHD but I suspect there may be some kind of AuDHD. Anyways she came out to me as MtF about 2 years ago. Since then she seems to create her own reality almost. She steals and lies and when called out only doubles down. She truly believes the lies she tells. 

She seems to lie a lot about herself too! For instance, I live in a different state and see her in person maybe 2-4x/year. She is very tall even by men’s standards (think 6’7) and she truly believes that since starting hormones she has shrunk to 6’3. When I see her in person she has not shrunk an inch, but she truly believes she has. Another example, albeit a smaller one is that she clearly has brown eyes and straight hair. Despite this she only ever describes herself as having curly hair and green eyes. She believes it! She tried to put green eyes on her drivers license and argued with the examiner when they said her eyes are clearly brown. 

Another example of worrisome behavior is surrounding her dating life. She’s been homeschool by her choice and has a very small social circle. She has been trying dating apps but never has any luck. Recently she started saying that she went out on a date and was raped! I was super worried and asking follow up questions. She could t answer any of them. What the guy looked like, where she met him, even what his name was. Nothing. I don’t ever want to think something so horrible but what if she’s lying about this too? She’s always texting me about interactions with men hitting on her, being predatory, or downright stalking her! She’s telling me now about how she has had sex with a few other guys now and that she had to fake an orgasm each time to “save their egos.” I’m not sure what she means and she can’t give any details. I almost think she’s lying about this too! 

She also has self diagnosed herself as intersex bc she has really long arms. She hasn’t pursued any diagnostic tests but becomes pretty upset if questioned about her “diagnosis.” I don’t know what to do. I don’t know if I’m being paranoid or if there is something really wrong happening. She seems delusional almost at times and idk how to help her.

18661,1hitahk,post,"My ex murdered someone, and I'm feeling guilty.","So I broke up with my ex a little over a decade ago, for VERY good reasons. He had always had a tough go of things - we got together when we were still very young, but while I grew up, got educated and found stable work, he struggled. Some days I felt like he was afraid of succeeding at stuff - he dropped out of classes just before the final exam, quit his jobs for pretty arbitrary reasons, etc. But his lack of success also wore on him. He was constantly disappointed in himself and the world, and by the time we broke up he had started getting involved with drugs (I didn't know that at the time, but in hindsight I was pretty dumb not to realize it sooner) and some really nasty people.

He also completely trashed my apartment and was making me start to genuinely fear for my life and my safety, so there's that. I made him give me his key, got him to leave the apartment, locked the door and never let him in again. Healthiest decision of my life, even if it messed me up royally for a good while. I thought I was basically sending him off to his death, and it was so hard to see myself as someone who could be so callous toward a friend who had been a partner for like twelve long years before things started turning really bad.

Little did I know, it would be so much worse.

As i unfortunately expected, he did continue his downward spiral. Unlike me, he didn't have much of a support network to begin with, and the drugs weren't exactly helping him maintain what little he still had. They also triggered mental issues, that worsened progressively. I know this because he kept trying to contact me. I never replied to any of his attempts, and blocked him wherever I found him, but that didn't stop him at all. When I found out my phone actually received and saved blocked messages even though it didn't show them to me, I checked them and found nearly 150 messages, all some level of unhinged. He was tracking a world-spanning rape-and-torture conspiracy, he had recently met a legendary criminal (who has been dead for more than 20 years but ok), he had had a paradigm-shifting insight into the nature of time and gravity and it was going to make him famous, he threatened to have the police come over and take back the stuff that he left at my place (that I had already had his sister come and collect for him years ago), he told me that he had beaten up people, that gangsters were out to get him, that all his friends had abandoned him, That I owed him money (he owes me a HEFTY sum, but I'd gladly pay twice that to keep him out of my life) and I'd better get it to him immediately or else, etc. etc. Oh, and sometimes he told me he prayed for me and my family to be blessed and happy, which was nice of him, I guess...

He also reported me to the police twice, as he was absolutely certain I had been kidnapped and tortured. A bit bizarre to be sitting at home with a cat in my lap and have the cops call me to ask if I was being held against my will somewhere.

His unhinged text messages mentioned that he was very displeased with how little support I was getting from the police, and how he had really tried to get them to help me. I'm sure, in his own world, he was trying to win me back by saving me from a bad situation - only problem was that he'd probably just dreamt the whole thing. But having trouble distinguishing dreams from reality is not good, and I was very worried about what else ""I"" was telling him in his dreams/hallucinations.

I half expected him to show up outside my house or my job some night, and tried to think of what I could do or say to get out of such a situation intact, but thankfully he never did. Nevertheless, those were years when I was always walking around with a hard ball of stress and anxiety in my chest, never really fully able to relax. I took to sleeping with a knife next to my bed

Fast forward to about two years ago.

I had just gotten off a late-night shift and collapsed in my bed. the time was something like 2 a.m. and I was sleeping heavily when the signal from my phone jolted me awake. I looked at the phone while it kept ringing until I had gathered up enough awake-brain to realize that it was a number I did not recognize. At this hour, from an unknown number - it pretty much had to be him. I let the call go to voicemail, as I always do since the break-up when unknown numbers call me. No message. But as i laid back down and tried to calm down from the adrenaline spike, the phone chimed twice. No text, just pictures. Bad quality ones. I was still a bit groggy both from the lack of sleep and the burst of panic, so I didn't make much sense of them. The first one looked like a picture of a credit card or something, the other one was of a man in his underwear, sitting in a couch, looking away from the camera - and there seemed to be blood on his head. Not much, but like he'd been in a fight or something. All I knew for sure was that I didn't know the man or the place where he was. Nothing about it made sense.

I figured I should save the photos, but my first priority was to block the number. By now I was shaking and my mind had seriously blanked. I was almost afraid to touch the phone for fear of accidentally calling him back - and somehow I ended up deleting the photos.

What followed was a lot of me trying to convince myself that it was probably nothing, that I was exaggerating, that it was just someone who'd gotten the wrong number or something. That it had nothing to do with me. That no one was going to take me seriously anyway - ""Yes, officer, I believe my ex of ten years might be up to something bad... no, I'm not sure what, but he sent me these pictures - at least I think it might have been him, but it was a number I've never seen before and... no, I accidentally deleted them, but I think there was a guy with some blood on his head... no, I don't know where this might be... no, I don't know who the guy with the blood was... yes, I'm sorry to bother you. So sorry. Yes. A good night to you too.""

Eventually I managed to go back to sleep.

I don't remember how much later, but I get a call from the police again. And this time they want me to come in for an interview. My thoughts immediately goes to that late-night call, and the pictures, and I agree because of course I do. The first thing they say when I come in, before I've even sat down, is ""Do you know (Ex's name)?""

It turns out, he had this guy locked up in his apartment for DAYS. Beating him, humiliating him, stabbing him - and ultimately killing him. It turned out the dead man was an actual sex offender, and I am sure that my ex was finally acting out his vigilante dreams, but the police never found any evidence that Ex knew who the guy was at all. At the interview I gave them everything I could think of, and when they said they might be able to retrieve the deleted photos I offered them my phone, which they formally registered and kept for about a week. I don't know if it helped any, but I hope so.

In any case, he was sentenced to the harshest possible punishment (we don't have the death penalty where I live, but it is highly unlikely he will ever be free again) which was a huge help to my mental well-being. Knowing that he is definitely off the streets has allowed me to begin to slowly relax and start living normally again. Only one thing keeps gnawing at my conscience...

The night he tried to call me, and sent me those pictures... was the first night that he had the guy. That man was alive and suffering HORRIBLY for TWO MORE DAYS after that. He had family. A sister. A mother.

If I had answered the phone...

Or called the police...

Or SOMETHING other than just turning over and going back to sleep and try to forget...

It eats at me.



EDIT: I'm so sorry, I forgot to say that that thing that registered in my sleep-deprived brain as ""I dunno... credit card...? Maybe...?"" actually turned out to be the man's ID. If I had studied that picture a little more closely, or kept the images like I intended to, I might have been able to give the cops a name, maybe even an address to go to for inquiries. Sure, the whole thing went down at Ex's apartment, but I still can't help but play the ""what if"" game. I know I shouldn't.

18662,1hibdp0,post,I hate crying when I'm angry at my mom or siblings.,"LONG winded vent ahead.



I (16) hate it. I just fucking hate it! I feel boiling rage, and as soon as I want to defend myself, my body quivers in a fearful way, and my mind is falling between holding my tongue or speaking my mind. This is especially to my mom. I've ALWAYS been like this. *Always.* Every word that comes out of my mouth is shaky, quaky, cracky, and lacks power. I can't control my tears during rage. I could try and force them back, but it seems to spawn more of them. I really can't control them.


I hate that I can't. I know that I have the least harmful way for my anger to come out (which is tears), but I just...I just fucking hate it. Hell, even the people that ARE crying and being angry still have a lot of CONVICTION in there voice. I have ZERO. I'm not sad, I'm genuinely fucking angry. I hate that it makes me “sensitive” and “too emotional.” The words I can manage are kinda quiet and sometimes break out of into wordlessness.

Like, literally 34 seconds ago to a minute, my mother started tripping out because my dad wanted to get me at noon. She said that it wasn't fair that I didn't run it by her (until later) when she has NEVER had a problem before about me telling when Dad comes to get me. Even later. I honestly forgot too. It's because I had to do school work because I'm in night school. See, I've told her MULTIPLE times and she's SEEN it for herself that I can simply do it on my phone.

Still, she gets mad. Slightly pissed. She starts saying that I had a “sarcastic” undertone to my words when I was being genuine (side note: My dad is HEAVILY sarcastic to the point you can't tell he's joking until he laughs. My mom is sarcastic too, but not to that degree. I have two sarcastic parents). Everytime I talk to her, it always seems like she takes every word I say as disrespect and me defending or trying to explain as “talking back.” I've literally gotten to the point where I force myself to stutter or talk in a more soften tone to avoid her taking it the wrong way. This situation only proves WHY I do so in the first place!

I even told her to her face that I talk to my dad more than her (my dad is awesome. He's a REALLY great listener and doesn't interrupt until you're done. Even if I'm in the wrong, he stays calm and explains it to me. He comforts me. 18/10 dad. I can tell him anything), but of course, I couldn't go a fucking word with my voice being shaky!! WHY CAN'T I JUST BE ANGRY?! I want to be taken seriously!! I sound so weak when I'm angry!!! I don't need the fucking tears! I don't need my shaky body! It fucks everything up!!


Serious TW about rape and neglection: My grandma wasn't a great mom to my mom. If anything, she wasn't a mother figure at all. Grandma was really neglective and my mom had to raise her siblings herself. She was raped in her 20s, nearly killed by her bf, and abused by same (?) one. I won't say anything else because it's honestly so fucking hectic with her past that she shared with me. That'd be another topic on it's own.

Anyway, I believe that she just has got something against me because of my gender. She's ALWAYS been leint on my brother's—they even smoked and lost their virginity at a young age!! Of course my mother got onto them, but let me try something like that and I'd probably be shaking in the corner somewhere. Ha, don't even get me STARTED on the fact that I heard her say that she was stricter on me than my brothers. I remember that like I'm back at the memory again. We were living with my grandma at the time and she was dropping my mom off for work. Never forget it. It made so much sense. Everything clicked into place.


Let's not forget the time she threatened to box me in a corner and leave me bloodied. And while I think it was all talk to scare me, it still doesn't make it better. She does provide for me, she is stressed with everything, she does tell me she loves me, make small talk, and take us out to eat. She shows mother love, and while she does have flaws, these flaws have been consistent throughout my life. I've been slapped so much that I remember flinching back when she brought her hands to my face to get something off of it.

She doesn't do that anymore as I'm becoming more of a young adult, so now I just don't flinch really. She's a really gritty person, and she used to come home and take her stress out on us (not physically, just being extra snappy), but she has improved over the years. Still...idk. She does that guilt tripping shit. Oh, I forgot something? “You don't pay the bills! What're you stressed about that has you forgetting?”

*Sigh.*

There was an incident that really left me shook. Mom had gotten mad at me or wtv and she went off into the room. I went to the kitchen to fix me something to eat and I closed the microwave—closed it, not *slammed* it—but apparently a whole earthquake happened with how she reacted. She came out and snapped at the fact I was “slammimg things.” I tried to explain I wasn't, but, surprise, surprise, I was being “disrespectful.” In the end, I was shocked shake I had my fork clenched to my chest as I was completely back into the counter while she left to go back in her room. I sobbed quietly and tried to call my dad quietly to explain the situation. That went as well as you'd expect. She came out to ask why I was crying, caught me calling my dad, blah, blah, ended with her saying I can get my shit and go off with my dad. “Bye!” is what she said. The next morning, she was crying and saying how she didn't mean it and gave me a hug.


The end. I know I diverted a bit from the title, but I needed to say everything.","I hate crying when I'm angry at my mom or siblings. LONG winded vent ahead.



I (16) hate it. I just fucking hate it! I feel boiling rage, and as soon as I want to defend myself, my body quivers in a fearful way, and my mind is falling between holding my tongue or speaking my mind. This is especially to my mom. I've ALWAYS been like this. *Always.* Every word that comes out of my mouth is shaky, quaky, cracky, and lacks power. I can't control my tears during rage. I could try and force them back, but it seems to spawn more of them. I really can't control them.


I hate that I can't. I know that I have the least harmful way for my anger to come out (which is tears), but I just...I just fucking hate it. Hell, even the people that ARE crying and being angry still have a lot of CONVICTION in there voice. I have ZERO. I'm not sad, I'm genuinely fucking angry. I hate that it makes me “sensitive” and “too emotional.” The words I can manage are kinda quiet and sometimes break out of into wordlessness.

Like, literally 34 seconds ago to a minute, my mother started tripping out because my dad wanted to get me at noon. She said that it wasn't fair that I didn't run it by her (until later) when she has NEVER had a problem before about me telling when Dad comes to get me. Even later. I honestly forgot too. It's because I had to do school work because I'm in night school. See, I've told her MULTIPLE times and she's SEEN it for herself that I can simply do it on my phone.

Still, she gets mad. Slightly pissed. She starts saying that I had a “sarcastic” undertone to my words when I was being genuine (side note: My dad is HEAVILY sarcastic to the point you can't tell he's joking until he laughs. My mom is sarcastic too, but not to that degree. I have two sarcastic parents). Everytime I talk to her, it always seems like she takes every word I say as disrespect and me defending or trying to explain as “talking back.” I've literally gotten to the point where I force myself to stutter or talk in a more soften tone to avoid her taking it the wrong way. This situation only proves WHY I do so in the first place!

I even told her to her face that I talk to my dad more than her (my dad is awesome. He's a REALLY great listener and doesn't interrupt until you're done. Even if I'm in the wrong, he stays calm and explains it to me. He comforts me. 18/10 dad. I can tell him anything), but of course, I couldn't go a fucking word with my voice being shaky!! WHY CAN'T I JUST BE ANGRY?! I want to be taken seriously!! I sound so weak when I'm angry!!! I don't need the fucking tears! I don't need my shaky body! It fucks everything up!!


Serious TW about rape and neglection: My grandma wasn't a great mom to my mom. If anything, she wasn't a mother figure at all. Grandma was really neglective and my mom had to raise her siblings herself. She was raped in her 20s, nearly killed by her bf, and abused by same (?) one. I won't say anything else because it's honestly so fucking hectic with her past that she shared with me. That'd be another topic on it's own.

Anyway, I believe that she just has got something against me because of my gender. She's ALWAYS been leint on my brother's—they even smoked and lost their virginity at a young age!! Of course my mother got onto them, but let me try something like that and I'd probably be shaking in the corner somewhere. Ha, don't even get me STARTED on the fact that I heard her say that she was stricter on me than my brothers. I remember that like I'm back at the memory again. We were living with my grandma at the time and she was dropping my mom off for work. Never forget it. It made so much sense. Everything clicked into place.


Let's not forget the time she threatened to box me in a corner and leave me bloodied. And while I think it was all talk to scare me, it still doesn't make it better. She does provide for me, she is stressed with everything, she does tell me she loves me, make small talk, and take us out to eat. She shows mother love, and while she does have flaws, these flaws have been consistent throughout my life. I've been slapped so much that I remember flinching back when she brought her hands to my face to get something off of it.

She doesn't do that anymore as I'm becoming more of a young adult, so now I just don't flinch really. She's a really gritty person, and she used to come home and take her stress out on us (not physically, just being extra snappy), but she has improved over the years. Still...idk. She does that guilt tripping shit. Oh, I forgot something? “You don't pay the bills! What're you stressed about that has you forgetting?”

*Sigh.*

18663,1hi3ag7,post,Dangling me off a roof and blaming me for letting go,"Earlier this year I (20f) ended my 3 year relationship with my boyfriend (22m) due to the immense pressure I was facing from family and friends. I had been led to believe he was somehow ""taking advantage"" of me and though for months leading up the our breakup I defended him relentlessly eventually they won me over. It wasn't through relief, instead through fear I had somehow overlooked malicious behaviour. All around it was heartbreaking and I failed to cope.

During that time, a friend of mine got me high and had sex with me.

It took me too long to understand what to make of it I guess. Throughout all the drama he was the only person consistently there for me and I blamed myself for being around him. I was at fault, in that way. He'd repeatedly violated boundaries but I had a tendency to circle it back to myself. When I spoke to my mother about him before she'd told me I was being dramatic. Nobody wants to be the girl who cheats or rebounds and then calls it rape. I still wouldn't call it that. But it was sinister and I feel like I was taken advantage of.

I've been back with my boyfriend for around 6 months. He found out after reading my journal and going through my phone. He goes hot and cold every other day. We had a couple of good months, but as of late it's been even worse. He doesn't believe me even though he thinks the guy was a creep. He's angry at me for ""falling for it"". Recently, I just told him if he needed to go it was okay. That there are a million other girls out there who can love him and make him happy. I'm angry, and broken. I was betrayed by my friends, my mother, and then coerced. I cry everyday. But if I even so much as express a desire for space, even after the threat of a breakup or a questioning of my story, my boyfriend freaks out.

I'm so tired of the hot and cold. One day he can't imagine going our separate ways, and he wants me to move in, and the next I'm lucky if he responds to my texts. Or he'll ignore me to my face.  A couple of days ago he had a nightmare he found out I'd had sex with a guy a couple of years ago while we were still together, and I gaslit him about it. And then he started asking me if it had happened. Just like that. He'd imagined it and now it was real. I'm actually pretty sure he didn't believe me when I said no.  I feel like I have no one.

I have a therapist, that initially I'd hoped would help me piece myself together, but every time her and I talk it sounds the same now.","Dangling me off a roof and blaming me for letting go Earlier this year I (20f) ended my 3 year relationship with my boyfriend (22m) due to the immense pressure I was facing from family and friends.

18664,1hhzyzy,post,"I’m so frustrated about my country (sexual crimes, trigger warning)","Hi, I just wanted to let out my frustration about my country’a situation (I don’t have people who I can discuss with). I’m new to Reddit so hopefully this is the right place.

I’m from Japan, and whenever I am in a discussion about any crimes people would be “oh but your country is really safe right?”. I mean it is considering the published crime rates and those TikTok’s where the persons wallet comes back to them without their money being stolen. This obviously includes low sexual crime rate according to published data. However, I am so frustrated with the law system there. They do not consider sexual crimes as sexual crimes. For example, it is so common for high school girls to get their body touched on the train. People do not even report this to the police. Even if they do, no investigations will be done. My friend for example, had a men jerk off to her skirt on the train. It is insane. While she told the police and the person was caught, they caught him with destruction of property. ????? Moreover, when she protested against this, the guy said that his life will be ruined if she does so and her parents got convinced????? But this is such a small example. At the national level, there was a guy who r@ped his daughter, who was not sentenced to anything because they could not see whether she had consented to it or not (she was raped from elementary school). No charges, he is probably spending his peaceful life. There is another case right now where the women was filmed while r@ping, and the transcript released said that she was telling them to stop so many times, screaming. But the court is saying that if a woman enters a men’s apartment, it is equivalent to giving consent to sex. The charges has not been decided yet for this, but imagine a judge saying that. It’s horrible. I feel like the only reason it appears it has low sexual crimes is because they don’t consider anything as sexual crimes.

Even at a small level, women is openly specialized so so so much. The school yearbook is sold online, because so many men have fetish involving jerking off to girls face??? It’s so sick. Growing up there, everyone you throw away underwear, you have to cut it into pieces(maybe this was only my family) but most people definitely throw it away in a darker plastic bag so that it is unnoticeable. So many creeps goes through them to use it. 

I know all men are not like this but the number of sexual cases that gets dismissed because of some dumb reasons and the amount of cautions women must have in Japan is so frustrating. Sometimes I just wish that the birth rate goes even lower so that they go extinct😭","I’m so frustrated about my country (sexual crimes, trigger warning) Hi, I just wanted to let out my frustration about my country’a situation (I don’t have people who I can discuss with).

18665,1hh7fr1,post,"My life is so fucked, I don't think the only solution is to suffer until the end comes in however long. ","I don't even know where to begin, but this is going to be a long post. 

I guess it all started my insecure and malignant narcissist shit of a dad. When I was 15 I had a real shot of becoming a professional sailboat racer. I was told by many different coaches I was gifted, a couple of racing schools even tried to recruit me. Dad stepped in a stopped it dead. Because he thought the spotlight would shift to me and he couldn't stand that. 

When I was 15 I was accused of rape (my gf and I had sex, our first. She felt guilty and told her mom.) My dad wanted to leave me to rot in prison, didn't want to hear what I had to say. Mom convinced him to hear me out, but not until after I'd spent a few days in jail. It went all of the way to court, my lawyer broke her (my ex gf) on the stand. It came out that her mom knew how well off my dad was and she saw dollar signs, so they made the whole thing up. All charges were dismissed. 

Afterwards I was forbidden from dating, ever, not that I wanted to. I moved out at 17 and joined the US Marines to get away. I was a tank driver and did two tours, saw, was in combat, etc (not going down that path). First tour I was a driver, second tour I was a crew chief. After returning my second time I was sexually assaulted, but I managed to get away from the guy before anything really happened. Then a few months later I was raped by a guy who drugged me, reported it to my CO..... it went nowhere. But, I did get the gift of CPTSD. (More on this later)

After the military I got married. Then I got divorced, turns out she was cheating on me from day 1...... with my best friend at the time. His excuse was that she was hot and he couldn't help himself. She got everything except the clothes on my back, mostly because I was broke and couldn't afford a better lawyer. 

I moved back to my hometown (Pittsburgh) met a wonderful and supportive woman who wasn't fazed by my CPTSD. We dated for 3yrs, I proposed, she said yes, we started planning our wedding and future together. I thought my life was finally changing. But, we never got married. She broke it off when her parents refused to accept me into their family. She was Jewish, but didn't practice. However her parents were orthodox, we knew they were going to be a challenge. I was going to convert, we even contacted her parents rabbi. It didn't matter, they told her if she married me anyway she would lose her entire family. 

I lost my career to the Great Recession, then I got a surprising new one in the high end boutique retail industry, I still work in it.  

Next I met 3 women that I fell in love with. I moved for the 1st, she broke up with me 3weeks after I moved. She ended it because she couldn't live like a hermit anymore. I'm not comfortable in crowds or big cities from my CPTSD, so I didn't go with her to big events, concerts, and big cities. 

I moved again, fell in love again and dated her for almost 4 years. It ended because she said she wanted to ""live like a normal person"". Because of my struggles, I don't do things a lot of others do. Like I live with all of my blinds closed. 

The 3rd I broke up with after 2yrs because she was a diagnosed as a co-dependent and had lied about her entire life to get me to like her better. Also she would do anything to avoid conflict. After two years her facade finally fell down. 

Then came a bunch of women I dated for no more than 3 months. Most broke up with me because they ""couldn't deal with the compromises of dating a person like me"". This is when I learned that the only value I had as a partner was directly related to how good I was in bed. 

I decided I needed a break and did LOTS of traveling. I was attacked by muggers twice, thank goodness for military training, they were more hurt than me. 

Then I didn't care, I chased people who only wanted sex, fwb, fb's, clubs, house parties. Age, gender, sexual orientation, none of it mattered. I mean why would it? I'm not worth anything outside of sex. As dozens of people have told me dozens of times, I've got ""too many compromises"" to be seen as any kind of a serious partner. 

I do have a gf now, I love her to death. But, I'm terrified of when she's going to let me go. I'm doing everything I can to be the best guy she's ever had, but I know from experience it's just a matter of time before she ends it. 

I needed to get that off of my chest, it's my sad story of a fucked up life. I'm not going to harm myself, or others. As my Dad told me when I was 10, I'm ""just one of those people that most don't like very much.""

18667,1hgk954,post,I lost all my friends when I shared my trauma,"I've had a bad couple of years,  really just awful.  You can look through my account if you want to catch up. In either case, this new trauma was not what i ever expected. 

Trigger Warning: rape, manipulation,  dv, abandonment
Skip to the line to avoid any graphic details

I was raped by my girlfriend (now ex). She has bpd and works with child protective services. I couldn't handle the episodes any more, I just had enough and realized she was just too unstable to introduce her to my kids. I broke up with her,  she cried,  but it was ok. She left and i sat down to cry. 

She came back,  I thought she forgot something. I opened the door and she swung her stanley at my face. Next thing i remember,  I'm on the ground in my living room and she is undressing me. I start to fight back, I can't see out of my right eye.  She tells me if i don't give her what she wants,  I'll never see my kids again... 

I was terrified.  I have been fighting to keep my kids for so long through a dirty divorce.  She had the power to take my kids away. I let it happen, i didn't cry,  I didn't move. She eventually left, I don't know how long I laid there.

-------------------------------------------

I didn't speak to anyone and just took care of my kids for the next few weeks.  Just functioning in a haze.

My friends noticed they hadn't heard from me and invited me and my kids to a bonfire hangout. This is where everything went wrong. 

I fell apart there.  I told them everything through tears sobbing (no kids present). I felt a little better after, just to get it out. My friends are all very progressive so I just knew they would understand... they acted like they did at the time. 

This was 6 months ago. They haven't talked to me since. Ive reached out only to be met with silence. Finally one person told me they all agreed it made them really uncomfortable.  That they just didn't know what to do or say and would rather just not deal with how much drama I bring. 

I has always been told men need to be more open,  to share,  to trust. Now I lost my friends, and my children are being punished too because they loved to play with the friends kids all together too.

I know what I divulged wasnt appropriate or timely... but it hurts so much more to be ostrisized when I most needed support. I only live now to care for my kids,  they deserve a good life","I lost all my friends when I shared my trauma I've had a bad couple of years,  really just awful.  You can look through my account if you want to catch up. In either case, this new trauma was not what i ever expected. 

Trigger Warning: rape, manipulation,  dv, abandonment
Skip to the line to avoid any graphic details

I was raped by my girlfriend (now ex). She has bpd and works with child protective services. I couldn't handle the episodes any more, I just had enough and realized she was just too unstable to introduce her to my kids. I broke up with her,  she cried,  but it was ok. She left and i sat down to cry. 

She came back,  I thought she forgot something. I opened the door and she swung her stanley at my face. Next thing i remember,  I'm on the ground in my living room and she is undressing me. I start to fight back, I can't see out of my right eye.  She tells me if i don't give her what she wants,  I'll never see my kids again... 

I was terrified.  I have been fighting to keep my kids for so long through a dirty divorce.  She had the power to take my kids away. I let it happen, i didn't cry,  I didn't move. She eventually left, I don't know how long I laid there.

-------------------------------------------

I didn't speak to anyone and just took care of my kids for the next few weeks.  Just functioning in a haze.

18670,1hfda6z,post,I can't wait for this year to end,"I don't even know why I'm writing this or if anyone will even read if but I don't really have anyone I can confide in.

My ex f23 and I 24m had been dating a few months off being 2 years, and I don't say this lightly but I genuinely thought she would be the one I spent the rest of my life with, we had even talked about the idea of marrying in the future. She was, no, is the love of my life, she's my person.

We have had lots of ups and of course, a lot of downs, and yet, no one I had previously been with have I thought of this way. We were even trying for a kid, I know anyone would say that a relationship that's still in it's infancy like that trying for kids is rushing things, but you know, I really felt right with her. 
She's the first person who's family I got along with and her with mine, we shared so many interests. I'm a really introverted, no confidence having shy guy, but from the first time we ever talked, I didn't struggle, the conversations flowed, I was on top of my game and she was loving it.

She had previously been in a 3 year relationship with an abusive person who broke things off with her but still lived with her in their flat, I took her out of that and gave her a safe space, I gave her the respect she deserved and she respected me. I thought so at least.

A little bit of context for what I'm about to say next, with her ex she got pregnant twice but due to health complications was forced to have abortions or risk not making it herself, in the place of what would've been their two children they got two cats. When she moved in she brought her cats with her, I fell in love with them, and I don't know if this makes sense, but I felt like they looked at me as the father they deserved. 
On valentines day we went and spent the day at the beach together, it was lovely, when we came home we went to sleep. The next day she realized one of her cats never came inside the day before, for weeks we looked for her, we unfortunately found her body all mangled by what looks like a car about 10 minutes from our house, we think a dog must've got onto our property and chased her off. Understandably, this really broke her, and it would only be a few months before the other cat had to be put down due health complications that we couldn't afford to save him.

My ex became very distant, wanted to move out, so I said for her to go spend some time away from me if it would help her. I still remember the night, I was in the area she was staying and my car broke down and I ended up having to leave it at my dad's, she said she asked if I could stay with her but it was a no, she told me she loved me. That same night, she slept with her ex, I woke up to a call from her crying, saying ""you're going to hate me"" I asked what happened and she said she was raped by her ex, and she wanted to come home but had no gas, I spent the last of my money catching an Uber to her, woke my dad up with a call asking to borrow money so I could put gas into her car. I was so pissed off, I wanted to hurt her ex, I got so angry I messaged him and he told me what really happened. The long story short is she lied to me, though for a while she tried to play it off like why would I believe him over her but soon she came clean, I found out they had actually been talking for a long time.

I forgave her though, because while there's no excuse for cheating, in my head I could kind of understand why she would want to reconnect with him after losing their children a second time.

She moved out, we split up but we didn't really act like we were broken up, then stuff went upside down at her new flat and she asked to move back, without skipping a beat I told her to come back.
Because I feel like I'm writing my whole life's work I'm gonna jump ahead and skip a few things, but basically I found out when she had moved out she started sleeping with another dude, and even after moving back in she continued. 
This broke me so much, it really screwed our relationship but we tried to make it work because even though she has been unfaithful I still see her as my person, I made her block him and give me her accounts (which is something I never wanted).
This really was spelling the end though, and even though I had her accounts, they were blocked, I still couldn't really trust her. I had just started a new job so I asked to take a break, I realized I was becoming toxic to her and I spent all day worrying, I wanted to focus on my career which I'm doing really well in.

Well, all that was about a month or two ago, and we were still affectionate, though not as much. Last week, I found out the she unblocked the second guy again and had been going to see him while telling me she was seeing her other friends. I freaked out and told her to block him or get the fuck out of my house, well she blocked him but is still moving out.
Yesterday though, what actually broke me, what's done irreversible damage and really made me realize that she really can't be the one for me, she told me ""you know how you call me your person? Well I can't say the same"" she still loves her ex and still thinks of him as her true love. I can't begin to explain how broken that's made me, out of all the stuff I put up with (because I'm an idiot I guess) that's what really hurt me the most.
It hurts even more, because she's doing a lot better than me, like she never actually needed me, like I was just nothing.

Well, she's moving out at the end of this month, and while for some reason I still don't want her to move, I need her to move out. I need to become me again.

O, I love you, you're unfortunately still my person, but I can't wait to be alone again, at least then I can focus on myself, even if I'll be lonely again.

18671,1hf981v,post,"Oh good, time to go to therapy again…","Posting from an alt account.

They put me on Xanax and I’m still having trouble sleeping. I’m getting stress from all sides. My ex who abused me is using the election to get back in contact with me and every message he sends me produces an unreal amount of panic. 

I made an appointment to go back to therapy but god damn am I so sick of therapy. Therapy after my mom’s addict narcissistic neglectful parenting. Therapy after the confinement and rape. Therapy after my dry drunk boyfriend. Therapy after being held hostage in a bank robbery. Therapy after a boyfriend controlled, and abuse me with his goddamn gun. And now therapy after he starts texting me again, having me fear he’s going to come after me. Right when my life is fine. When I’ve found someone who is good to me this fuckwad is blowing up my messages. Remember choking me? We are not friends. Friends do NOT choke friends, for fucks sake.

I just don’t want to be in therapy anymore. I always do the right thing, my goddamn life is a series of doing the right thing no matter what’s happening. Of just pushing through. Good things are happening but I can’t even handle the stress of planning a wedding or IVF because I’m at the max of stress thanks to an absolute shit childhood and now this shithead continuing to try to use me to process his emotions. And now I have to go meet with a new therapist and start over all the shit from the beginning. You think I like talking about this? That I’m like hey, you know what would be fun, telling ANOTHER person how it feels to be trapped in a car or up against a wall or under a desk having someone rape you or beat you or point a gun at you? That I wouldn’t rather be doing ANYTHING else? 

Because NONE of this is on me. I didn’t ask for it and I’ve done a damn good job of moving forward despite it. I’m so angry at my mom for terrorizing me. I’m angry at my dad for watching it happen and doing nothing. And I can’t even get angry with them because they’re fucking disabled and need care and who will do it but me? So I fucking stuff my rage and care for them both. Even though when it was my turn, they didn’t care. They don’t see me as a person, they see me as someone to get things from or process emotions through. They primed me to accept that and along with the rape absolutely fucked my ability to pick a partner until right now. My best friend and husband are the only two people who see me beyond what I can do for them and instead of spending more time making their lives better and building a happy life with them both I’m in fucking therapy AGAIN. Talking about people I hate and situations I hate. So much of my life has been lived under threats both silent and loud. And I’m absolutely done feeling under the eye of people who don’t deserve their power.","Oh good, time to go to therapy again… Posting from an alt account.

18672,1heg1xr,post,I really need therapy,"I struggle from insecurities, self hate, anger in general and a sense of loneliness that doesn't really go away. Anyone or thing that accompanies me doesn't feel enough or like proper company.  It's probably because I feel as tho I exhausted any options. Well any options I would accept. 

My main feelings of escape tend to be momentarily and mostly dopamine rushes.  Eating spicy food, drinking sugars,  relieving that constant primal urge again and again yet it not being enough.   It's still a persistent feeling and I hate that, makes me feel scared, letting lust control me like this. 

I neglected to clean my room the past two weeks and my aunt came down to check while I was cleaning the basement.  I can manage to clean the living room, basement and do stuff for the pets of the house but my own room just never on my mind or I don't bother.  

I always feel rage when she does this, I guess it's because it always feels like an invasion of privacy.  Then every other time she invaded my privacy, my room, that one time she grabbed my phone to look at my messages. The times she claim me to by lying or doubting me.  All that anger comes back and floods my head as she talks and talks about stuff I need to do while I'm doing stuff in front of her. 

It all came out in too much this time and I fell grabbing my head, grabbing what felt like screaming at this headache.  I guess I wanted to scream.  Her reaction was basically laughing at it because she thinks it's me faking it.  Telling me to stop. 

It feels as tho I'm realizing how much I'm letting myself go.  My only friends are ""friends"" from middle school who never try to interact with me,  a crush I had from childhood who I know I'm just a friend out of convenience , then one friend from high school. 

Meanwhile I trust no family besides the kids. Alot of stuff happened which I can't really summarize here. Basically situations that are stuck in my head.  Refusing to allow me to get my own debit card, telling others about me almost being raped when I asked them not to, refusing to take me to my mother,  a cousins daughter almost blackmailing into sex as a kid, family friend almost raping me,  all the constant backtalk which Im practically participating in by posting this aren't I?  

I guess that's why I feel like I'll never be suited for a relationship.  I'm not mature or sane enough, if someone loves me they need to love someone else.  Because like I guess it would be better that way.  It's strange how I love my friends more then family but am also as distant as possible.

im 16 male and my parents have been separated for 5 years now. they never actually married. i dont see my father because i dont want to; i despise him, so i live with my mom full time. 

shortly after the separation, my mom asked me whether i could have her phone for bit while she was getting her eyelashes done. mind you, i was 11 at that time. i really dont know what came over me but i decided to snoop through her phone (specifically on the chat with her THERAPIST, i wasnt really a bright child as you can see), and i guess ""curiosity killed the cat"" wasn't actually just a saying after all. there, i found out that my mom was writing some kind of diary to help her cope with all the mistreatment she received from my father for more than a decade. she sent her therapist a diary entry and i wont go into much detail but it talked about rape and 3 miscarriages. yes, its been 5 years. 5 damn years and i still cant forget it.

i didnt think much of it at that time because i probably didnt understand what it actually meant. but recently ive been thinking about it and wondering: am i product of rape? i know my mom loves me with all her heart and i love her too, but i cant shake the feeling that my conception isn't something my mom wishes to remember. the only way i could get closure is if i directly ask my mom about it, but i feel in no place to do so. i wouldnt be surprised, but i think id be shattered for some reason. 

i also read that my father threatened my mom to cheat on her if they didnt have sex, and im sure my father actually did cheat on her. why is it important? well, it also left me wondering if i have any step siblings. if he, apart from cheating, left another woman pregnant. im sorta counting down the days until somebody comes and tells me ""yes, you have step siblings"". i wouldnt be surprised, probably shocked, i would be surprised if i didnt end up having step siblings. 

he has been trying to get visitation rights ever since the separation. i actively communicated that I DO NOT WANT TO SEE HIM. but he keeps nagging and it has gotten to my nerves a while ago. fortunately for me, the ""jury"" (idk what to call it) denied every single attempt, respecting my decision. my graduation is in 2 years, and i fear he's gonna come to my graduation ceremony since he had previously come to my first day of 6th grade EVEN AFTER A RESTRAINING ORDER HAD BEEN FILED MONTHS AGO. i dont know whether the restraining order was effective at that time, but i think even the fact that you had a restraining order makes it clear that I DO NOT WANT TO SEE HIM! i dont want him near me, my family or my friends. i think im gonna file for a new restraining order as soon as i turn 18. he thinks its my mom manipulating me, but no, dad! i can think for myself. i dont know what he wants from me since he only cares about himself and i can see it through his actions. i just wanna cry. i wouldnt even with this to my worst enemy. if i ever have kids, ill tell them that he died on a car accident just before my 11th birthday.

18675,1hcb86y,post,The Worst Hire Ever,"Honestly, I don't know where else to post this story, and it is so crazy I have to get it out somewhere. Be warned, it's super long. If it's too long for you to read, cool. I just need it off my chest.  


**TLDR: 20 year old gets hired. A week later, we have a workplace restraining order against him.**   


To start, I work in sales as a door-to-door sales person. I sell fiber internet. My husband is the team manager and I was his first hire as he started to build his team. About two weeks into us getting into it, he hired someone I'm going to call Jake. Jake's brand new to this field. He's 18 with a baby on the way. Big dreams for his future, he's just had a lot of bad hands dealt to him. My husband could see a lot of himself in this kid, so he took him on.   
  
Right away, Jake's a little sponge. He is immediately coachable. He is professional, reliable, the kid's perfect for this role. He's hungry and ready to work every day. Seeing him grow, helping to train him, and watching his succeed has been such a pleasure.   
  
So when Jake said he wanted to pass along his best friend's resume to us, we were overjoyed at the chance to hire another Jake onto our team. Let's call this friend Alvin. Alvin and Jake grew up together. They frequently refer to one another as ""twin"" or ""brother"" even though they're not related.   
  
With this job, after you do your two phone interviews with my husband and his boss, the next step is come out with us into the field for an hour to see if you like it. A lot of people might think they're a good fit because it's great money, but they lack the people skills, lack the confidence, can't really articulate well, or they just don't like walking around for several hours a day in bad weather.   
  
Alvin knocks for the hour with my husband and decides he definitely wants to do this, so we get his information and he stays for the full shift, on the pay roll for his first shift by the end of the night. The next day is where the drama starts.   
  
Jake's car is busted up for some reason, so he's been taking his girlfriend's car to work. That day, he picks up Alvin in her car and drives to our meet-up spot. Alvin gets in the car with my husband and I to train a bit and knock a new neighborhood while Jake's left in the meet-up neighborhood because there's a few No-Answers and Stop-Backs for him to clean up before we consider that neighborhood finished. 

My husband ends up needing to call his boss back, so Alvin and I go knocking together while I train him. Nothing's really wrong with Alvin at this point. He's super formal, saying ""yes sir"" and ""yes ma'am"" and we're all joking about how cute that is when he does it to my husband and him since we're not much older than him. He's 20. Every few doors, I quiz him on the product knowledge because it's super easy stuff to pick up, or I'll ask him ""what do you think I could have done better there to close that sale?"" 

We get down this one street and meet up with my husband again, and we're all just chatting about what he's learning, if he's liking it, when he thinks he'll be comfortable running point on some doors. Suddenly my phone starts blowing up. It's Jake, he's pissed. Apparently he's been trying to reach husband and Alvin and neither of them are picking up. I get him to calm down and he explains that his girlfriend came by, took the car, and on her way out of the neighborhood, she tossed almost a thousand of Jake's flyers that he uses to make sales out onto the street. 

We're all agreed, we're a team, let's go help our teammate. We get there. Jake's still furious to the point of tears. My husband talks him down while Alvin and I pick up all the flyers out of some bushes. The whole rest of the day is a loss, Jake is crying and furiously texting his girlfriend who has just kicked him out. From the outside, as two strangers, Jake's girlfriend looks like an immature psychopath and Alvin looks like a good friend trying to cheer him up. We cut the day short and buy them lunch. Alvin's Dad comes to pick up Alvin and Jake. 

The next day I'm training Alvin all day. We're joking and having fun. I'm getting to know a bit about his life and his goals. I'm coaching him on his pitch. He's slowing me down a bit, but I'd rather miss a few doors and get this kid to be an ace in sales. At lunch, we go to a Wendy's and Alvin gets depressed because he's hungry and can't afford food. Jake gives him his card and he gets something to eat. Lovely friend vibes, nothing amiss. 

The following day is Saturday, last Saturday. I have an appointment with a lead at the start of the shift, so I tell my trainee to come with me. He pitches a mini fit because he thought he was walking with Jake. We explain that Jake is still technically in training himself, so he can't train Alvin. We're also all coached to stay in sight of each other because it's a really bad neighborhood and none of us are supposed to be walking alone, especially me as the only woman on the team. 

Jake is supposed to be knocking with my husband, but he gets further ahead and eventually starts wandering around streets by himself. Alvin and I end up running into him and we see Jake is really upset. After a bit of explaining, we find out that Jake's GF found out he paid for Alvin's lunch the day before and she's livid about it. She's complaining that he never buys her anything and is always bending over backwards for Alvin. It's clear by then that Jake's GF and Alvin hate each other. 

I tell Jake to walk on the other side of the street and that Alvin can shadow him for a bit, hoping his friend will calm him down a bit. Jake blocks his gf so he can get some work done, but then his gf starts spamming Alvin. Here's where I see the first red flag of Alvin. Instead of calming his friend down, I see him start antagonizing the gf and then showing the texts to Jake. Eventually the gf starts calling Alvin who passes the phone to Jake while he's standing on people's porches, so he's then yelling at his gf for acting crazy and Alvin is just standing there cackling like this is the funniest thing in the world. 

My husband picks us up for lunch and then drops us off on another street. As he's leaving us, he reminds the boys to stay close to me because Alvin is supposed to be walking with me, and Jake's supposed to be on the opposite side of the street.  As soon as my husband drives off, the two boys are walking at high speed away from me. I call after them, but they're just ignoring me. I'm like ""screw it, I have a job to do"" so I started walking down a perpendicular street while they take the main road. 

Apparently at this time, Jake's GF shows up in her car and starts yelling at them from the road. Jake goes over and gets in the car to try and deescalate. At this time, the GF speeds off, locking him in the car, and is just running stop lights and stop signs, threatening to crash the car with them both inside if he doesn't listen. Pretty obvious abuse right there.   
  
Alvin texts the boss that Jake just left him, so my husband texts him back with my number and reminds him he was supposed to be with me the whole time. Alvin texts me the same message, that he doesn't know where Jake went. I send him my location and tell him to come meet me so we can go back to work. I hear nothing for the next 20 minutes, until I start getting calls from a random number. I answer and it's Alvin's dad. This guy lights into me saying I'm irresponsible because Alvin ""doesn't need to be training with Jake when Jake's dealing with all that mess."" I try to explain that he was supposed to be knocking with me the whole time, but this guy just keeps yelling about how out of line I am and that Alvin walked home. I tell him ok, I'll let the boss know.   
  
I call my husband and explain the situation. His concern is immediately for Jake's and my safety.  I tell him Jake's not answering his phone. At this point, all we know is that Jake got in a car with his gf and left. We don't know that she basically kidnapped him. 

My husband says he'll wrap up these last two houses and come get me, tells me to get somewhere safe. I am smack in the center of a really dodgy area. Already in the day, I'd knocked a door where the dad came out and beat the piss out of his son for talking to me, right in front of me. There were pregnant dogs loose in the street. I'd seen several drug deals. Half the houses were foreclosed and caved in. Not a good area, in spite of the fact that it was broad daylight. I pulled out my map app and started trying to find anything that looked like a main road. 

As I start walking toward one, cars start pulling up next to me. At first, they're nice-adjacent, telling me I'm pretty, asking me if they can get my number. After a while, they start getting pushy. Twice, guys got out of their cars and tried to grab me. Twice, I had to take off running across empty lots and hiding in bushes until they left. Both times, I called my husband saying basically screw those last two houses, pick me up now, I'm not safe. He doesn't answer either time. An hour and a half goes by, it's getting darker, I'm terrified. Finally I find this ""main road"" and it's just as shady. I find the only business that doesn't look like a haunted warehouse, and it's a barber shop that doubles as a porn store, and I hide behind their dumpster until my husband shows up. 

At that point, I'm done. I am about to tell him that if he doesn't take me home right now, I'm calling an uber because I am done and this is bullshit. 

That night, Jake texts each of us and apologizes profusely. It's clearly not his fault but this obviously can't happen again and this is the third day that drama with his gf has cost us money. Meanwhile instead of apologizing or telling us anything at all, Alvin is silent. My husband calls them each to explain how this cannot happen again and where they messed up, particularly lighting into Alvin because he 1. can't just call his daddy when he's not having fun and leave in the middle of his shift and 2. cannot be leaving his teammates in the middle of the fucking ghetto alone. 

We have Sunday and Monday off. On Monday, Jake's phone is broken so he can't work Tuesday and Alvin has some sob story about how he didn't google what time his college admission's office closes so he missed it and has to miss work on Tuesday to get that handled. Tuesday, husband and I show up and get hella sales just the two of us like the adults we are. 

Tuesday night, Husband messages them both telling them where we're meeting on Wednesday. Jake's phone is still messed up, but we figure out a way he can share one of ours and just bunny-hop with one of us. Alvin comes back with the same sob story, the office was closed again. Husband pulls up google, sees the admissions office opens at 8am Wednesday morning, and gets Alvin to agree to handle his shit in the morning and be at work on time at 11:30am. 

Around 9 at night Tuesday evening, Alvin's Dad starts calling me. By now, I have his number saved in my phone as ""Alvin's Psycho Dad. DO NOT ANSWER"" so I do not answer. Then he starts texting me, asking how his son is supposed to go to work in the city my husband and I were knocking in (which was not the city Alvin and Jake were supposed to knock in and they knew that). I'm thinking ""well gee golly wiz, how you're going to get to work sounds very much like a YOU problem,"" but I tell him ""Sir, I am not Alvin's manager. This does not concern me. I am not your point of contact. If Alvin has questions for the manager, he needs to message the manager directly."" 

Alvin, being the oh so mature adult and bright crayon that he is, gives my husband's number to his dad who then texts my husband. At this point, it's 11pm. My husband is asleep after an active day, so he doesn't answer. Alvin's Dad messages me again ""sorry for the inconvenience but why isn't your husband answering when I text?"" I ignore the message because it's not my monkeys or my circus. This guy keeps spamming us both because he doesn't have the brain cells it takes to understand that we are not on call for him 24/7. Finally he wakes up my husband, who explains once again that Alvin is not expected to be in the city an hour south like we were, he was expected in the neighborhood less than 4 minutes walking distance from his own house, which Alvin had confirmed he understood several times earlier that day. 

This is probably a good time to mention that while Jake is a very bright and intelligent young man, Alvin is about as dumb as a bag of rocks. A bag of rocks might even be a little smarter, actually. And listen, it's not about where someone came from. Jake and Alvin both came up in the same underfunded area. Jake has drive and a desire to improve his life. Alvin is... You can hear the stupid when he talks, which is 95% mumbling. And more to the point, it's clear he's too immature to do anything on his own and requires someone else to talk for him at all times, so this job was never going to work out for him. Frankly, as soon as he ditched me in that shitty ass neighborhood, I was done with him, but husband wanted to see how he was for himself. 

Which brings us to the ABSOLUTE SHIT SHOW of today. Husband and I started in a city about a half hour south of where we live, while the two kids knocked the city they lived in. Jake talked Alvin into meeting up earlier (10:30am), with Jake using Alvin's phone and coaching Alvin on his pitch. 

Husband and I arrive at a little after 1 and pick them up to take them to a nicer neighborhood after we learn our company sent out a different sales team to the same area, so they were just double knocking and getting no luck. We divide up the group, with Jake knocking with me and Alvin finally getting to train one on one with my husband. Within a few minutes of Alvin and my husband leaving, the skies open up and it starts pouring rain. None of us are dressed for this because the weather reports said it'd be sunny and hot today, but now it's raining and freezing. We knocked 3 houses before I text my husband to come get us. 

He and Alvin come back, Jake and I get in. We don't knock in that kind of weather, so we park along the street and start pitch practicing while we wait it out. Alvin keeps getting out of the car, in the rain, to take calls from his dad. At one point, he gets back in the car and whispers to Jake that his dad is coming to get him. No reason, doesn't tell the manager, nothing. He gets out of the car a few minutes later and just disappears. 

Jake tells us ""oh he had said his dad was coming to get him."" My husband texts Alvin ""hey just wanna make sure you're safe."" Alvin texts back that his dad came and got him. We're all just sitting there like ""yeah, this is dumb."" Even Jake, his alleged best friend, is sitting there saying how unprofessional this is, that you can't just leave in the middle of a shift without telling anyone,  and that honestly all day Alvin's shitty attitude had been losing him sales. 

During this, my husband's phone has been linked to the bluetooth in my car, with the volume off, so he's not seeing that his phone blowing up. He opens his phone at one point to check the map app and try to find us another neighborhood, and that's when he sees his phone is going off. I recognize the number as Alvin's crazy dad right away. A lot of the texts are like ""ANSWER THE PHONE RIGHT NOW"" ""STOP FUCKING IGNORING MY CALLS"" ""ANSWER THE GODDAMN PHONE"" As he's about to type a response, Alvin's Dad starts calling him. He picks up, and we can all hear this guy yelling at my husband about how he needs to come over to the guy's van and get in so they can have a talk, man to man. My husband is immediately telling him that's not happening and that if he wants to talk, he can come to us or he can talk over the phone. 

This guy seems livid over the idea that we were forcing his son to knock in the rain. Except that we weren't. We were literally sitting in the car with the heater on, waiting out the rain. This guy isn't hearing any of it. 

Jake gets out and walks to this guy's car to try and diffuse things. He explains to Alvin that he's about to lose his job because of this, that he can't just bail in the middle of work. Alvin cusses him out for not ""taking his side."" Meanwhile the dad says he's going to ""call some people"" to ""take care of that man"" meaning my husband. Jake comes back over and relays the message. We decide to bounce rather than wait for some insane person's posse to show up. 

We drive to a gas station a few blocks away to continue pitch-practicing and waiting out the rain. Again, his phone is linked to the bluetooth, again the volume is off. We're not looking at the screen on my dashboard, so we're not seeing his phone blowing up again. Now it's a new number with a 252 area code instead of 919. This person is spamming my husband's texts saying we stole his brother's wallet, it's in our car and we have it, we need to pick up the phone immediately to bring him his wallet back. Alvin is an only child, so is Jake, so we think this is a wrong number. 

Then we listen to the voicemail which is this guy screaming that we need to answer the phone, stop ignoring his calls, he names the city we live in and says they're going to come to our house, that they're tracking us somehow, and that my husband better pray they don't come when his wife is home. They say this in the voice mail, through three audio files, and through a long stream of text messages, just fully incriminating themselves. 

Now, I'll admit, my Moron is a little rusty, and I'm only conversational in Fucking Delusional, but what I pieced together is that real reason Alvin was so pissy was that he didn't understand how payroll worked. He knew we got paid today, and the poor wittle baby thought that meant the money would be in his account as soon as he woke up. When his first paycheck hadn't hit his bank account by 4:00, he thought that meant we weren't paying him. This ""wallet"" he left in our car was actually him wanting us to withdraw the money he felt he was owed from our accounts to pay him for the 3 days he had worked. The reason they were threatening to kill my husband and rape me was they thought they would scare us into paying him out of pocket because he didn't understand that the sales manager and the payroll manager are not the same person. 

Well as of 5:00, we went to his city's police department. We gave them his home address, his phone number, his dad's phone number, his friend's number, their vehicle description and license plate number, and let them read / listen to all the fun little messages we got between the three of them. And since we had already told them to stop messaging us and they continued, that counts as a cease and desist. So tomorrow, we'll be taking all of this to the clerk's office and filing a work place restraining order against Alvin and anyone he's affiliated with. 

As of 6:00, all of us got our paycheck direct-deposited into our bank accounts, exactly the way we told him would happen. 

As of 7:00, my boss's boss send Alvin's little chipmunk ass a letter of termination. It is my ardent hope that he sees with this first and final paycheck how much money he had the opportunity to make and how much money he just kissed the fuck goodbye. 

Tomorrow, after we're done at the clerk's office, we're going to make sure the person that serves him uses as few syllables as possible so his horrendously illiterate ass knows all the ways I will put him in prison if he ever comes near me, my husband, or Jake ever again. :D 

Meanwhile Jake's been singing like a canary about the kind of person Alvin really is. Like that time he assaulted a 12 year old two years ago and bragged about it, so now half his neighborhood and graduating class thinks he's a nut job. Or how he was high on synthetic heroin throughout his shift today. Real class act, that Alvino. ","The Worst Hire Ever Honestly, I don't know where else to post this story, and it is so crazy I have to get it out somewhere. Be warned, it's super long. If it's too long for you to read, cool. I just need it off my chest.  


**TLDR: 20 year old gets hired. A week later, we have a workplace restraining order against him.**   


To start, I work in sales as a door-to-door sales person. I sell fiber internet. My husband is the team manager and I was his first hire as he started to build his team. About two weeks into us getting into it, he hired someone I'm going to call Jake. Jake's brand new to this field. He's 18 with a baby on the way. Big dreams for his future, he's just had a lot of bad hands dealt to him. My husband could see a lot of himself in this kid, so he took him on.

So when Jake said he wanted to pass along his best friend's resume to us, we were overjoyed at the chance to hire another Jake onto our team. Let's call this friend Alvin.

Eventually the gf starts calling Alvin who passes the phone to Jake while he's standing on people's porches, so he's then yelling at his gf for acting crazy and Alvin is just standing there cackling like this is the funniest thing in the world. 

My husband picks us up for lunch and then drops us off on another street. As he's leaving us, he reminds the boys to stay close to me because Alvin is supposed to be walking with me, and Jake's supposed to be on the opposite side of the street.  As soon as my husband drives off, the two boys are walking at high speed away from me. I call after them, but they're just ignoring me. I'm like ""screw it, I have a job to do"" so I started walking down a perpendicular street while they take the main road. 

Apparently at this time, Jake's GF shows up in her car and starts yelling at them from the road. Jake goes over and gets in the car to try and deescalate. At this time, the GF speeds off, locking him in the car, and is just running stop lights and stop signs, threatening to crash the car with them both inside if he doesn't listen. Pretty obvious abuse right there.   
  
Alvin texts the boss that Jake just left him, so my husband texts him back with my number and reminds him he was supposed to be with me the whole time. Alvin texts me the same message, that he doesn't know where Jake went. I send him my location and tell him to come meet me so we can go back to work. I hear nothing for the next 20 minutes, until I start getting calls from a random number. I answer and it's Alvin's dad. This guy lights into me saying I'm irresponsible because Alvin ""doesn't need to be training with Jake when Jake's dealing with all that mess."" I try to explain that he was supposed to be knocking with me the whole time, but this guy just keeps yelling about how out of line I am and that Alvin walked home. I tell him ok, I'll let the boss know.   
  
I call my husband and explain the situation. His concern is immediately for Jake's and my safety.  I tell him Jake's not answering his phone. At this point, all we know is that Jake got in a car with his gf and left. We don't know that she basically kidnapped him. 

My husband says he'll wrap up these last two houses and come get me, tells me to get somewhere safe. I am smack in the center of a really dodgy area. Already in the day, I'd knocked a door where the dad came out and beat the piss out of his son for talking to me, right in front of me. There were pregnant dogs loose in the street. I'd seen several drug deals. Half the houses were foreclosed and caved in. Not a good area, in spite of the fact that it was broad daylight. I pulled out my map app and started trying to find anything that looked like a main road. 

As I start walking toward one, cars start pulling up next to me. At first, they're nice-adjacent, telling me I'm pretty, asking me if they can get my number. After a while, they start getting pushy. Twice, guys got out of their cars and tried to grab me. Twice, I had to take off running across empty lots and hiding in bushes until they left. Both times, I called my husband saying basically screw those last two houses, pick me up now, I'm not safe. He doesn't answer either time. An hour and a half goes by, it's getting darker, I'm terrified. Finally I find this ""main road"" and it's just as shady. I find the only business that doesn't look like a haunted warehouse, and it's a barber shop that doubles as a porn store, and I hide behind their dumpster until my husband shows up. 

At that point, I'm done. I am about to tell him that if he doesn't take me home right now, I'm calling an uber because I am done and this is bullshit. 

That night, Jake texts each of us and apologizes profusely. It's clearly not his fault but this obviously can't happen again and this is the third day that drama with his gf has cost us money. Meanwhile instead of apologizing or telling us anything at all, Alvin is silent. My husband calls them each to explain how this cannot happen again and where they messed up, particularly lighting into Alvin because he 1. can't just call his daddy when he's not having fun and leave in the middle of his shift and 2. cannot be leaving his teammates in the middle of the fucking ghetto alone. 

We have Sunday and Monday off. On Monday, Jake's phone is broken so he can't work Tuesday and Alvin has some sob story about how he didn't google what time his college admission's office closes so he missed it and has to miss work on Tuesday to get that handled. Tuesday, husband and I show up and get hella sales just the two of us like the adults we are. 

Tuesday night, Husband messages them both telling them where we're meeting on Wednesday. Jake's phone is still messed up, but we figure out a way he can share one of ours and just bunny-hop with one of us. Alvin comes back with the same sob story, the office was closed again. Husband pulls up google, sees the admissions office opens at 8am Wednesday morning, and gets Alvin to agree to handle his shit in the morning and be at work on time at 11:30am. 

Around 9 at night Tuesday evening, Alvin's Dad starts calling me. By now, I have his number saved in my phone as ""Alvin's Psycho Dad. DO NOT ANSWER"" so I do not answer. Then he starts texting me, asking how his son is supposed to go to work in the city my husband and I were knocking in (which was not the city Alvin and Jake were supposed to knock in and they knew that). I'm thinking ""well gee golly wiz, how you're going to get to work sounds very much like a YOU problem,"" but I tell him ""Sir, I am not Alvin's manager. This does not concern me. I am not your point of contact. If Alvin has questions for the manager, he needs to message the manager directly."" 

Alvin, being the oh so mature adult and bright crayon that he is, gives my husband's number to his dad who then texts my husband. At this point, it's 11pm. My husband is asleep after an active day, so he doesn't answer. Alvin's Dad messages me again ""sorry for the inconvenience but why isn't your husband answering when I text?"" I ignore the message because it's not my monkeys or my circus. This guy keeps spamming us both because he doesn't have the brain cells it takes to understand that we are not on call for him 24/7. Finally he wakes up my husband, who explains once again that Alvin is not expected to be in the city an hour south like we were, he was expected in the neighborhood less than 4 minutes walking distance from his own house, which Alvin had confirmed he understood several times earlier that day. 

This is probably a good time to mention that while Jake is a very bright and intelligent young man, Alvin is about as dumb as a bag of rocks. A bag of rocks might even be a little smarter, actually. And listen, it's not about where someone came from. Jake and Alvin both came up in the same underfunded area. Jake has drive and a desire to improve his life. Alvin is... You can hear the stupid when he talks, which is 95% mumbling. And more to the point, it's clear he's too immature to do anything on his own and requires someone else to talk for him at all times, so this job was never going to work out for him. Frankly, as soon as he ditched me in that shitty ass neighborhood, I was done with him, but husband wanted to see how he was for himself. 

Which brings us to the ABSOLUTE SHIT SHOW of today. Husband and I started in a city about a half hour south of where we live, while the two kids knocked the city they lived in. Jake talked Alvin into meeting up earlier (10:30am), with Jake using Alvin's phone and coaching Alvin on his pitch. 

Husband and I arrive at a little after 1 and pick them up to take them to a nicer neighborhood after we learn our company sent out a different sales team to the same area, so they were just double knocking and getting no luck. We divide up the group, with Jake knocking with me and Alvin finally getting to train one on one with my husband. Within a few minutes of Alvin and my husband leaving, the skies open up and it starts pouring rain. None of us are dressed for this because the weather reports said it'd be sunny and hot today, but now it's raining and freezing. We knocked 3 houses before I text my husband to come get us. 

He and Alvin come back, Jake and I get in. We don't knock in that kind of weather, so we park along the street and start pitch practicing while we wait it out. Alvin keeps getting out of the car, in the rain, to take calls from his dad. At one point, he gets back in the car and whispers to Jake that his dad is coming to get him. No reason, doesn't tell the manager, nothing. He gets out of the car a few minutes later and just disappears. 

Jake tells us ""oh he had said his dad was coming to get him."" My husband texts Alvin ""hey just wanna make sure you're safe."" Alvin texts back that his dad came and got him. We're all just sitting there like ""yeah, this is dumb."" Even Jake, his alleged best friend, is sitting there saying how unprofessional this is, that you can't just leave in the middle of a shift without telling anyone,  and that honestly all day Alvin's shitty attitude had been losing him sales. 

During this, my husband's phone has been linked to the bluetooth in my car, with the volume off, so he's not seeing that his phone blowing up. He opens his phone at one point to check the map app and try to find us another neighborhood, and that's when he sees his phone is going off. I recognize the number as Alvin's crazy dad right away. A lot of the texts are like ""ANSWER THE PHONE RIGHT NOW"" ""STOP FUCKING IGNORING MY CALLS"" ""ANSWER THE GODDAMN PHONE"" As he's about to type a response, Alvin's Dad starts calling him. He picks up, and we can all hear this guy yelling at my husband about how he needs to come over to the guy's van and get in so they can have a talk, man to man. My husband is immediately telling him that's not happening and that if he wants to talk, he can come to us or he can talk over the phone. 

This guy seems livid over the idea that we were forcing his son to knock in the rain. Except that we weren't. We were literally sitting in the car with the heater on, waiting out the rain. This guy isn't hearing any of it. 

Jake gets out and walks to this guy's car to try and diffuse things. He explains to Alvin that he's about to lose his job because of this, that he can't just bail in the middle of work. Alvin cusses him out for not ""taking his side."" Meanwhile the dad says he's going to ""call some people"" to ""take care of that man"" meaning my husband. Jake comes back over and relays the message. We decide to bounce rather than wait for some insane person's posse to show up. 

We drive to a gas station a few blocks away to continue pitch-practicing and waiting out the rain. Again, his phone is linked to the bluetooth, again the volume is off. We're not looking at the screen on my dashboard, so we're not seeing his phone blowing up again. Now it's a new number with a 252 area code instead of 919. This person is spamming my husband's texts saying we stole his brother's wallet, it's in our car and we have it, we need to pick up the phone immediately to bring him his wallet back. Alvin is an only child, so is Jake, so we think this is a wrong number. 

Then we listen to the voicemail which is this guy screaming that we need to answer the phone, stop ignoring his calls, he names the city we live in and says they're going to come to our house, that they're tracking us somehow, and that my husband better pray they don't come when his wife is home. They say this in the voice mail, through three audio files, and through a long stream of text messages, just fully incriminating themselves. 

Now, I'll admit, my Moron is a little rusty, and I'm only conversational in Fucking Delusional, but what I pieced together is that real reason Alvin was so pissy was that he didn't understand how payroll worked. He knew we got paid today, and the poor wittle baby thought that meant the money would be in his account as soon as he woke up. When his first paycheck hadn't hit his bank account by 4:00, he thought that meant we weren't paying him. This ""wallet"" he left in our car was actually him wanting us to withdraw the money he felt he was owed from our accounts to pay him for the 3 days he had worked. The reason they were threatening to kill my husband and rape me was they thought they would scare us into paying him out of pocket because he didn't understand that the sales manager and the payroll manager are not the same person. 

Well as of 5:00, we went to his city's police department. We gave them his home address, his phone number, his dad's phone number, his friend's number, their vehicle description and license plate number, and let them read / listen to all the fun little messages we got between the three of them. And since we had already told them to stop messaging us and they continued, that counts as a cease and desist. So tomorrow, we'll be taking all of this to the clerk's office and filing a work place restraining order against Alvin and anyone he's affiliated with. 

As of 6:00, all of us got our paycheck direct-deposited into our bank accounts, exactly the way we told him would happen. 

As of 7:00, my boss's boss send Alvin's little chipmunk ass a letter of termination. It is my ardent hope that he sees with this first and final paycheck how much money he had the opportunity to make and how much money he just kissed the fuck goodbye. 

Tomorrow, after we're done at the clerk's office, we're going to make sure the person that serves him uses as few syllables as possible so his horrendously illiterate ass knows all the ways I will put him in prison if he ever comes near me, my husband, or Jake ever again. :D 

Meanwhile Jake's been singing like a canary about the kind of person Alvin really is. Like that time he assaulted a 12 year old two years ago and bragged about it, so now half his neighborhood and graduating class thinks he's a nut job. Or how he was high on synthetic heroin throughout his shift today. Real class act, that Alvino.

18676,1haz6ui,post,I don’t know who I am,"I don’t know who I am

I am the youngest of three. I was the emotional crutch for both my parents as their relationship fell apart over ten years. My age at this time 10 -20. I became a people pleaser early. I was always too scared to break any rules, too scared to raise my voice. Nothing bad would happen. No one would hit me or call me names. But things were bad, I couldn’t upset anyone. Mum would cry because my older brother was doing dumb shit. I had to be quiet, don’t upset anyone don’t make it worse.

I wanted to be a director. I was good at drama when I was at school got top marks. I craved out a small piece of good for myself. I got an interview at VCA. They laughed me out of the room for the work I put in. I release now I was so good at drama because I was at making myself into what other people wanted to see.

A few years later I started to explore things sexually. Started to look into kink. It was around the time for 50 shades and it had led me down an interesting path. I met my now husband through kink. He is much older than me. Before we became exclusive we had a mutual friend. I asked my husband if he would be okay if I played with this friend. No sex just a scene. My husband (then Dom at the time) gave me the go ahead. This ‘friend’ got drunk and raped me. I didn’t tell anyone for a long time. Figured it was my fault for getting into that situation in the first place. I know better now but then? I clung onto my husband. I excused all his faults and ignored how incompatible we are because he was so very safe. At the time he was going through his own healing journey, I thought it would be okay we could heal together. He stopped though. At some point he stopped trying to better himself. I thought about leaving him so many times but I always came up with a reason to stay. ‘its too hard, we have a lease together’ ‘I cant we now share pets’ ‘I cant its our wedding day’ ‘I cant we have a child now.’ I have been with him for 11 years now. I have told him I want to leave him but he refuses to let this marriage go, for our son and because he doesn’t think he will find anyone else. He told me that.

The people pleaser part of me is so strong that it happens without me even knowing, I have no control over it. Its so tiring that over the years I have isolated myself. The only people I share a meaningful connection with it my mum, husband and son. I know what they expect its easier around them. I spend as much time alone as possible but I am so lonely. I tried therapy but I just ended up talking about the things I thought the phycologist wanted to hear.

I had made peace with the way I am. Accepted I was nothing but an empty vessel, not really existing unless someone was nearby but my son. My 5-year-old boy is doing the same thing as me, I see him do it. I see him bend and say things just to accommodate people around him. I don’t know what to do

I don’t know what I like to do because every time I try something new, I just try and make the people around me happy even if they are total strangers. When I am alone I hide, I hide in social media or in the stories I make up in my head.

18677,1hajead,post,I feel spoiled and entitled for being upset that my family is going on a family vacation without me,"I 23 (f) have a bit of a strained relationship with my family. 95% of the issue stem from my older (f27) who is honestly very coddled due to her mental illness. I don’t know all of them mental illnesses. Since there was quite a few. My sister and I are both adopted. Thankfully, we are not genetically related at all. Unfortunately, my sister inherited all of her births Moms illnesses and a tad bit more.

She’s a diagnosed narcissist, has BPD, early signs of schizophrenia, some other kind of personality disorder, and a diagnosed psychopath. Just the name a few. I do think it’s unfortunate that she does have to live her life with all those illnesses and I don’t want to minimize how hard that is on her. But that isn’t excuse for her bad behavior. I don’t wanna repeat too much information as I have made post about my parents favoritism towards my sister in the past. 

But I’ll just just pinpoint a few . She stole from me growing up (aka threw my safe off the roof and broke it open with a hammer to steal my emergency savings), molested me, beat me, tried to kill my cat, got her friends to steal from me, got one of her 18-year-old friends to try to rape me when I was 12, and once time, when was in junior high, tried to get me to say the N-word, and when I refuse, her friend held me down and burned cigarette lights on my arm. 

Needless to say I don’t like my sister. She has made some improvements which want to acknowledge. However, I just can’t forgive her, especially when she hasn’t apologized to me. And when she has apologized to me, it’s in a way that makes herself the victim, and her story is always tweaked to make herself look better. 

Now since that background has been discussed, I’m gonna talk about the situation. My grandpa had recently passed away and his funeral was last weekend. I took care of my grandpa and was his main caregiver. I went to college and would take care of him during the summers, vacations, and holidays. I loved my Grandpa dearly and to me he was more of my dad than anything.

With all the things going on in my family, I stopped coming home as often, and my parents had to hire a caretaker. there were some issues with the last caretaker so they hired my sister to be paid $35 an hour to keep him company at his nursing home. She was with him for a few months before he passed. 

When I went to the funeral, my mom even made a speech and predominantly talked about how my sisters an angel a saint. She talked about how much my sister did for my grandpa. But when the topic of me came up, she said I would visit him on holidays and talked with him. So completely undermining everything I’ve done for him. 

I also found out that day that my parents and my sister were going on a vacation. I was shocked because I didn’t know any of this knowledge. I should’ve had some kind of idea that something was up. Since my sister’s boyfriend was going to have to fly alone. Which was a whole other story. basically my parents wanted me to take connecting flights so I can fly with him to his state and escort him since he’s never flown alone and this man is 28. 

I found out that my family was going to go to York for the whole week and we’re gonna go watch wicked on Broadway. My parents said my sister deserved a break for all of her hard work. She’s been unemployed for four years. They said they didn’t offer  me because they knew I had to go to work. Which honestly if they had told me that this was happening, I could’ve gotten time off. 

My sister was bragging and rubbing in my face about how much my parents were going to spend on her in New York, as she was promised a shopping spree in the shopping district in New York. My mom told me that it wasn’t fair to my sister since I got to go to Japan and she didn’t. For background  that was supposed to be my high school graduation but with Covid happening it got postponed for about five years.

And the only reason why I was able to go was because my dad had a business trip there and I would be paying my own expenses. My sister did get a graduation gift. She got to go to Europe and see the women’s World Cup final in France. I was super grateful that I got to go Japan even if I had to pay and my sister didn’t for her trip. Since my parents normally don’t do that kind of stuff for me.

But now my parents have been using that as justifications for how often that all three of them go on family vacations without me. Idk know I’m very privileged as my parents are wealthy. But I just feel resentment towards them and my sister. I went to college I’m working full-time. I’m living paycheck to paycheck and I’m living off of caned spam and tuna. While  my parents pay for my sister‘s house and cover all of her expenses. I’m not sure if I’m just being spoiled or entitled, but I just really wanted to rant. Thank you so much for anyone who read through this. I know it definitely seems more like first world problems.

18678,1ha07ly,post,Forlorn...,"I don't enjoy life. There's stuff I like to do, but it's just something to do until I can go to sleep before another shit day starts. I really don't think my depression is going to get better and I'm always going to be miserable and tired. I think it's too late to overcome my social anxiety and wtf am I supposed to do by learning there's a good chance I'm autistic when I'm 30? I have no goals, no ambitions, and no hope. I'm directionless

I think I'd be an alcoholic because alcohol is the only thing I've found that gets my brain to be quiet. It gets ride of the constant worrying and let's me have some fun. But I don't like drinking, it doesn't seem like my stomach does either. So I've only drank maybe a half dozen times since I graduated college nearly 8 years ago. I didn't drink a whole lot more in college either. The other coping mechanism I can think of is to just have meaningless sex because maybe it'll make me at least not be miserable for a few minutes. But I'm a sexually frustrated virgin. I don't even know how to find a girl that's into me and no clue how to go from a date or meeting in a bar to going back to one of our places. I literally do not understand how that works. I've been told I'm pretty good looking, so that means that me as a person is being rejected by women. I don't blame them though, why would they want to be with my miserable ass?

Then there's been a lot of family health issues over the past two months and I really wish I had a distraction or a way to destress. But I don't. If anything I breakdown after midnight into a sobbing mess. I so desperately just want someone to hold me, something I've never felt from someone who isn't my parent. I want to have my hair played with and be told it'll be okay. I want to fuck the hell out of someone because I'm sexually frustrated as hell.

And then I look through subs like this. I look at the news. There is war, starvation, people live in much worse situations than I do. There's people dying young, there are people who's lives are falling apart, the love of their life has done something to throw their life into disarray, there's rape and theft and so much more. And I'm over here complaining that I can't get laid. I'm trying to remind myself that my feelings are valid and I shouldn't compare to other people's situations, but I do. I feel like I'm ungrateful for the life I have and I'm sure that isn't making me feel any better. I don't know where to start to try to get better, it's like looking at a long abandoned building that's rotten and rusted, then being told to fix it up, but you can't demolish it. I don't see how you can do that and I don't see it happening. All I have to look forward to is paying for someone to pretend to like me and hold me and spending another 20-50 years of misery. I ""joke"" that I'll die at age 50 from a heart attack because so many relatives of mine had heart attacks in their 50's. Most didn't die, but they weren't alone. I'm going to have a heart attack in 20 years and nobody will give a fuck. And that isn't really a joke, I honestly feel like that's the best case scenario in this miserable life.","Forlorn... I don't enjoy life. There's stuff I like to do, but it's just something to do until I can go to sleep before another shit day starts. I really don't think my depression is going to get better and I'm always going to be miserable and tired. I think it's too late to overcome my social anxiety and wtf am I supposed to do by learning there's a good chance I'm autistic when I'm 30? I have no goals, no ambitions, and no hope. I'm directionless

I think I'd be an alcoholic because alcohol is the only thing I've found that gets my brain to be quiet. It gets ride of the constant worrying and let's me have some fun.

18679,1h94qrl,post,Does it count as rape if I only said yes because I know he'd be really depressed if I said no?,"This is a throw-away account bc I don't want my friends to see this.

I used to have a boyfriend with severe depression. I had severe depression too and I know it sounds awful but it was really hard for me to cope with his depressive episodes. I said yes to sex and aggressive kink stuff multiple times because I knew if I said no he would become really sad and feel really bad and I would have to comfort him which was more stressful than just letting him do it. 

One of the reasons I never opened up to him about this was because of the following. I started saying no to sex sometimes because I didn't want to. Then once he asked if he could be honest with me and I said yes. He said in a very sad tone that he was upset that we didn't have sex that much, so I started forcing myself to say yes more.

Now I have many symptoms that are the same as the rape victims that I've seen online. Since then I cry whenever someone gives me a serious proposal for sex and I relate a lot to how rape victims online describe their experiences. I don't know if it counts though because I did say yes.

18681,1h7nb9h,post,I hate that my family only comforted my sister when my grandpa died,"I (24 F) have always been super close with my grandpa. he’s like a father figure to me and I always accidentally called him dad which he never minded. I would take care of him anytime my family and him would go on vacations for special occasions like weddings. During those time frames, no one would take care of him and it was on me which I didn’t mind because I loved my grandpa. He was wheelchair bound. 

I didn’t mind taking care of him when I came home from college either. It was my turn to take care of him after he took care of me when I was a kid. He’s honestly one of the best people I’ve ever met in my life. my family on the other hand is more complicated story I have very estranged relationship with them. I started working during the summers and full-time just so I wouldn’t have to go home for a long period of time. And since I graduated, I hardly ever go home however I do visit for the holidays. 

Due to a lot of circumstances with my family which I have written stories about it I try to avoid them. but I’ll give a quick summary. My parents enable my sister behavior since I was a kid, blaming it on her mental illness, and that she needs more help than me. any of her bad behaviors was always enabled by them. They always gave her money and she’s quite abusive to most people around her. She beat me as a kid, stole for me stabbed me, touched me and even tried to get one of her 18-year-old friends to rape me when I was 12. But my sister was never reprimanded for any of these instead I was blamed for somehow antagonizing her to act out in that way. 

I had to beg for help from my parents. If I needed extra help, even though I’m younger and barely out of college, they’ll tell me I have money and I need to figure it out. But legitimately my dad gave my sister $20 for grabbing his coffee out of the car. If I asked for $20, I’d have to find someway to earn it from him.

Needless to say, I don’t have the best relationship with my sister, but my parents tell me I’m being a bad sister and I need to support her and to be a better Christian . Thats the dynamic of being home. Since I was a kid, I always sacrificed my happiness and my mental health for the good of the family. As much as I love seeing my grandpa, I couldn’t be around my family. so I called him multiple times every single week to catch up with him. 

However, he had a procedure done and got infection and unfortunately got sepsis and passed away . it was on Thanksgiving day I had driven in to state the before and I went to see him at the nursing home and it was a hard site to see. I knew he was struggling since he hadn’t been answering my calls, but when I got there, he couldn’t talk. His eyes were just rolled to the back of the head and he would occasionally cry out in pain. When he wasn’t answering his phone, I would call my parents or my sister to get updates and they never keep me in the loop. 

It was hard for me to see and I know it was probably hard for everyone to see. The following day on Thanksgiving day my mom went over to the nursing home after her turkey trot to spend some time with him and I never got an update. Meanwhile I was up since 830 cooking everything for Thanksgiving and I mean everything. I was making the mac & cheese and shredding the cheese and I grated my finger on the cheese grater and it hurt and my finger was gushing blood and my dad just made fun of me. 

I asked my dad for help and he said he would but he would go and take a nap or go to work on some thing and he just never did help . I asked Dad to help with taking the  roasted pecans out of the oven while I was getting ready to go see my grandpa. I told him to take them out within five minutes and 20 minutes go by and I check the oven and they’re all burned and my dad was just laughing and watching plain trains and automobiles and just turns to me and tells me I should probably take those out.

I was annoyed so I called my mom and she said “yeah if you want, you can come over to say goodbye to Grandpa” . And his nursing home is really close to my house so I just ran to the nursing home. I barely made it before my grandpas last breath. Thankfully, I was able to hold his hand, kiss his forehead, and tell him who it was and telling him that I  wanted to say goodbye again. Not even a minute later he dies. It was so hard for me, but no one comforted me.

And then I got mad at my mom because I found out that she called and texted my sister to let her know that she should come by and say goodbye . I never got any messages like that. I had to call her to find out. my sister finally came after my grandpa died even knowing that he was going to die really soon. She’s always known to be late for things. She was crying because that was her grandpa too. So I understand why she was upset, but I was just mad at her that she got an update about an important event and was still late.

It Annoyed me so much because my uncle and  my mom were my sister telling her she’s God’s gift she’s an angel she’s perfect. My grandpa loved her the most.  And she was wearing all my clothes. My mom had cleared out my closet when I was gone and gave all my clothes to my sister, even though I told her not to. I was just so hurt that nobody comforted me.

Yes, my sister took care of Grandpa for the last year, but she got paid to do it . She got paid $30 an hour just to sit in the room with him. I would do that with him and I would run errands grocery shop change diapers help into the bathroom bathe him make sure he gets his meds. not a single thank you because to me this is my grandpa. But when my sister started taking care of him, my mom would post about it on the family group chat, and everyone would appraise her and view her like a saint 

I feel like my mom was trying to change your image in the family because she did not have the best image due to her actions in the family . But it hurt to see her get that recognition, I’ve always wanted not necessarily just about my grandpa but in general. 

My sister said goodbye to him and left but I stayed back until they put my grandpa in a body bag . I wanted to make sure that he got there safely. I returned home and all my family were there and I went to my room and cried. I wanted a moment to just process everything. It hadn’t even been two minutes when my dad knocks on the door and was telling me to come outside. I told him I just needed a minute and he said no come out with the family. We were taking a shot.

For background, my family always takes a shot after someone passes as a celebratory of life kind of thing . But I don’t drink and I really just needed a moment. The whole weekend I didn’t get a single moment to myself to even process everything. I know my family greased by partying and spending time with each other, but everyone grieves differently and they did not respect that. I wanted some space. There’s other things that happened that weekend that my parents/sister did that really annoyed me and inconvenienced me.

I’ll just talk about one of the things that annoyed me . My Grandpa ‘s funeral is gonna be the next weekend which is this weekend now. And my dad was scheduling everyone’s flights and I finally got a one way flight. Which is huge for me because normally there’s never any one ways to where I’m going, and I always have to take some kind of connecting flight. However, without even asking me, my dad tried to cancel my plane ticket and give me a two-way.

The reasoning ? My sister’s boyfriend, technically not even her boyfriend they have this weird on and off relationship was coming to the funeral. And he’s never flown alone before. Keep in mind this man is like 28. They wanted me to take a connecting flight to their state before flying back to my state just so I can escort him to and from the airport. Which is a huge inconvenience for me. It would cause me to get home much later than anticipated on Sunday. So on Sundays, I really need enough time to get organized and get things set up since where I work it’s an hour away and I only get a 20 minute lunch so I need to meal prep prep on Sundays and I just have a lot to do on Sunday. The flight would allow me to at least have a decent amount of time to get all that done. A two-way flight would not.

My sister couldn’t fly back with him because my mom and her are going on a vacation together . My family often goes on vacations together and leaves me behind. Apparently, my sister had a meltdown and demanded that I fly with her BF to make things easier on him. I got to an argument with my dad saying that he didn’t even ask me and he said well that’s why we’re talking about it now but it’s not really talking about if he’s making the decision for me.

I had to argue 30 min to get a compromise. Which is now that I have to go to the airport at 5 AM escort him through TSA and I can’t use my per-check because he doesn’t have it and the airport we’re going to is really crowded so that’s gonna take a while to get through. Then I need to take him to his gate, chill with him at his gate for 2 hours and make sure he gets on the plane. Then find my gate and wait another 2-3 hours.

So I would be at the airport for roughly 5 hours before my flight . When it was my first time flying alone, no one gave a shit and told me to toughen enough and to figure it out. I also found out that my dad use my flight miles to buy her boyfriends ticket even though I’ve been saving them up. 

No, he did not ask again . it was just kind of expected of me to push back what I need to do to help out her boyfriend or anyone in the family for the Good of the family. This week has just been extremely hard. I didn’t even call out of work since I knew they needed me,  I work as a Paraprofessional Aid . And one of the kids this week was not taking his meds so he was pretty difficult with me this week. 

I’m just been going through the motions and trying to get through the week . I just miss my grandpa so much. Him and I were thick as thieves. Even though I didn’t come home as of often this last year, I still made a lot of time for him and to check up on him. It hurt me so much that my family never gave me any acknowledgment for my pain, but practically coddled my sister. She hasn’t worked in over 3 years and my parents pay for her house and any other expenses on top of her payment for her to be with my grandpa. I know for a fact, if money was not involved, she would not spend nearly as much time as she did with him. I’m just so tired of the favoritism I never being appreciated for the things I do for the family. 

I’ve always done what I was told always sacrificed what I wanted for the good of the family. I even went to the college. My parents wanted in the degree they wanted and graduated on the Dean’s list. But my mom told me that they lowered the bar for me so much and I still can’t reach it. Despite my sister dropping out college three times. It’s like they don’t even see me or my accomplishments. The only one  who did was my grandpa and now he’s gone. It feels weird, but I just have this feeling like I have no family left. And before anyone asked, I am in therapy. I just really wanted to get this out of my system, so thank you for anyone who stayed till the end.","I hate that my family only comforted my sister when my grandpa died I (24 F) have always been super close with my grandpa. he’s like a father figure to me and I always accidentally called him dad which he never minded.

Even though I didn’t come home as of often this last year, I still made a lot of time for him and to check up on him. It hurt me so much that my family never gave me any acknowledgment for my pain, but practically coddled my sister. She hasn’t worked in over 3 years and my parents pay for her house and any other expenses on top of her payment for her to be with my grandpa. I know for a fact, if money was not involved, she would not spend nearly as much time as she did with him. I’m just so tired of the favoritism I never being appreciated for the things I do for the family. 

I’ve always done what I was told always sacrificed what I wanted for the good of the family. I even went to the college. My parents wanted in the degree they wanted and graduated on the Dean’s list. But my mom told me that they lowered the bar for me so much and I still can’t reach it. Despite my sister dropping out college three times. It’s like they don’t even see me or my accomplishments. The only one  who did was my grandpa and now he’s gone. It feels weird, but I just have this feeling like I have no family left. And before anyone asked, I am in therapy. I just really wanted to get this out of my system, so thank you for anyone who stayed till the end.",2,2,2024-12-05 23:37,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1h7nb9h/i_hate_that_my_family_only_comforted_my_sister/,Neutral
18682,1h6ufc8,post,I am struggling with the aftermath of abuse in a new (healthy) relationship,"TLDR: I am 22 and my ex boyfriend of 5 years assaulted me. I am with my new boyfriend and he is so perfect and I feel guilty that what happened still affects me since this new guy now. Does it get easier to be loved gently? Do you ever stop feeling the grief of assault?

My ex and I never fought or argued but he fully assaulted me about 4 years in. I was half asleep and kept saying no and he simply did not listen or stop. This was 4 years into a seemingly relationship. And I tried to convince myself for a long time it was okay and I was overthinking it and for a few months I was able to. Right after he got upset and felt bad and I fucking REASSURED HIM IT WAS OKAY. I Don’t know why I did, it’s hard and I feel guilty for how I reacted as though it was okay at the time. Looking back now, it was always coercion. I remember feeling really pressured a lot but I never equated it to assault until I tried to push him off and said no and he didn't care. I broke up with him, and he admitted to raping me. 

Recently he reached out about being friends and I sent a rather rude message about how I am insulted he messaged me at all. I am angry. He admitted to assaulting me which means he knew it was wrong and I can no longer have the naive ""well he didn't realize..."" that stupidly made me feel better (I know it doesnt change anything but it made me feel less scared to think it wasn't malicious, I know its dumb). 

I have a new boyfriend now. He is fucking perfect. He took me on my first date EVER that I didn't plan for, drive to and pay for. He knows everything that happened and didn't make me feel worthless. (My ex knew I was assaulted when I was younger and was mad he didnt get my virginity, for context). But I feel so guilty because I have nightmares and get panicked and cry. My boyfriend makes me feel so safe and loved and I feel like I put him through so much because he has to take care of me when I am having panic attacks. The thing bothering me is I am over my ex but I still get really worked up about the assault.

I don't know how stop feeling guilty in my new relationship.  I feel awful that he has to pick up the pieces of something he didn't break. He doesn't make me feel bad, he is always there for me and supporting me and brings me ice cream and hugs me and makes me feel so safe and loved.

Covid annihilated my social life and absolutely messed up my youth. After an exchange year at uni I wanted to do another bachelors, didn’t like it and decided on a gap year. Didn’t take long for covid to hit and make these plans impossible. Had to sit my ass at home. Once I took up studying medicine again masks were everywhere, and it took way longer for them to be gone. Basically wasn’t able to speak to anyone without a mask during my mid-twenties, keeping up with friends I had was difficult as I was moving around the place for internships and they were too. I don’t even like the job



I’m now pushing 30, got basically no friends, my hobbies didn’t really develop. I have been in a relationship for like 6 or 7 years, my partner definitely loves me very much, but sex life is not great. Feel like I missed out on a ton of experiences. I was always a bit of a late bloomer, but developing my sexuality was definitely impaired by a family member having been raped a child and probably dragged me into some generational trauma kinda situation by telling me instead of a therapist. My family situation early in life was not really inspiring.



I feel like I really needed those years. Although I know 30 is probably younger than often thought and that in a lot of ways I was lucky with the cards I was dealt I just don’t know where to go from here. I just wanted to have a good time.

18686,1h4ia9n,post,Am I really not doing what’s best for myself?,"This will be a long post, and my first post on Reddit like this. Trigger warning: self harm, rape, eating disorder, miscarriage

To preface, 
From a very young age, I (24f now) was traumatized by my sibling (31m now) and my parents, and my first boyfriend I had when I was 13. 

I don’t want to go into too much detail because I don’t want to trauma dump but I do feel as if some details are necessary.  I was the youngest of five. Two of each. And me being the least problematic child, I was swept under the rug. My older brother, the now 31 year old, required the attention of my parents a lot more than us other kids. My fraternal sister  (30) is his full sibling. She attached to my fraternal grandmother. My other 2 siblings (31f and 28m now, maternal side) are full siblings as well but not to the other two. They’re step.  And they attached to their paternal grandparents. Then there was me, I attached to my maternal grandmother and maternal great uncle and his husband. 

We all had our person, but unfortunately we all have mommy AND daddy issues now. My parents weren’t *terrible*. Just a little much. We had a wooden paddle with holes drilled in it that my dad would beat us with. And we had a chore chart everyday after school. We weren’t allowed to eat things in the house except one snack per kid. I’m sure for financial reasons. Outside of this, I believe we had a decent childhood. My parents did their best to provide for us, but with five kids it was hard. My oldest brother (31) was sent to live with my fraternal. grandmother because of how extreme his behavior was. It got the best of their marriage, and they split after 12 years. Once split, my dad moved into his own place by himself, my sister (30) moved to live with her girlfriend, and my mom kept the house where her other two kids (31f) and (28m) lived with us and my sisters newborn.  Shortly after, my mom got diagnosed with cancer. She was doing chemo and radiation so she was radioactive and bed ridden. We weren’t allowed around her because we would’ve gotten sick. She lost her job, my sister who was 18 at the time was doing the household work while raising her child, and my brother 16 at the time was working full time (he did co op at school) to pay the bills. I was going back and forth between my parents house but mainly stayed at my dads because I didn’t want my mom to worry about me while I was there. During this time, I was dating a guy who was raping me. (I was 13, he was 15) I didn’t really know what sex was, outside of the act itself. I didn’t understand the consequences and the feelings that came with it. I was used. But I felt like I had to stay because I didn’t really have anyone else as my dad worked 12 hours a day and my mom was sick. Said boyfriend was also cheating, ghosting me for hours, and doing drugs. Fast forward, I would be at my dad’s and stuff at the house would disappear. Just small things here and there. Random things we didn’t use or whatever. I didn’t think anything of it. Until it was more and more everytime. He was also driving to a different bordering state to “redo my grandmothers bathroom”. But it became an every weekend thing. Then he sprung it on me that he was moving to be with his mom. He was happier back home. But I knew he had a girlfriend up there and that’s why. He told me two weeks before he moved. Then he was gone. I went from seeing him everyday to maybe once a month. While my mom was so sick she couldn’t move… I was left with no one. I don’t blame my mom at all. But I still struggled with not having a mother figure while I was going through such changes. I began self harming (13/14) 

Fast forward about a year and a half. I met a couple new friends from the county over. We immediately hit it off. It was a guy, and I kinda told him what was going on with said boyfriend and he told me straight up that I was getting taken advantage of. He convinced me to leave, but I knew I couldn’t do that knowing I would still have to see him at school. Around that time, mom found my cuts. And asked me what was going on. I didn’t tell her anything until about a month later. It was a Friday, I came home from school with all of my personal stuff from my locker and told mom she was enrolling me into the next county over where my friends and cousins were. She drove past it on her way to work so it was gonna work. She originally said no, but I eventually convinced her otherwise. She put me in therapy where I was put on anti depressants. 

At the new school, I found it hard to make friends. I closed off myself and was quiet and shy. I didn’t talk to anyone. I just did my work and went home. I observed who was who and what kind of people they were and eventually after my first year (15 now) , I made a friend. So I thought. We agreed to be each others valentine as a friend. I bought her candy she did the same for me. She asked if she could come over and hang out with me after school one day and I agreed. She came and within an hour she was trying to convince me to go to another girls house. I asked my mom, she was hesitant but ultimately let me go because I was trying to make new friends. Once we got there, i immediately realized it was a crack house. I try not to freak out. We go inside and hang for a bit. Then my friend disappears. She sneaks out and goes to her boyfriend’s house who lives a couple doors down. And then the other girl, her friend, was in the back room with her boyfriend getting high. The mom is slumped from drugs. And all that was left was me and a 19 year old drug dealer. Since I was by myself, I just went to sleep on the couch. Tried to anyway. Shortly after the guy came over to the couch and put his hand down my pants and started touching me. I was so scared but I couldn’t do anything. I cried myself to sleep.  The next morning I had her mom take me home. I immediately showered for awhile then called one of my guy friends girlfriends to come over. And she did. I told her what happened and she held me while I cried all day. 

Fast forward a year, I’m still struggling with my anxiety and self harm. I guess it was depression too. I stopped eating. And I decided it was my time. I couldn’t take it anymore. I tried to overdose on some pills but ultimately failed. I was inpatient at the local mental facility for a week where they pressured me and pressured me everyday until I told them what caused me to do what I did. That’s when cops were involved and blah blah blah. They told me I was lying basically after 2 years of investigating, talking to state troopers, child advocates, etc. I also found out the guy who assaulted me at my friends house has prior charges for touching a minor. 

We eventually moved to the next town over during that mess. But after about a year of living in our townhouse, my boyfriends at the time family  ended up buying three of the townhouses, one being the one I was l living in and he was moving into the other side. Mom said that’s not happening and we moved in with my aunt in a two bedroom house with 7 people. My mom met a guy at work, and started staying at his place and leaving me with my psychotic aunt. She blamed me for everything dirty and eating all the food when it was really her kids. My mom didn’t stick up for me. I was never home and started staying at my boyfriend’s house from the time I got out of school until my curfew. Then I went home, showered and went into my “room”( an area in the basement). And I repeated this for about a few months before mom finally let me live with her boyfriend. I started resenting her because she abandoned me again (this time intentionally) when I needed her the most. 

Fast forward some more. I’m graduated now, and I started dating a guy. And I wind up pregnant. (Unknowingly) I went on a beach trip with my dad, my now step mom, and one of my friends. While on the trip I felt weird. I had weird discharge, and my body was telling me something was wrong. But I ignored it. When I got home, I slept for days. I blamed it on the sun wearing me out. And I just needed to catch up on rest. But I decided to go to the hospital in the middle of the night because I thought I was pregnant. Turns out I was, and I was miscarrying. I told boyfriend. He told his whole family and they all convinced him I was lying. Even with paperwork from the hospital. And he ended up leaving. 

Shortly after, I came out to my mom and started dating a female. We dated for two years. We bought a house together (far away from my family). And then two months after, she broke up with me. I wasn’t surprised. But since I had abandonment issues I didn’t leave people even when I was unhappy. During the relationship, she cheated on me with her bestfriend. They would text 24/7, cuddle, she eventually started sleeping in bed with us. She gaslit me and just said they’re friends. This went on for over a year. 

Once she left, I took it so hard. I started going to therapy regularly. Once or twice a week. I met a new therapist, and I quickly learned so much about myself. I was diagnosed (get ready) with the following:
Basics- 
Anxiety, depression
Extreme: 
Borderline personality disorder, CPTSD, Bipolar, and ADHD. I also have some form of OCD. 

The hardest for me was the BPD. To be consider borderline, you have to meet 5/9 criteria. I met all 9 at the peak of my diagnosis. This was about 4 years ago as of current. During this four years, I have really really worked hard on myself. But I still feel hopeless. I still feel like I have no purpose, I still struggle with self harm, I can’t manage money. I don’t find anything in life pleasurable at all. I can name 5 times total in my life where I genuinely felt happy. I can’t keep a steady job, because I can’t work. It’s so hard for me to even get out of bed most days. But when I do go to work, it’s hard for me to stay. I get so anxious, I poop constantly, Throwing up, dry heaving, etc. 

However, I feel like even since I met my current wife, that I’ve gotten so much better mentally. I don’t struggle with eating anymore, my highs and lows aren’t nearly as bad, and I don’t get manic as often. Maybe once or twice every 6 months. 

But my sister (31) gave me a rude awakening a couple years ago. We took a sisters trip, and they decided to trip acid but I was DD. We spent the day at the strip, and then heads up the mountain on the skylift. It was a mini town up there. We got up there around 12, and we had a light show that night at 8 or 9pm. We walked around and did everything within two hours of getting up there. And that’s when my sisters were in full trip. They sat in a rocker on the side of the mountain and stared for literally 4 hours. I begged them to go back down the lift and explore then come back up but they said no. I was overpowered the whole trip as I feel like I didn’t enjoy any of it because of my mental health. We finally get back to the cabin, and get in the hottub. That’s when my sister (31) saw my self harm cuts. And went off. She told me I needed to get my head out of my ass and that I didn’t do anything to better myself and I don’t care about my well being. And my wife isn’t helping me and she thinks I should leave her and what not. I took it really hard. She was super rude about it and I feel as if she would’ve approached it different, I wouldn’t have been as upset. But I got out and went inside and cried myself to sleep. The next morning, we left and went home. Since then, I haven’t been as close to my sister. I don’t call or text much anymore unless it has to do with her kids. And it completely changed the dynamic of our relationship. 

Here recently, I started letting her back in kinda. But In a different way than before. And she hasn’t said anything until we had thanksgiving. She mentioned in front of the whole family that again, I had no ambition or want to help myself or get better. And yet again, I’m sad and trying to figure out what I can do. Am I really doing it to myself? I’ve done all the steps, I’ve taken meds, I’ve done constant therapy, DBT, inpatient, anything you can think of. And nothing helps. I still have no want in life or purpose. Nothing is fun. I don’t enjoy living. And I’m overall a waste of a human I feel. 

I do think I am a great person. I am compassionate, kind, giving, empathetic, and I feel very extremely. I would do anything for anyone. Maybe that’s my purpose. But that isn’t enough for me. It doesn’t pay the bills. It doesn’t motivate me. I can preach all day to others on how to get better but I can’t do it myself. 

I feel like a burden on my wife. Everyday is a struggle. She makes good money but she can’t pay for everything you know? I just feel like I’m too much. Between the spending, the cutting, my mental health. Can someone give me a reality check? Nicely please?? What can I do? How can I be better? Anything helps.

Shortly after, my mom got diagnosed with cancer. She was doing chemo and radiation so she was radioactive and bed ridden. We weren’t allowed around her because we would’ve gotten sick. She lost her job, my sister who was 18 at the time was doing the household work while raising her child, and my brother 16 at the time was working full time (he did co op at school) to pay the bills. I was going back and forth between my parents house but mainly stayed at my dads because I didn’t want my mom to worry about me while I was there. During this time, I was dating a guy who was raping me. (I was 13, he was 15) I didn’t really know what sex was, outside of the act itself. I didn’t understand the consequences and the feelings that came with it. I was used. But I felt like I had to stay because I didn’t really have anyone else as my dad worked 12 hours a day and my mom was sick. Said boyfriend was also cheating, ghosting me for hours, and doing drugs. Fast forward, I would be at my dad’s and stuff at the house would disappear. Just small things here and there. Random things we didn’t use or whatever. I didn’t think anything of it. Until it was more and more everytime. He was also driving to a different bordering state to “redo my grandmothers bathroom”. But it became an every weekend thing. Then he sprung it on me that he was moving to be with his mom. He was happier back home. But I knew he had a girlfriend up there and that’s why. He told me two weeks before he moved. Then he was gone. I went from seeing him everyday to maybe once a month. While my mom was so sick she couldn’t move… I was left with no one. I don’t blame my mom at all. But I still struggled with not having a mother figure while I was going through such changes. I began self harming (13/14) 

Fast forward about a year and a half. I met a couple new friends from the county over. We immediately hit it off. It was a guy, and I kinda told him what was going on with said boyfriend and he told me straight up that I was getting taken advantage of. He convinced me to leave, but I knew I couldn’t do that knowing I would still have to see him at school. Around that time, mom found my cuts. And asked me what was going on. I didn’t tell her anything until about a month later. It was a Friday, I came home from school with all of my personal stuff from my locker and told mom she was enrolling me into the next county over where my friends and cousins were. She drove past it on her way to work so it was gonna work. She originally said no, but I eventually convinced her otherwise. She put me in therapy where I was put on anti depressants. 

At the new school, I found it hard to make friends. I closed off myself and was quiet and shy. I didn’t talk to anyone. I just did my work and went home. I observed who was who and what kind of people they were and eventually after my first year (15 now) , I made a friend. So I thought. We agreed to be each others valentine as a friend. I bought her candy she did the same for me. She asked if she could come over and hang out with me after school one day and I agreed. She came and within an hour she was trying to convince me to go to another girls house. I asked my mom, she was hesitant but ultimately let me go because I was trying to make new friends. Once we got there, i immediately realized it was a crack house. I try not to freak out. We go inside and hang for a bit. Then my friend disappears. She sneaks out and goes to her boyfriend’s house who lives a couple doors down. And then the other girl, her friend, was in the back room with her boyfriend getting high. The mom is slumped from drugs. And all that was left was me and a 19 year old drug dealer. Since I was by myself, I just went to sleep on the couch. Tried to anyway. Shortly after the guy came over to the couch and put his hand down my pants and started touching me. I was so scared but I couldn’t do anything. I cried myself to sleep.  The next morning I had her mom take me home. I immediately showered for awhile then called one of my guy friends girlfriends to come over. And she did. I told her what happened and she held me while I cried all day. 

Fast forward a year, I’m still struggling with my anxiety and self harm. I guess it was depression too. I stopped eating. And I decided it was my time. I couldn’t take it anymore. I tried to overdose on some pills but ultimately failed. I was inpatient at the local mental facility for a week where they pressured me and pressured me everyday until I told them what caused me to do what I did. That’s when cops were involved and blah blah blah. They told me I was lying basically after 2 years of investigating, talking to state troopers, child advocates, etc. I also found out the guy who assaulted me at my friends house has prior charges for touching a minor. 

We eventually moved to the next town over during that mess. But after about a year of living in our townhouse, my boyfriends at the time family  ended up buying three of the townhouses, one being the one I was l living in and he was moving into the other side. Mom said that’s not happening and we moved in with my aunt in a two bedroom house with 7 people. My mom met a guy at work, and started staying at his place and leaving me with my psychotic aunt. She blamed me for everything dirty and eating all the food when it was really her kids. My mom didn’t stick up for me. I was never home and started staying at my boyfriend’s house from the time I got out of school until my curfew. Then I went home, showered and went into my “room”( an area in the basement). And I repeated this for about a few months before mom finally let me live with her boyfriend. I started resenting her because she abandoned me again (this time intentionally) when I needed her the most. 

Fast forward some more. I’m graduated now, and I started dating a guy. And I wind up pregnant. (Unknowingly) I went on a beach trip with my dad, my now step mom, and one of my friends. While on the trip I felt weird. I had weird discharge, and my body was telling me something was wrong. But I ignored it. When I got home, I slept for days. I blamed it on the sun wearing me out. And I just needed to catch up on rest. But I decided to go to the hospital in the middle of the night because I thought I was pregnant. Turns out I was, and I was miscarrying. I told boyfriend. He told his whole family and they all convinced him I was lying. Even with paperwork from the hospital. And he ended up leaving. 

Shortly after, I came out to my mom and started dating a female. We dated for two years. We bought a house together (far away from my family). And then two months after, she broke up with me. I wasn’t surprised. But since I had abandonment issues I didn’t leave people even when I was unhappy. During the relationship, she cheated on me with her bestfriend. They would text 24/7, cuddle, she eventually started sleeping in bed with us. She gaslit me and just said they’re friends. This went on for over a year. 

Once she left, I took it so hard. I started going to therapy regularly. Once or twice a week. I met a new therapist, and I quickly learned so much about myself. I was diagnosed (get ready) with the following:
Basics- 
Anxiety, depression
Extreme: 
Borderline personality disorder, CPTSD, Bipolar, and ADHD. I also have some form of OCD. 

The hardest for me was the BPD. To be consider borderline, you have to meet 5/9 criteria. I met all 9 at the peak of my diagnosis. This was about 4 years ago as of current. During this four years, I have really really worked hard on myself. But I still feel hopeless. I still feel like I have no purpose, I still struggle with self harm, I can’t manage money. I don’t find anything in life pleasurable at all. I can name 5 times total in my life where I genuinely felt happy. I can’t keep a steady job, because I can’t work. It’s so hard for me to even get out of bed most days. But when I do go to work, it’s hard for me to stay. I get so anxious, I poop constantly, Throwing up, dry heaving, etc. 

However, I feel like even since I met my current wife, that I’ve gotten so much better mentally. I don’t struggle with eating anymore, my highs and lows aren’t nearly as bad, and I don’t get manic as often. Maybe once or twice every 6 months. 

But my sister (31) gave me a rude awakening a couple years ago. We took a sisters trip, and they decided to trip acid but I was DD. We spent the day at the strip, and then heads up the mountain on the skylift. It was a mini town up there. We got up there around 12, and we had a light show that night at 8 or 9pm. We walked around and did everything within two hours of getting up there. And that’s when my sisters were in full trip. They sat in a rocker on the side of the mountain and stared for literally 4 hours. I begged them to go back down the lift and explore then come back up but they said no. I was overpowered the whole trip as I feel like I didn’t enjoy any of it because of my mental health. We finally get back to the cabin, and get in the hottub. That’s when my sister (31) saw my self harm cuts. And went off. She told me I needed to get my head out of my ass and that I didn’t do anything to better myself and I don’t care about my well being. And my wife isn’t helping me and she thinks I should leave her and what not. I took it really hard. She was super rude about it and I feel as if she would’ve approached it different, I wouldn’t have been as upset. But I got out and went inside and cried myself to sleep. The next morning, we left and went home. Since then, I haven’t been as close to my sister. I don’t call or text much anymore unless it has to do with her kids. And it completely changed the dynamic of our relationship. 

Here recently, I started letting her back in kinda. But In a different way than before. And she hasn’t said anything until we had thanksgiving. She mentioned in front of the whole family that again, I had no ambition or want to help myself or get better. And yet again, I’m sad and trying to figure out what I can do. Am I really doing it to myself? I’ve done all the steps, I’ve taken meds, I’ve done constant therapy, DBT, inpatient, anything you can think of. And nothing helps. I still have no want in life or purpose. Nothing is fun. I don’t enjoy living. And I’m overall a waste of a human I feel. 

I do think I am a great person. I am compassionate, kind, giving, empathetic, and I feel very extremely. I would do anything for anyone. Maybe that’s my purpose. But that isn’t enough for me. It doesn’t pay the bills. It doesn’t motivate me. I can preach all day to others on how to get better but I can’t do it myself. 

I feel like a burden on my wife. Everyday is a struggle. She makes good money but she can’t pay for everything you know? I just feel like I’m too much. Between the spending, the cutting, my mental health. Can someone give me a reality check? Nicely please?? What can I do? How can I be better? Anything helps.

18687,1h4hdwt,post,Needed to Get my Life Off my Chest as I’m Filled With Rage and Hopelessness ,"TW - Cancer, DV, Rape, Suicide

THE BEGINNING OF THE END

My childhood was filled with love, friends, family and life. I was popular in primary school especially year 6 when I faked confidence to climb the childish hierarchy at school.

2009 age 11 I won the Australian Judo national championships unaware that I had cancer at the time.

I was incredibly fit yet as later that year I wasn’t able to complete on lap around a oval. Frustrated and angry at myself everyday I would workout after school confused on why despite my efforts I was fatigue and weak. Random bruises began appearing all over my body to the point my mum thought I was being beaten up at school which was far from the truth.

We suspected some form anaemia. Maybe I just have an iron deficiency. Little did we know the results were catastrophic.

The doctor told me I shouldn’t of been able to lift my head from a pillow little yet be capable of doing judo flips.

GOODBYE HOME

I had to travel 5 hours away from home to get my diagnosis of cancer as my hometown didn’t have the facilities needed for my treatment.

People don’t realise it’s not just the cancer that scares and haunts you. It’s the wailing of dying child Rena’s you stumble to the bathroom. The chemo side effects and looking in the mirror only to be unrecognisable.

I will go into detail later in a future post but for now at 25. Hallways will forever haunt me.

I finally get to visit home after a few months and see my friends. Something I was so excited for only to get bullied for my looks due to chemo. I was at the break of death and now I’m alone and those words would set off an eating disorder that I fought for years to come.

My best friend at the time said ‘you never had a bad word to say about anyone but after that moment you’re now filled with hate’. It’s true I was a goody two shoes child, little did I know I would turn into a psychopathic monster.

I was cured at 14. The doctors happily announced the news to me and I couldn’t even smile. I wished it killed me. Bipolar, PTSD everything in my life was dull. My dreams felt more real that waking up up was my actual nightmare.

FAST FORWARD TO 18

I did it. I got my life on track after working so hard in therapy I’m now thriving only to have my cancer return. Not only that later being raped in remission.

I leave the later parts in my story quick as it’s exhausting to type this but I plan to continue when I can. I ended up in relationships that took two to tango but some that will haunt me forever too.

PRESENT

My soul sister and best friend since year 2 (Almost 20 years of friendships) my absolute all killed herself last year and now I’ve got endometriosis that lead to surgery where I’m now infertile. That surgery didn’t work so i had ketamine infusions. And now something is wrong with my thyroid.

WILL IT EVER END?

The majority of my life has been hell now. And I’m lost. I’ve tried CBT, DBT, TMS, ECT. I’ve always tried.

By July I will hopefully be prescribed magic mushroom pills. I’m not sure how it works. If it’s a pill or a controlled environment but from studies it looks incredibly successful.

18688,1h44yts,post,Why Do They in the West Ignore the Oppression They Left Behind?,"Let’s talk about the elephant in the room: the absolute silence (or worse, justification) from Muslims in the West about the atrocities happening in the Middle East. Women forced into marriages, beaten for showing a strand of hair, raped with no legal recourse because ‘marital rape isn’t a thing,’ LGBTQ+ individuals publicly executed, and journalists silenced for daring to speak up. This isn’t cultural trauma—it’s systemic, institutionalized oppression rooted in laws justified by religious interpretations.

And yet, the moment someone in the West tries to critique these systems, we’re met with cries of 'Islamophobia' or 'You don’t understand, that’s not the real Islam.' Well, which Islam is it then? Because the one we see practiced in Iran, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Jordan, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, and elsewhere is devastating lives every single day. Why are Western Muslims, who enjoy the freedoms and rights they’d be denied back home, the loudest defenders of the very regimes and ideologies they fled?

I get it: diversity, acceptance, tolerance. But tolerance without accountability? Empathy without action? That just makes you an enabler. If Islam is truly a 'religion of peace,' why is it that every time we discuss the Middle East, the conversation circles back to human rights violations? If you can protest injustice here in the West, why are you silent when it’s happening in the name of your faith elsewhere?

18689,1h3yy27,post,Dog Owners I am associated with are extremely irresponsible. Feeling Angry and repulsed.,"TW: Animal Neglect and Abuse

Disclaimer: I love dogs, I grew up with dogs in a happy safe environment . I used to be so happy when I saw dogs. But now from recent experiences, I can no longer feel at ease when I see dogs. I have begun to be repulsed by my neglectful roommate and old friend.

  
First: My roommate is a professional dog patroller and owns two (2) dogs that are lucky to come out of his dark and dirty room for more than an hour a day. For 19 to 22 hours a day, the dogs are stuck behind the bedroom door with less than 6 feet to walk on trash or laundry . He has called me names in the past and raised his voice when confronted about his abusive behavior. Roommate tells me I need to stop ""humanizing"" his dogs. 

 I am tempted to report my roommate to the humane society since the non-emergency police number recommended it, but I am afraid of physical retaliation from my unstable roommate and/or having to pay full rent. 

Today, the 2 dogs were let out today at 12:45 pm for 20 minutes then 11:35 pm for about 10 minutes. This has happened for the past year and a half. Roommate stays in room at all chances.

Yesterday, when I let the retired dog ""Nile"" out of the room after day 3 of whining behind the door while roommate at work, Nile frantically drank water as if he hadn't drank for a full day. Almost 4 minutes straight.I don't want to violate roommate's privacy but animal welfare is important to me.

I opened the door to see laundry and trash on his floor, the only place where Nile is able to walk. 

The last week I let Nile out for the same reason, Nile pooped on the floor in the house even after being let out to the backyard before roommate left. 

 The other dog is crated until he goes to work, but he vomits from anxiety almost daily and is ribcage skinny. Only time patrol dog is allowed out of crate is when he has to vomit. Carpet is stained by his crate with vomit.

Roommate had a third dog when he first moved in, but she was taken away because Roommate claimed she was ""untrainable"" meanwhile he commanded her to stay in one place while he played videogames or watched TV. If she moved , he would get very angry at her. 

Roommate takes absolutely no responsibility.

He is repulsive to me. I hate feeling hatred towards anybody, but truthfully he is who I hate the most for his dog abuse.

  
Second: My old friend left his 2 small dogs, French bulldog and mini pug in a big kennel while he left to take his Mom to the hospital. 

When he returned home, the miniature pug was seemingly raped or crushed to death by his French Bulldog. His French bulldog suffers from extreme separation anxiety and decided to attack the other dog while left alone. 

I found this out after I asked my old friend why he had only been posting videos of his bulldog, what happened to the pug, and then he explained the story to me, saying the other dog didn't mean to.

I have never been fond of his Frenchie since he had no manners trained into him, but now I do not want to see it ever again. I don't know how to tell my old friend this.

Unfortunate neglectful events related to pet dogs have been in my reality too frequently and for too long. it is what I hate to be a witness to the most.

Please give me advice. 

I am saving up and trying to move out by next year.","Dog Owners I am associated with are extremely irresponsible. Feeling Angry and repulsed. TW: Animal Neglect and Abuse

18692,1h2u6an,post,I broke up with my ex girlfriend and I’m dating her best friend. Now most of my friends hate me. ,"I broke up with my girlfriend and I’m dating her best friend, and now most of my friends hate me. 

Please read this whole thing. I know how long it is but I feel like I’m going crazy and I need people to understand why. 

TL;DR: My (16M) ex (16F) made my sophomore year of high school a living hell, so I dumped her and caught feelings for her “best friend” a couple weeks later. We’re now dating.

It all starts at the beginning of my sophomore year of high school, I caught Mono and Covid either at the same time or in rapid succession (doctors are unsure) in early September of last year, leaving me incredibly fatigued and with brain fog through the roof. As a result, if I didn’t get amazing sleep, I would feel like shit the next day and not be able to get anything done. 

At the same time, for unrelated reasons, my girlfriend’s mental health started to deteriorate. I tried really hard to support her and take care of her, but that’s a lot of responsibility to put on a teenager. I begged her to talk to the guidance counselors or to ask her parents for therapy, call a hotline, or even to just talk to one of her (MANY!!) close friends, but she refused to. She told me I was the only one she felt comfortable talking to. 

Side note, but throughout our relationship I constantly felt manipulated but never quite to the point where I could call it out or confront her. Examples: whenever I told her I was too tired to do something like activities or dates, she would tell me it would have made her reeallllyy happyyy if we had done it; whenever I needed to go to sleep and leave the call, she would either start crying or beg for more time; whenever I went to hangout at social gatherings that we were both invited to but she couldn’t make it to (she would always cancel whenever it was the reverse), she would say something like “I’m so glad you had fun without me!” Insidious shit like that. I still don’t know if I’m crazy or not for thinking all of that was manipulative. 

Over the course of the school year I started to feel more and more like her therapist, I was constantly exhausted, I never recovered from long covid or residual mono during our relationship because of my constant lack of sleep, and I even started MY OWN therapy because I was so anxious and overwhelmed. 

And then one weekend in Feb. we both got invited to sleepover. She didn’t have a ride there but I did. She had warned me earlier in the week that it was gonna be a rough weekend for her because her sister — who was really hard on her and mean to her — was coming home from college. 

so anyway i told her i was gonna go to the sleepover but that she could call if she needed me and i would try to be there for her. there was only one part of the sleepover where i didn’t have my phone on me and when i realized i made us turn around (we were on a walk) just so i could go grab it. later that night she texts me, telling me she tried to kill herself and that she had called me and i wasn’t there for her when she needed me to be. to this day i genuinely don’t know what happened and how i missed her call but i immediately left the room we were hanging out in and spent the rest of the night practically talking her off of the ledge. 

After coming home to my parents and telling them — then facing the barrage of “how could you’s” from my girlfriend for telling my parents, who then reached out to her parents just to ensure they knew what happened and could handle things accordingly — our relationship went back to its terrible normal.

However, the last straw was when she nonchalantly mentioned to me that her parents told her she could “say the word,” and they would get her into therapy. Until now her biggest reason for not getting help had been her fear that her traditional parents would lash out about mental health-related issues. From then on I was pretty checked out on our relationship, and I broke up with her shortly after in early spring. 

I think that honestly her mask slipped in the days after breaking up with her. I want to take a minute to acknowledge that breakups SUCK and lead people to do crazy things, and I think even a lot of her behavior in general could be excused (or at least explained) because of her mental health. Anyway, she texted me constantly in the days following our breakup, at first she begged for another chance and gave me shit for not trying to “talk about all these things” first (it was all we talked about towards the end of our relationship and I made it very clear that her refusal to get help was harming both me and our relationship). She called me at 6 in the morning one day over the weekend and begged for my company, she would not stop hinting about how she was thinking about trying to kill herself again (guilt tripping?????), and she REFUSED to talk to any of her friends about any of this even tho I begged her to. I even reached out to her friends in a private group chat and asked them to tell her they were there if she needed anything after breaking up with her. 

Things started to settle down after a few weeks, and I started to recover both mentally and FINALLY physically. I cleaned up, got a haircut, all the “good” post break up recovery stuff. I also started to spend more time with my mates again, and about two weeks later I started to have feelings for one of my closer friends. She also was a close friend of my ex’s. For reference, my relationship with Ex was almost exactly 1.5 years long. I know. I don’t feel great about it either. I think part of it was just getting to have fun again with a girl and not feel this absurd existential dread just from being around her. Me and New Girl happened to be at a lot of social events together during this time period and I ended up texting her and even complementing her looks and stuff like that as well. Ex somehow picked up on all of this pretty quickly, and I sincerely think that part of it was just her getting jealous seeing me being friends and having fun with another girl and getting kind of lucky with her guess, IDK if that makes any sense. 

Ex essentially guilt tripped New Girl into telling her what was going on, Ex even said that she would no longer be friends with New Girl if New Girl didn’t show Ex all of New Girl’s messages with me immediately. Later that day she demanded New Girl either tell me she wasn’t interested in a relationship over text and send screenshots to Ex, or Ex would stop being friends with New Girl.

The next day me and my friends who trusted me and were loyal to me and who had some idea of what was going on noticed and overheard Ex talking to anyone and everyone about me and New Girl. To this day I’m not sure what she said so I can’t make any accusations, but I think not knowing is somehow worse. By the end of the school day a good handful of my friends (New Girl’s best friends) were ignoring me and walking right past me without making eye contact. I also had good reason to believe that Ex was reaching out privately over text to many of my friends and telling them things (same deal, I don’t know what). I ended up sending out a long paragraph on a medium-sized group chat with all of my friends (including Ex and New Girl) who either heard something from Ex, heard some thing from me, or knew something was going on from close proximity. The contents were essentially an apology for all of that chaos I caused, explaining that I had feelings for New Girl and that was why Ex was upset, and asking if we could talk things out on the group chat for everyone to see so that hopefully everyone could be on the same page. I guess I wanted to just put all of the cards on the table and try and be transparent and own up to the fact that I messed up. 

But I never let on how terrible Ex had treated me or why I broke up with her, so from an outsider perspective I looked like a terrible dude. The group text went about as well as you please. Anyway, fast forward, and now things just feel kind of weird. It’s been half a year since things went down and many of my old friends won’t even talk to me or look me in the eyes. Many of them spread rumors about me cheating on Ex. Even my friends who still talk to me are just kind of cold and it doesn’t really feel right anymore. I don’t even feel guilty for what I did after all of the hurt that Ex put me through. I’m just mad at myself for not putting her on blast for the way she treated me. 

Did I mention that she made me feel sexually uncomfortable? She would beg for sexual activity when I was too tired or not in a location I was comfortable with, even moving my hands without my consent onto different parts of her body. I know it’s not rape or even harassment really but I feel so taken advantage of. I haven’t told anyone about that part except my current girlfriend, so naturally i’m plastering it on the internet for the whole world to see. 

I’m not sure what to do now. I’m super happy with New Girl but I have this unrelenting anger and sadness about the whole situation that I don’t know how to cope with. That’s all. ","I broke up with my ex girlfriend and I’m dating her best friend. Now most of my friends hate me.  I broke up with my girlfriend and I’m dating her best friend, and now most of my friends hate me. 

Please read this whole thing. I know how long it is but I feel like I’m going crazy and I need people to understand why. 

TL;DR: My (16M) ex (16F) made my sophomore year of high school a living hell, so I dumped her and caught feelings for her “best friend” a couple weeks later. We’re now dating.

It all starts at the beginning of my sophomore year of high school, I caught Mono and Covid either at the same time or in rapid succession (doctors are unsure) in early September of last year, leaving me incredibly fatigued and with brain fog through the roof. As a result, if I didn’t get amazing sleep, I would feel like shit the next day and not be able to get anything done. 

At the same time, for unrelated reasons, my girlfriend’s mental health started to deteriorate. I tried really hard to support her and take care of her, but that’s a lot of responsibility to put on a teenager. I begged her to talk to the guidance counselors or to ask her parents for therapy, call a hotline, or even to just talk to one of her (MANY!!) close friends, but she refused to. She told me I was the only one she felt comfortable talking to. 

Side note, but throughout our relationship I constantly felt manipulated but never quite to the point where I could call it out or confront her. Examples: whenever I told her I was too tired to do something like activities or dates, she would tell me it would have made her reeallllyy happyyy if we had done it; whenever I needed to go to sleep and leave the call, she would either start crying or beg for more time; whenever I went to hangout at social gatherings that we were both invited to but she couldn’t make it to (she would always cancel whenever it was the reverse), she would say something like “I’m so glad you had fun without me!” Insidious shit like that. I still don’t know if I’m crazy or not for thinking all of that was manipulative.

18693,1h2ly7r,post,I feel like killing myself all the time ,"Everything is fucked up. Nothing ever gets better. I'm tired of the pain and the hurt. I don't know why I haven't killed myself till now. I'm also seeing a counselor on a biweekly basis. I've not been on talking terms with my family since almost a year as I was extremely depressed and suicidal living with them. I just got a text from my sister that my dog, who is about 10.5 is extremely unwell and mayn't make it till next year. I always knew this day will come. I have been thinking about this since  we had him. He was my only companion as a child. He had a pretty rough life tho and was extremely aggressive, had a biting history, including biting me multiple times. I used to walk him when I was back in my country. Eventually, everything was too overwhelming for me living at home. I just wanted to run away and the pain to go away. To just not feel hurt anymore. So I left that shit hole. That also meant leaving behind a 10 year old senior dog. That was the most difficult decision of my life. After that I ignored most of the messages from my family for 3-4 months. Until I started responding to them like once a month on text. Now I reply once a week. Though I haven't talked with anyone in an year. I struggle with communicating to the point of bottling all of my feelings up.  And my only elaborate text was when I was leaving explaining how bad everything was. Apart from that, my only reply is I'm fine whenever they try to check in on me. I just wish I wasn't born. I did not even choose to be born. I was born in a house , body, and mind in which I didn't want to be. Yesterday after my session with the counselor,  I was a little happy as she scheduled me an appointment with a doctor. But I knew I don't deserve to  be happy. Now I have received this news. It's not shocking since I always knew this day would come. He was unwell when I had left as well and I was surprised he was even alive after that since he has a biting history and I didn't expect for anyone at home to be able to provide for him for such a long time. I just don't know how to even numb the pain. There's no escape. I'm not looking for any sympathy as I know none of this gets better. There are brief glimpses of sunlight in this journey through a tunnel that deludes people into thinking like there's any hope. It doesn't fool me tho. That's a reason I'm chronically miserable. As I know it doesn't fucking get better. I wish there was someone that could just take all of it away. But I know there's nobody. We come alone, we struggle alone, and die alone. There maybe times you're not alone but everything is conditional and nothing lasts forever. Eventually this all won't matter. Everyone and everything is gonna disintegrate and turn to ash again. But that doesn't change how I currently feel. All I think about everyday is how much this hellhole sucks and how this world is full of unimaginable suffering for all sentient beings. My dog's gonna suffer and die, everyone I love/ ever loved is gonna suffer and die. I just don't get how anyone can think of perpetuating this meaningless existence by adding more sentient beings to the mix. I just wish someone can shoot me silently without any warning so that all of this goes away since I'm too big of a coward to actually do it myself. Running away from your problems doesn't make them go away. Facing them just brings more anguish. There's just nowhere to go to hide. I sometimes wonder if it's better that there's no meaning to it all. I just hope reincarnation isn't real. It just can't be. There can be no reason 6 year olds are being raped and murdered or how innocent animals are being subjected to unimaginable suffering in the wild or in factory farms. I don't even think there's a point in going back. My going back isn't gonna help anyone. My dog's still gonna die. I'm just gonna retraumatise myself with everything by being with them. Sometimes I wish I had blocked everyone and killed myself. That would have made it better. I don't even know how to cope or feel better. Probably because there's no way. I just want to be as far away from that shit hole as possible. Now she has deleted all the messages. Too bad I have read them this time. Other times she has deleted them before I could read them. I'm just at a loss of what to do.","I feel like killing myself all the time  Everything is fucked up. Nothing ever gets better. I'm tired of the pain and the hurt.

18696,1h0o61a,post,I hate that rape has become political ,"I'm not going to name any names, but as a survivor I've been pretty upset about the reaction that people have had to the recent allegations against this man. 

Everything they've been saying about the alleged victim feels like an attack: She went to his hotel room willingly. She was flirting with him. She didn't look intoxicated. She waited too long to go to the police. She waited too long to go to the hospital. She was cheating on her husband and ""cried rape"" to cover it up. She had sex with him willingly and accused him of rape to assuage her guilt. She was trying to extort him for money.

Oh and that rich or good looking guys don't need to rape women. No shit. Nobody ""needs"" to rape women. They do it because they want to.

This is why victims don't go to the police. It's happened to me a few times and I've only reported it once. Because I know how people are. I know how the system works. A lot of those things that people are saying about the victim could apply to me. If they think she's lying for those reasons then they must think I'm lying too. 

It makes no sense that someone would falsely accuse someone because they regretted having sex with them or because they cheated and felt guilty. When I reported my assault it was a very traumatic experience. Police came to my home.They interviewed me,interviewed him and interviewed witnesses. They took my clothes. I had to go to the hospital and be examined. How could that possibly be better than feeling guilty about cheating?

It shouldn't matter whether the accused is on ""your side"" or ""their side."" It also shouldn't matter if it's a celebrity that you like. Likeable, charming people rape. Attractive people rape. Rich people rape. 

Now yeah there have been some allegations and rumors that seem to be political in nature. But that shouldn't be an excuse to say that any allegation against someone who holds office is politically motivated or false. If the story seems credible, it should be taken seriously. And by ""seems credible"" I don't mean that  people should try to do everything they can to cast doubt on the victim's story.

I think it's just an excuse for people to let their inner misogyny out. They claim it's because the other side is trying to ruin their guy's good name, but that's just how they feel about women. And that's really disappointing to know that many people, including women, feel that way about us.

18697,m5ulgn6,comment,,"When my son was younger, I didn’t have a car and used to travel everywhere on public transportation. Some guy would talk to us, focusing most of the talk on my then two-year-old son. And then one day, he walked past and made a point to say “hi (my son’s name).”

Innocuous enough, right? But like you, one day I looked up sex offenders in the area because my son was so incredibly small at age 2, like any child his age. I saw the weird dude on the sex offenders list and for crimes that happened before a certain year, they were not allowed to list if it was a child sex crime or a sex crime of an adult victim. At least, that is how it was in my state. Thankfully they changed it - but not very long ago, especially at the time this incident happened. My thoughts were, “but people convicted after X year would most likely still be in jail or prison!”

I looked up his old cases on the publicly accessible docket sheets. I found out from there what he did. Multiple cases of child sex offenses. Multiple victims. 

And then one day I heard someone continually calling my son’s name in a large department store. At first, I thought it was my imagination because it was so intentionally low and sing-songy.

I looked over, and it was the aforementioned convicted sex offender. What is most creepy is he was using a ride on shopping cart; the type made for those with physical disabilities. But he walked just fine; at least he did the last time we saw him, several weeks prior.

My theory and gut was that he planned to distract my kid away from me and then rush off in the electric shopping cart with him. Fortunately, his plan failed. Even after I brushed him off to get away from him, he followed us in a parallel fashion in the aisles across the walkway.

I rushed my child away from him and the store, and by this time, I did have a car. I looked him up on Megan’s Law again before calling the police, so that I could give them accurate address information. He was now listed as having “absconded.” This was a change from the few weeks prior when I first saw him on the website.

So, yes, though I am a free range parent; that is only to a point. There’s no Megan’s Law list for patrons of department stores, either."," When my son was younger, I didn’t have a car and used to travel everywhere on public transportation. Some guy would talk to us, focusing most of the talk on my then two-year-old son. And then one day, he walked past and made a point to say “hi (my son’s name).”

Innocuous enough, right? But like you, one day I looked up sex offenders in the area because my son was so incredibly small at age 2, like any child his age. I saw the weird dude on the sex offenders list and for crimes that happened before a certain year, they were not allowed to list if it was a child sex crime or a sex crime of an adult victim. At least, that is how it was in my state. Thankfully they changed it - but not very long ago, especially at the time this incident happened.

You know what you want and it's terrible this keeps happening to you, (and there are *so many stories* of this happening to other women, including women I know!) The suggestion to be upfront that you're recording the conversation is a good one, both for legal reasons depending on your jurisdiction, and because it could likely prevent the over cutting in the first place.

I hope you find a stylist somewhere you visit often who does your hair exactly as you request. ❤️  

My mom made me get my butt length hair cut in 4th grade. It was a stylish (at the time; I'm an old) 😉 pixie cut, but, as a result, my hair, which was about to go through its adolescent puberty ""get curlier and curlier"" phase, spent years looking like complete shit!! Not until 11th grade did I finally like my hair again, due to it becoming long enough for my liking, and because I found Luz, the most awesome stylist I've had before or since."," If my hair were so dry at the ends that it looked ""dead"", I'd probably go by the stylist's recommended cut, but, that's just me. (My curly hair tends to get knots in it. I don't use any heat on it, but just by virtue of texture alone, the last couple or few inches are often like straw if I don't use extra conditioner, extra mousse, and slather a handful of lotion through it.)

I've been trying to make mine understand for a while that I want to change my style, I've taken in photos, talked about change etc.  All she wants to do is  is the generic blow dry & then add waves with a set of GHDs.  Her demeanour just changes every time I say I don't want that.  I've had it for 5 years, it's time for a change

The last time I asked for ""bangs"" to start at my cheek bone area, shorter layers through out & a bouncy blow dry. I showed pictures, talked about it during the cut & I came out with a fringe that starts at my chin, a haircut that looks like a pudding basin has been put on my head & cut around and a blow dry that had as much bounce as Snape from Harry Potter.  I was so upset I just wanted to get out of there asap.  I immediately booked an appointment with another hairdresser.  Who gave me exactly what I asked for.  

I'm now going back to the new one for a colour.  Here's hoping she continues to listen to what her client says.  I'm open to change if she can explain why what I ask for doesn't suit me or can suggest something similar but better.  But I'm not open to paying for a service where I don't receive what I've asked for"," Hairdressers not listening doesn't only happen to people with long hair.

18749,m84yvcb,comment,,My mum cuts my hair cause I have issues with haircuts that I won't go into. I only ever want a small cut but she shows me the bits that look dead are over what I want and I go with it cause I only get a haircut to improve the look of my hair.

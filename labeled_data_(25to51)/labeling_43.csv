I know this doesn’t take away the pain or feelings of isolation, but more people than you would believe feel this way.. especially with social media.. it can really inflame those feelings of loneliness or feeling isolated.

That said, considering it would be the most meaningful thing that you ever did, wouldn't you want it to be more... I dunno, special?

There's nothing inherently wrong with what you're considering, but maybe it could mean more than a flippant, dramatic, 1 act play starring *person a* processing a momentary sadness.

Seen it, wouldn't buy tickets.

I would encourage you to aspire to being more beautiful than what you see in the world. Really give an effort.

24939,m7qbvmj,comment,,"I read an account of a man who have jumped from the Golden Gate Bridge and survived. Like you, he felt depressed, alone and hopeless. He felt that ending his own life was the only choice he had left to end the pain.

And so he jumped. And in a random set of circumstances, he survived the fall, badly injured, but alive. But that's not what's interesting about his experience. 

What's interesting is his personal account of what happened when he jumped. Before he jumped he saw no path forward for himself. His struggles, challenges and problems all seemed insurmountable... until he was in freefall.

And then the only problem that felt insurmountable was how was he going to survive his fall. Because his mind crystalized around his other problems and he could see a path forward for all of them. And the only problem he didn't know how he would solve is the problem of surviving this fall.

The problem with depression is that it narrows your thinking, it collapses your ability to see opportunities, it degrades your ability to problem-solve, it makes you feel there are no options, that you're on rails, and there's only one destination.

Depression literally cripples your ability to see other possibilities, other outcomes, other options. It's a terrible disease of the mind, but it's treatable. But not if you're dead."," I read an account of a man who have jumped from the Golden Gate Bridge and survived. Like you, he felt depressed, alone and hopeless.

Making friends is hard after your teenage years and that happens to all of us. It's not worth killing yourself over, you're still young and got plenty of time to make friends, just need to keep trying, work colleagues are not friends, they are just people you work with, if you want to find friends you need to look in places where you share the same interests as the people. For example if you have a favorite video game or TV show or anime or YouTube channel, there's community's out there to meet people. If you're thinking about killing yourself you should talk to your doctor or a therapist, there might be some anti depression medication you can take that might help you feel better. First thing is first, if you want people to care about you you need to start caring about yourself first. Learn to love yourself for who you are, don't fee sorry for yourself, encourage yourself to beat depression and get out of your current situation. We are rooting for you bud.

You don’t need others to measure your value. You have it, with or without them. You deserve love, and to love yourself. ❤️

If I can do it, you can too. I believe in you. And I’m not just saying that as some sort of generic ‘I believe in you internet stranger’; I really do believe in you because you remind me of myself. You have it in you.

My gift to you is read a free online pdf of both Eckhart Tolle “The Power Of Now” and Florence Scovel Shinn’s “The Game Of Life.” Trust me by 2050 probably 90% of those sleeping sheep probably won’t even be here anyways. 

Use this as an opportunity to go deeper and to connect something greater than all that’s manifested from that consciousness waiting for you, that heaven within that once connected, all around you while in a sense become heavenly. I come from my family or both my uncles and both my half brothers killed themselves and my mom is waiting for legal euthanasia and my sister gets suicidal on and off. I used to have suicidal ideation and was hospitalized a few times for but I’ve moved beyond that, life can get better, you can find a special connection, so don’t give up. 

Let this be a wake up call tonight look for a true divine happiness within, that is beyond the body in the mind and beyond space and time. You will learn to live in it yet beyond it, in perfect balance between a mystical and spiritual life and living a life of doing all the fun things in the world. 

Quitters never Win and winners never quit and you are a winner, you just have to let that winning energy manifest for you instead of being held back by the woes of life. You’re right where you need to be in life, to receive this message, this gift. Every snowflake falls perfectly in place. 

What if all the world it’s just a reflection of your consciousness pushed out but your consciousness is sleeping and dreaming that there’s no point to go on, it’s time to spiritually wake up and lucidly dream the dream of life and make it a life you’d wanna live again and again knowing your next life is this life. All this might seem strange words but it’s a seed that will grow within you. You can rise and learn to master your fate and see how your thoughts create reality and then learn to intentionally use your thoughts and build confidence and patience until you master this imaginal muscle and your faith muscle growing successful experiences. 

Dr. Joe Dispenza’s box meditation on YouTube it’s pretty good as well. Some people uploaded the setting and the walking versions. Someone gives an explanation somewhere on YouTube where your dropbox with the old are you and all the crap and then you draw a new box of all this crap things resolved and take yourself out of the old box, erase/white yourself out of the old box and put yourself in the new box. And if you get dispenses box meditation helps you connect to a greater reality that’s beyond human power to connect with that future you that has everything resolved and bring it here and now. This is a practice he wanted to daily when you go to bed or when you wake up until it all becomes so. Anyways check these things out, you’re just didn’t get the spiritual training to deal with the world that can be filled with so much horrors at time now you can have that.

I hope you have a fantastic day and in place of a gift, I'll tell you something. Ok?
You are the master of your own destiny.
You are more than capable of forging ahead through life and you don't need friends or even family to enjoy it. You have to go and see Coldplay, that's not even up for debate! 
You'll be surrounded by fans who love the band just Iike you do and you'll have an amazing experience! Trust me. You know what, you could totally make some new friends there too. Or even meet ""someone special"". 
When you get back home, you'll be buzzing with happiness. 
The following morning, you should get up at dawn and still be full of that positivity.

Make yourself a light breakfast and then grab your water bottle and travel to a local park or waterway or natural reserve. Something like that, you know? 

Then just walk around it for an hour or so. Breathe in that fresh air and look at your surroundings with a different set of eyes. 

Bask in the Sun's light as it begins to rise higher in the sky and watch carefully as small birds whistle and call to each other, showing off with their aerobatic antics, embracing the new day before them. 

They have far less agency than us when it comes to their circumstances and if you think about it, their lives can be brutally short. They never let that stop them though. They treat every day like it could be their last one.

You are in a better situation than you are able to comprehend right now but that's not your fault. You can't see it from the inside looking out but we can see it because we're looking at it from a different perspective. 
There's nothing wrong with being sad. 
Even being miserable. Life will throw these challenges at us and we have no choice but to deal with them ...but here's the trick.

After you've already suffered the worst, everything from that point forward is a walk in the proverbial park. 

When you've finally soldiered through this dark spell you're experiencing, you'll find that other problems and concerns are now little more than water off a duck's back. Meaning they just slide off you because you've been through adversity.

Appreciate yourself. Try to love yourself. 

On a winter evening, curl up with an awesome book, only a single lamp to read by as the rain rakes across the roof and the wind howls it's encouragement. 

Get yourself a pet. An older cat that needs a new home, for example. You'll fall in love with each other.

These are just a few examples of how life can be beautiful in the most understated ways.

In six months, this bleak moment that you're experiencing will be nothing but a bad memory, so please don't make an unalterable, drastic decision for such a temporary problem.

Kind Wishes."," Happy Birthday!

I know what you’re describing is loneliness, not solitude, but it’s VERY common for people to not have a lot going on for their birthdays. I’m also 28 and I’ve only been to like maybe 2 or 3 birthday dinners over the last few years. And they were very very lowkey. 

Don’t measure your worth by how many people celebrate you. Nurture your hobbies and find communities online of people with similar interests and branch out from there. I wish you all the best.

I would love to be your friend, I’m not sure if I live close to you or you’d like to but if you’d ever wanna hang out I’d be delighted to get to know someone new and have a new friend! I’m not sure if you game at all but I also do as well I have a PlayStation 5 and pc so if you happen to have either platform then that would be awesome! 

I also read and love books and hiking as well!

I experienced something similar, once I had thought of taking my life, I had been rejected by someone I thought held the same feelings as I did & I even had plans of going to a concert with her, since she rejected me I wanted someone else to go with me. Parents were busy I think, siblings were not interested, friends also not interested or busy. 

In the end I went alone & had a great time, after that I started to do stuff on my own more often, also decided to improve my self confidence; walking alone, going to places & interacting with whoever was there that was approachable or up for a small conversation. Taking up a hobby or learning something (play an instrument, a new skill) can help to.

25087,m7qlhzf,comment,,"Ok…..you may not be thinking about God, but He loves you! The Bible is FOR REAL and so is God and his son Jesus. I am betting you don’t have a church family. If you did, you would t be in this predicament you are in. I don’t know you, but I love you because you are a fellow human that needs help. I love people and love to help them. Pick yourself up and read these Bible verses for your own good. Only you can help yourself by accepting Jesus as our savior. 

Here are some Bible verses to bring comfort and encouragement to someone who feels that no one cares for them. These verses remind us of God’s love, care, and constant presence:
	1.	Psalm 34:18
“The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit.”
	2.	Isaiah 41:10
“So do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.”
	3.	1 Peter 5:7
“Cast all your anxiety on Him because He cares for you.”
	4.	Matthew 11:28-29
“Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.”
	5.	Psalm 55:22
“Cast your cares on the Lord and He will sustain you; He will never let the righteous be shaken.”
	6.	Romans 8:38-39
“For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.”
	7.	Jeremiah 29:11
“For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.”
	8.	Deuteronomy 31:8
“The Lord Himself goes before you and will be with you; He will never leave you nor forsake you. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged.”
	9.	John 3:16
“For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life.”
	10.	Psalm 139:13-14
“For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother’s womb. I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; your works are wonderful, I know that full well.”

These verses emphasize God’s enduring love, constant presence, and the care He has for each individual.

Dude I met 3 people in my life that talked about ending their lives: one was 57 year old whose whole life consisted of working at Walmart and spending half her paycheck at the local dive bar, she only considered ending her life when she was diagnosed with a cancer that would slowly kill her. The 2nd person was a homeless schizophrenic man who believed the end times were coming and the government was turning people into demons. The third person was my ex-wife who was bipolar narcissist who refused to take up any responsibility or discipline, and used sucide (along with false claims of assault) as a vehicle for getting things her way. 2 of those 3 people did end up taking their lives, and I'm still arguing custody of my 13 year old son with my ex.

I'm going to tell what's going to happen, your natural instincts will kick in during the actual attempt you'll panic, call an ambulance, get put under some 24 hour psych ward. This point your family will probably get called in, and you will feel shame and regret for ever entertaining such thoughts and for having someone being annoyed with having to watch you like you are some toddler.

So last year after a particularly bad year personally I asked my sister if I could come home that weekend. She said of course, and I did, and it was the best choice I could have made. I had the best weekend. 

Go to the concert. Find a new hobby or two. Next year, go home or go somewhere new. 

And check in with all of us! 

Talk to you soon."," Happy birthday friend!

25176,m7qq3vp,comment,,"Hey buddy I love you. I tried to host my first Christmas party this year (27M). I have a really strong friend group who all love me despite me being a bit of a black sheep in the friend group. I made a partiful event without really probing my friends for interest, I invited about 30 people, and a few days before I only had 3 confirmed guests. My heart sank, I felt unloved, and like a looser. I canceled the party. The night I was supposed to have it, ended up grabbing drinks with one of the 3 guys who rsvp’d. He ended up asking me “bro why did you cancel, X, Y, and Z friends were all gunna come we were really excited about it!”

Moral of the story; your friends love you, but with this kinda planning stuff at our age, you have to make definative plans with people for these types of hangs before you create any type of event. No matter how good a friend, desperation smells like shit, and if you cook something up without making plans with anyone in your friend group, no matter how good a friend, it’ll turn out like this. You feel like an outsider so you didn’t send direct invites prior to buying the tickets, but your friends also feel like outsiders not getting involved in the planning of it.

It sucks, it’s not right, and it feels weird cause it’s your good friends, but it’s how it goes unless your far & away the coolest guy in a friend group. Just don’t take it personally, and don’t let it butt hurt you. You should sell the 3 tickets, go by yourself, not to prove anything to your friend group, but to prove something to yourself.

25234,m7qtafy,comment,,"Hey so I hope you’re doing okay. Feel free to DM me if you want to talk.

I had a really great friend in HS. When we all graduated and went our separate ways he took a job out of state. Eventually he became more withdrawn. I hadn’t seen him in a year (school work and whatnot) and next thing I know his family is contacting me on social media, asking if I’ve seen him.

It took them 8 months to find his body. He had taken his life and tried to do so as far hidden into a field as he could walk. I’m thankful they found him.

You see, the issue was he thought nobody cared if he lived or died. And he ended it.

I miss him every day. I have dreams he is still alive and the call I got was just wrong that day I got it. I still remember his sister’s voice faltering at his memorial service as she tried to describe what she missed about him.

You absolutely will be missed by people. They will never heal. Call them today. Give them the opportunity to remind you that you matter to them even if they have been busy and haven’t reached out.

Don’t let them have the nightmares I do. 

Godspeed."," Hey so I hope you’re doing okay. Feel free to DM me if you want to talk.

You’re dealing with a lot - feeling disconnected from family, coping with bullying from your past, and feeling lonely on your birthday. That’s really heavy, and you shouldn’t have to carry it alone.
Those Coldplay tickets show that you’re someone who still believes in connection and hopes for joy - that’s beautiful, not terrible. Your vitiligo is part of what makes you unique, not something that defines your worth.

1 day after his birthday, i started at his work. We clicked even though we didn’t speak the same language and could only communicate through a translator app. 

Where i’m getting at is, we got married on my birthday last month. We only had 15 guests. Our best friends. Now, my birthday will forever be with my favorite people who i know care about me and he now has a new view on life.

My partner had to leave his country because his brother got killed by a cartel and they wanted him next. Move to my country not speaking our language. Got a job, literally lived at work cause he couldn’t afford anything. Had survivor guilt, decided that he was celebrating his birthday and the following week he was out.

1 day after his birthday, i started at his work. We clicked even though we didn’t speak the same language and could only communicate through a translator app. 

Where i’m getting at is, we got married on my birthday last month. We only had 15 guests. Our best friends. Now, my birthday will forever be with my favorite people who i know care about me and he now has a new view on life. 

Be patience, sometime life is absolutely spontaneous and surprising. By the way, my family all forgot my birthday this year and you know what f*** ‘em!",1,,2025-01-18 03:19:58,t3_1i3oqiz,,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1i3oqiz/todays_my_28_birthday_and_i_am_going_to_end_it/m7quhqw/,Neutral

25288,m7qwa7i,comment,,"Man, if you don't like your life, change it, but do not end it.

Is not always easy, but It is possible and worth it!

Dude look all you had done! You are level 28 in life!

Adult life sometimes sucks, but you are young to give up.


I have a similar situation, people in my life, are building their lives far away and we lost contact.
But the truth is, whenever I feel ""they forgot about me"" I remember, I also stopped paying attention or trying to contact them.
So, is a two way path.

I personally hate receiving birthday congratulations, but at the same time, make me sad not receiving more.
But that's because I'm very egocentric.


When I was younger, I had parties, for my bd every single year.
The peak, was around my early 20s, around 300 people come to my parties (not all were my friends, but who cares!)

And while I was getting older, my friends start to move to other countries, get families or they were busy to attend or I tried do it on the same weekend as superbowl (I don't follow sports, so I did not know) and guess what, I find out, most people prefer watching sports than coming to my party. (That one hurt)

I stopped doing parties, when less than 20 people showed, due to their busy lifes.

I'm not angry, it's was planned to happen, people grow up and have adult lifes.

All was EGO. I was not happy with big parties, I had my ego inflated and I was not sad, when people stopped showing at my parties, it was just my Ego getting hitted.

I start considering myself less important, less the spotlight of everyone's life and start feeling more satisfied of my achievements and what I want.

Focus on yourself, stop paying too much attention to what others are doing.

Quick tip? Close social networks, detox yourself from ""others"" and internet.
And go to therapy, it will help a lot.

I live alone , all by myself.  Sometimes it's great and other time's it's not so good. All my family lives outta state down south.  I can count on not having any family calling ,texting or just giving a shit about me on the holidays.  It becomes very difficult and I have contemplated many time about taking myself out. But I don't do the deed. You are a somebody . You do matter and people do care about you.. I care about you. If I didn't I wouldn't be sitting here typing this out on my phone for the last 20 mins. Yes  I'm slow. Fat fingers and everything is blurry up close and of course I can't find my glasses.  I only have 10 pair around my apt but can't seem to find one when I need them. I'm a older guy I'm 58. I can relate to what you wrote . I had to respond as it sounded like you were telling my story. Hey man. Don't ever give up !! Don't ever think you don't have value and nobody cares about you. I still have time's that I sink into my depression and isolated in my apartment for a week or more . I was really having alot of health problems.  Diabetes,  congestive heart failure, C O P D. I was passing out and was having a hard time doing anything a I would gasp for air when I walked across the room. So I figured we'll this will kill me and it almost did. I was sinking fast . But something inside of me said no.. I'm not done.. so I made a decision to get outta bed find some counseling and start taking my meds right . It's a slow process but I am trying to be a better person for me..I don't have any friends.  So if you want a friend I am here. Hit me up and I will give you my number.. no I'm not gay or looking for anything other than connecting with someone that is dealing with some of the feelings and depression like I am . Someone who gets it.. I'm in salem . Do not do anything that will cause harm to yourself or others. Your only 28 man . You got your whole life ahead of you. Think of all the possibilities and opportunities that are available to you right now. This is an exciting time to be alive. All the new technologies and discoveries that are happening.  Have you thought about going back to school? At 28 years old your just starting to becoming anything you want to be...there are some good people in this world.  Find some of them and live like you Wil never die. Ya know it just might be possible in your lifetime that they crack the code to aging and prolonging life spans from 70 and 80s to 100s of years of life .hang in there my friend.. life is worth living...

I turned 29 on Jan 2nd and I feel for you man we’re family because we are in the same generation and it seems like back in the days, people and community showed more love and compassion to one another and it’s the little things that count, that people often overlook. They aren’t perfect, and neither are you or me brotha. But that does NOT make you a terrible person. Us men tend to be harder on ourselves than we should be, but that’s the way the spirit made us. The most important thing above all is that YOU love YOU first and more than anyone else because you are YOU, and there is only ONE of you. We’re still BABIES brother we’ve barely scratched the surface of what lies ahead in life and it would really break my heart if you go through with it.

Don’t be so hard on yourself because the world is hard enough on us as it is brotha. You matter, you are important, and I’ll give you something uplifting to ponder upon. As a man created in Gods image,(I’m not religious, but spiritual) you don’t need anyone else’s validation or acceptance. It’s nice when we get it but you were made to be able to withstand the highs and lows of life. Look at what his son Jesus went through. Do you think he let all of the things that happened to him get to him? No! We were made in his image! There is strength and solace in that sentiment and I hope you can see it too brotha. You know what? EYE am here and if you ever need to talk just reach out and we can exchange numbers. EYE love you❤️! Don’t have an ounce of hate in my heart…. Ehh except for child predators, rapists. Fuck those guys 😂. But on a serious note, you belong here because if you didn’t you wouldn’t be here. Don’t deprive yourself and others of what life has yet to offer you and what you could offer to the world(family,friends,community, etc). It’d break my heart if I came back on here just to find that you ended it. I’ve thought about it but what keeps me going are those things I said earlier. I hope it helps even a little bit and I wasn’t making this about me and I hope you don’t think that. I just UNDERSTAND and wanted to show you I understand. Us men gotta be there for each other because we are the only ones who understand how one another feels! I hope this gives you some type of consolation in the fact that you are NOT alone. Your soul tribe is out here, there, everywhere. But the one soul that matters most in this life is thy OWN. Protect your spirit! Don’t ever give up. EVER! Because if you do, then this devil dog gon find yo ass and drag you back from whatever place you were not meant for yet. You have soooo much life and experiences ahead of you that you can’t even fathom so I’ll end this by kindly asking you to reach out to me if you ever need to talk brotha.

I hope you take this as a sign to keep living. I'm 29, a little over a year older than you, and I've had moments like what you're describing. The despair can get very intense.

Life does in fact get better, these best days are still ahead of you and I know how hard it is to walk alone and feel like no one would notice if you disappeared but they would. There are people who see you on a regular basis who would wonder where you went, there are people who see you in passing who are happy to see you and never say it. There is someone out there waiting to fall in love with you and there is a future where you feel full of life and love and just stop to feel the sun on your skin and the rain in your hair and snow on your tongue. 

You are here for a reason, even if you haven't found the reason yet. Know that you belong. It can feel so easy to give up, but it feels even better to look back and know that you didn't. Live for you, breathe for you. Three days grace music, a band, saved my life over 10 years ago. This was the first birthday in a long time I was happy, there were so many when I felt like you.
It is your life beloved, cherish every moment of it, we don't get forever but we get right now. I love you.
I don't know where you live but I'd go with you to that concert, I've been going to them alone because I refuse to miss things I love just because I don't have community. Don't miss out on everything that's meant for you. 

I hope this time next year you are surrounded by loved ones overwhelmed with excitement to celebrate you. I hope we both are.

Maybe that guy she married saved you from years of agony and heartbreak? Learn to love yourself. Being alone isn’t a curse sometimes it’s a gift. I’m not a religious but I use to have tons of “friends” now I barely talk to anyone maybe god removed me from so many people for a reason. Maybe there’s a bigger picture we yet can’t see. Go to that concert meet new people. You’ll have at least one thing in common with the thousands of people in that concert. Start from there.

I'm glad you posted and as you can see you're not alone. I've gone to some concerts by myself because I had no one to go with me. It was tough but I was determined to have a good time. I think that will be a great show and I hope someone on here is close to you and goes with you. Being alone is rough. My daughters are turning 22 this month and have their own stuff going on.

Or even finding some recommendations of some self help books if in person therapy isn't an option. Investing in yourself is the best thing you can do. Start with positive thoughts because your thoughts and words have power.

I’ve been in that dark place where you think that life isn’t worth living. Never make a permanent decision for a temporary problem, you matter and your life matters. 

On a side note, a couple of years ago Elton John was on his last world tour. The concert was around my birthday and none of my friends would come with me. I went by myself and I had the time of my life.

I hope things get better for you. If you need someone to talk to, DM me. I’ve always wanted to have a friend in the other side of the world."," Happy Birthday my friend!

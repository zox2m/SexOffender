1hemsex,post,is forced masturbation assault,"TW: SA involving a minor

I dont feel rightfully traumatized by this, but here goes nothing. 

  
basically, I was 11 when my older sister and a family friend peer pressured me to masturbate in front of them in a sleepover. Thankfully, it was beneath blankets but the family friend wanted to hear the ""sounds."" She told me to moan louder and that she wanted to hear the sound of 'stirring macaroni.' The thing is, they were 13 and both girls. I'm certain they picked up this behaviour from watching porn (my sister assaulted me a lot because of porn/anime she watched.) Before this, I was groped, molested by the family friend in front of a mirror while she made crude comments about my private parts.

  
I'm like, I don't know what I should feel. I go between feeling nothing about this to having panic attacks. I swing between ""worse happens to others,"" ""I don't deserve to be traumatized"" to ""I should be more traumatized.""",16,3.0,2024-12-15 06:32:41,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hemsex/is_forced_masturbation_assault/

I had realized when we were together that every first we had was nonconsensual but after we broke up so much hindsight hit me. every time I told him no and he wouldn't listen it was assault. that means it was pretty much once a week for about a year and a half. that's insane. that hurts so much. it makes me so angry. even the things that I began to do willingly, he would try to make me do things in public because he liked the risk of getting caught. I didn't. I told him no. he didn't listen. he never listened. he didn't stop when I told him to. he did it over and over and over and over and over again. and I didn't know how to tell anyone. if I told someone the first time anything happened I would have been protected. it didn't even start that bad I could have been fine if I told. it hurts so bad. he used me.

1heosvf,post,Coming to the realization that I am a victim ,"
I (22M) have come to realize that I am a victim of SA. When I was younger, I was molested by my younger male cousin, then a few years down the road from a female babysitter, then other sexual experiences within my life. Now, I‚Äôm stuck here thinking what the hell my sexuality is?

Long story short, I was always more mature for my age. For these experiences alone that I‚Äôve never spoke on, I‚Äôd always said they were something I understood at the time. Now, they‚Äôre something that has further affected me.

My further involvement of watching porn at an early age really did not help as well; causing me to be hyper sexual. To this day, I‚Äôm reliant off of porn and can‚Äôt seem to shake it.

I even looked at a younger photo of myself and nearly cried knowing how innocent I was. This wasn‚Äôt something anyone deserves, and now I‚Äôm considering myself as bisexual because of it (that could also be just preference).",1,1.0,2024-12-15 09:03:34,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1heosvf/coming_to_the_realization_that_i_am_a_victim/

1heqaek,post,How do I forgive myself for my risk taking behaviour that almost led to SA?,"While grieving the loss of a close family member I was involved in risk taking behaviour. I was talking to this guy whome I barely knew.Like Even then I knew I m not in a mental state to make sane decisions and I didn't wanted to talk to him further but then he insisted I should see him once and he would help me dealing with the grief otherwise I will keep spiralling and turn towards intoxication to find relief. And we were supposed to meet at a restorent nearby but he changed the meeting place just when I reached there and then insisted that we go to this park nearby. We were sitting and talking in a secluded area of public park and then he kept touching my shoulders initially I tried to tell him to stop but he did not stop so I froze for a brief time and could not think what to do. and then he tried slipping his hands under my clothes.Luckily somehow I was able to stop his actions at the earliest possible and convinced him that we should go now.Blocked him the moment I reached my home.
Now, he is a sexual predator. He is a sick bastard. But what had happened to me? Why did I talk to him?Why did I go to meet him? Why did I became ready to go to a secluded place with him(which I actually didn't know is so secluded,although I had heard about this place from my friends)?

1heqgxd,post,I want to share the times I think I was assaulted,"
1)
Thailand- I was 3 or 4 years old and had a problem with a sore on my butthole, idk what is was and still don‚Äôt know, at this time I was living in Thailand with my grandmama and grandpapa, they both took me to a well known like treatment person or like someone who knows medicine and herbs well? He gave my grandmother some grinded medicinal herbs to put it on me, at first he insisted that he put it on me, because I remember my grandmama arguing with him. My grandmama turns away to talk to locals in the area not far from him maybe 7-8 feet, standing beside her I hear the man call me over behind me and I was hesitant but went to him, he told me kindly that he was going to make me better and proceeded to pull my shorts down and put his disgusting fingers into me. This is a memory I have recovered recently because of my grandmamas passing away, I have thought about memories I‚Äôve had with her a lot and have only to remember this disgusting one. 

I don‚Äôt know who the man is or where this place was, but he is supposed to be a healer.

2) I was 11 or something not sure, I have moved to England because my mother has a English boyfriend, he is now my stepdad, my stepdad has a English friend who lives in Thailand, he visits with his son, we are all talking in the living room and I‚Äôm just a kid and start bouncy on my stepdads leg and then on him and his lap because I thought it was funny and meant no harm, I didn‚Äôt realise something like that could make him ejaculate and he went back to go change, I also remember this memory recently and now I‚Äôm writing this out it sounds fucking disgusting 
 
3) a house party at my mums friend, same age 11 or 12, there were many people, my mums friend had a 14 or something yr old son, he‚Äôs a few years older than me but not sure what exact age, he‚Äôs playing games in his room and so his mum tells me to go play with him and see what he‚Äôs doing, I wanted to play his console games with him but I guess he had made up his own game, he told me to play it with him and I agreed, he then started tickling my privates and I started laughing as i thought we were only playing, he does it a few times until I did it to him, apart from he didn‚Äôt laugh and just smiled at me so I felt uncomfortable and wanted to play the games again but he still wanted to play his game, a woman who was at the house party opened the door to see what I was laughing about before and he stopped but as she went her started again, I can‚Äôt remember the rest but I think I went downstairs to be with my mum, I didn‚Äôt tell her because I thought she would play it off as we were only playing.

I want to ask should a 14 year old know that doing something like that is inappropriate?

I have told me mum maybe just 2 years ago but she didn‚Äôt have much reaction and said ‚Äúmaybe he didn‚Äôt know it was bad‚Äù or something like that 

My mum is still friends with his mum and sometimes she visits her house still, one time she told me we were going to go shopping on a Sunday, I had thought that and my mum and stepdad knew I probably thought that, it was a Sunday and shops are closed at 4, we arrived there at at 4 and I didn‚Äôt realise until we are parked outside his house and I refused to go in and stayed in the car the whole time. They didn‚Äôt tell me they were going to their house unless I wouldn‚Äôt have gone",11,4.0,2024-12-15 11:10:06,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1heqgxd/i_want_to_share_the_times_i_think_i_was_assaulted/

m25ursx,comment,,"Looks like everything i wrote glitched out or wasn't approved or something. 
I was a uni student at the time, 20yo British doing an exchange semester in USA (Illinois) 
I went for a routine STI screening and in the UK this just involves handing over a swab that you perform yourself and hand back.
The consultant medic was a woman and instead of asking me to swab myself (which is standard in the UK) she had me strip down put on a gown and lay down. She then swabbed me but then said she would do a physical examination. First on my breasts (which i had never had and since never have) and then my vagina. She gloved, applied lube and inserted her fingers all the way inside me, then said she was 'checking my ovaries' and while moving her fingers around inside me used her other hand to prod around either side of my pubis. I'm not a medical professional but that has never made sense to me, nor did having any kind of physical examination alongside a routine STI screening, but I was in a different country and thought it might be standard. Americans and specifically any medics, is this standard or did this woman take advantage?",1,,2024-12-15 13:03:42,t3_1herdvb,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1herdvb/was_the_physical_exam_i_got_in_the_usa_as_a/m25ursx/

1hes6ax,post,Has anyone else who's gotten pregnant from being raped wanted to keep the baby?,"So earlier late last month, I was gang raped at my family's house back in Scotland, whilst I was back home for holiday.

I was hosting a group of seven guys from Brazil after a former classmate of mine asked told me that they were on a budget and were looking for cheap accomodation and long story short, I offered to just let them stay with me. Whilst I was hosting them for about a week, I also cooked them breakfast, joined them on road trips from Edinburgh to Glasgow and back and just spending time with them.

On the last night, they got drunk whilst having a bit of a party in my lounge, they started forcing me to drink with them, I tried to get away when they started trying to undress me and long story short, they tore off my clothes and spent the night taking turns raping me.

I woke up hungover, sore, had a headache and vaginally bleeding. 

On the 12th of December, a week after returning to the States, I found out I was pregnant. 

After a bit of time thinking about it, even though I got pregnant from rape, as I do want a child and do feel confident enough that I can raise a baby even as a single mum, I decided that I am going to keep the baby and continue with my pregnancy.

I know that many other women would have probably sought to terminate the pregnancy, not wanting to raise their rapists child, but the way I see it, even if my baby was conceived via rape, I do want to keep it as I see my baby as mine and not theirs.

PS: For anyone wondering, my parents weren't there as they now live in Spain for their retirement and my sister won't be back in Scotland until January next year, hence why I had my family's home all to myself.",47,34.0,2024-12-15 13:04:39,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hes6ax/has_anyone_else_whos_gotten_pregnant_from_being/

m265twb,comment,,"They‚Äôre a bunch of heartless monsters and they planned this while you were treating them with such kindness, making them feel at-home and accompanying them on their drives. And they knew that being from another country they‚Äôd probably never get punished for their crime, as they would be gone the next day. Very calculated and just plain evil.

I commend you on considering keeping the baby. My mother had a child from a similar situation and she put him up for adoption. Whenever she would mention it in a sad way, I would remind her that she was a good mother to me and she gave that child life with a family that couldn‚Äôt have kids, making her a good mother to both of us.

It‚Äôs totally your choice to keep the baby and if you‚Äôre single and your life‚Äôs direction wasn‚Äôt headed towards being with someone and having children, then you‚Äôd be making a positive out of such a terrible negative. One thing to worry about, and maybe you‚Äôd need good counselling to stay on track while recovering from this trauma, is that you may be constantly reminded of something terrible that was done to you. And I don‚Äôt know at what point, if ever, you‚Äôd be able to answer the questions that every child of a single mother (like myself) has about their father. You may need a good story to tell them until they‚Äôre an adult, as knowing they were conceived this way may be traumatizing to them. As an adult, they may understand and be thankful that you kept them and gave them a good life.

But if you‚Äôre strong enough to be confronted by your trauma, you‚Äôre ready to tell a good story to your child as they grow up, and you know that you won‚Äôt subconsciously treat them like a burden or a symbol of your trauma, then by all means, do what your heart tells you and stay strong. Again, I commend you on considering such a difficult choice.",13,,2024-12-15 14:27:23,t3_1hes6ax,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hes6ax/has_anyone_else_whos_gotten_pregnant_from_being/m265twb/

Some women decide that being pregnant is too painful and have an abortion. 

Some women decide that raising the baby would be too painful but don't want to terminate the pregnancy, so they put the baby up for adoption.

While some women are willing to have the baby and raise it.

Which option you pick is entirely up to you and what is right for your mental and physical health. It doesn't make you a bad person to choose one option over the others. 

I've heard of women who raised the baby, and everything worked out fine for them and the kid. Just remember, the decision you make should be what you want.

1hew0m8,post,I don't know what to believe,"Several months ago, I was laying in bed and suddenly ""remembered"" being SA'd when I was young. I didn't want to believe it, so I ignored it until today. It's still hard for me to believe.

But I've always remembered that day, and this is what I originally remembered: I had missed the bus home from school. I had a habit of doing that, despite the headcount system they had in place to stop that from happening. I remember being in the office, having them call my mom to pick me up, and then being sent outside to go to her. 

I waited outside for a bit, and saw this man walking towards me, on school property. I didn't recognize him, but figured he was staff of some kind. Next thing I'm speed walking inside, trying not to cry, telling the office my mom wasn't here yet. They tried to ask if I was ok, but I didn't really answer. I just wanted my mom - who did eventually get me, and apologized for the mishap. I was so disappointed with her.

But, like I said, several months ago, that changed. Everything I already remembered flashed in my head, and I felt so afraid and confused. That man who had been walking towards me - he assaulted me, and as I saw that happen in my head, I could physically feel everything. I saw another man approach and chase the person assaulting me away, but I think that part may have been wishful thinking as I was reliving this.

I'm just so confused. Why would someone do that in broad daylight, in the front of a school, no less? Was there a camera system then? If someone did chase him away, were police just never called? Why was I outside alone in the first place - something I remembered happening even before ""remembering"" this assault? Did everything just go wrong that day and allow this to happen?

I just don't know what to think. This isn't the first time I've had repressed memories of SA pop up, but the other is from my aunt. This was, as far as I remember, a total stranger.",2,1.0,2024-12-15 16:20:42,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hew0m8/i_dont_know_what_to_believe/
1hew1xp,post,I‚Äôm confused about my childhood and fawning trauma response. I‚Äôd appreciate advice.,"Confusion about my childhood and fawn response

I want to start off by saying that I don‚Äôt know if I got sexually assaulted as a kid. I know that sounds dumb but I can‚Äôt remember most of my childhood. I‚Äôm questioning if I was sa‚Äôd because of my behavior I display around men, and a memory that just came to me a few months ago. I do suffer from other trauma as a kid I‚Äôm just not sure if it was sexual too. But because of that trauma I‚Äôve developed a fawn response specifically around men, although I have seen improvement, I still can‚Äôt help fawning in sexual situations.

Before I get into what‚Äôs been happening, I want to start off by saying that my boyfriend has never pressured me into anything, he is patient and caring, and he isn‚Äôt the cause of my reaction. I‚Äôve notice that I would rather do something that makes me really uncomfortable than say no, I end up really hurting myself because of it and this has happened more than a few times. Most of the times this has happened it‚Äôs went like this, my boyfriend will do something that indicates he wants oral sex, I hesitate (because I don‚Äôt want to do it in that moment) but then I give in. I remember once he pushed my head down (normally I‚Äôm comfortable with this) and I kinda resisted but he kept pushing me down so I just did it. It‚Äôs so hard for me to even talk in these situations. When he‚Äôs done I end up feeling gross, guilty, and violated. But I was too scared to tell him this for awhile

Yesterday was the first time that I (kinda) spoke up. When we were having sex my behavior shifted (because I didn‚Äôt want to continue) and he took notice. He asked if I wanted to continue but it felt like I literally couldn‚Äôt speak. We stopped, and he was talking a bit, I think he realized I couldn‚Äôt exactly respond to him (I‚Äôve told him about how sometimes I just go non-verbal and I can‚Äôt control it). After a little while I could respond to him, and then he made a blue balls joke. I was already feeling shitty for stopping but this made it worse. I told him we could continue and that I wanted to (I didn‚Äôt) but he could tell I didn‚Äôt mean what I was saying. When we got dressed I started crying, he‚Äôs literally told me that I don‚Äôt owe him anything but I felt like it would‚Äôve been better if I just went along. It was the first time that we actually stopped when I didn‚Äôt want to do something and I don‚Äôt know if I would‚Äôve felt any better if I just gave in.

I‚Äôm confused by my feelings, that night I told my boyfriend how I would rather hurt myself than stop, he didn‚Äôt really know what to say other than he doesn‚Äôt want me to do anything I‚Äôm not comfortable with.

I‚Äôm so confused. Why do I feel like this? Is it the worst in sexual scenarios because I was SA‚Äôd?? Was I even SA‚Äôd? How do I stop this? What could my bf do to help?

(Sorry for the long text, but I would really appreciate some advice. Thank you.

1hewsjj,post,can't do anything about it ,"I was sexually assaulted by my ex from August 2023-August 2024 while we were together. most of the worst assaults happened in 2023. by worst I mean he forced things for the first time. after he forced something once, he'd convince me to let it happen again, and then I became a willing participant. much of 2024 was him trying to make me do sexual things in public or around other people which I would refuse to do until he forced it. but there's nothing I can do about it. I have no evidence. he might still have pictures of me underaged on his old phone but then I'd also get in trouble for ""distributing child pornography"" even tho I was the child being pressured into it. I have a couple journal entries and can give detailed stories about it all but that's all I can do.

1hexor7,post,"How to cope after a ""close call""?","Hi there folks. This is my first time here. Still figuring Reddit out, so I hope I managed to get both the question and coping ""flair"" things there. If not, if someone could tell me how to get them both to show, I'd appreciate it.

To spare a lot of unrelated details, I left a friendgroup a few months ago, wherein there was a guy who made me feel very, very uncomfortable. To give some context, I'm a transman in my early 20s and he was a cisman closer to 40. When I came out to this group of people after feeling safe enough to do so after a few weeks, he would start to message me over Discord, asking increasingly personal and strange things about my body and identity. The literal first thing he sent was ""So (name), do you have something to tell me?"" after the person who was in charge of this gathering explained my pronouns on my behalf (I had to leave and couldn't stick around that night, but we agreed he'd do so, just so everyone was In The Know, as it were).

Then the questions started to skew towards asking me what I wanted done with my body. What kind of parts I wanted to have, whether I wanted to be """"modest"""" about it. Just, generally very, very strange, invasive stuff that at the time, I was a bit put off by, but wanted to take him in good faith and try to offer insight and education to someone I thought just wanted to learn about people beyond his own lived experience.

Then, after a while of talking, he began to show ""concern"" that I didn't understand the ""side effects"" of affirming care. Following this, he began to try to rope me into conversations about Republican politics, Trump, and tried to show me ""un-biased news sites"" to ""expand my perspectives"".

All of this went on until I eventually just muted him over Discord so we only interacted in a public server or in person. During one meeting, emotions got high, I raised my voice at him (which was poor of me and I'll admit it was for stupid reasons), which later got me a message worded as ""I think we need to have another talk together before everyone shows up next week.""

It was Scary. I have had many experiences growing up of being assaulted and abused by guardians and authority figures, especially during my early school days. The tone and wording of his messages instantly triggered memories of a school counselor who I am fairly convinced molested me on several occasions (I say, because well I was a tiny child and it's a blur. But the feelings towards that specific memory are enough to me to say there's a high chance.)

I ended up just not answering. I came at the usual time, and he didn't say anything.

Now, fast forward, and right around the time I'd be leaving this space for good, this man tried to ask if he could bring a woman he was seeing at the time into our group to ""Talk through"" some parts of their relationship. Alarm bells. Just, instantly. Because next thing you know, several other men there are talking about ""accusations"" and the times they ""accidentally"" brushed against someone and everyone ""overreacted"", all while the group organizer just nodded and hummed and I sat there and finally decided I needed to get the fuck away.

Nothing """"happened"""" to me. I wasn't touched. I didn't send anything explicit. But the fear and the memories of how small and cold I felt in that moment still haunt me. As does the knowledge that he got away with that and will likely do this again to other people, but there's no evidence I can hold to make him pay for it, because I can't even go to ask other people who were there if he did anything to them due to the manner in which I left cutting all contact with everybody. The place where this group gathered is a store that's literally right down the road from a highschool. This also makes me feel so, so angry and so, so worried for other people he may try to harm.

Does anyone else relate? Any tips on ways I can work out the anger and maybe process or just...feel less shitty?  ",2,1.0,2024-12-15 17:35:43,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hexor7/how_to_cope_after_a_close_call/

m27hlgb,comment,,"I was the product of a rape of an adolescent girl in the United States. It was before *Roe v. Wade*, so my mother did not have the option of terminating the pregnancy. 

While I personally wouldn‚Äôt recommend anyone continuing an unwanted pregnancy (much less raising the child born from an unwanted pregnancy), if you are *certain* that you can raise the child without ever resenting how it came to be conceived, then your child will be fine. 

But if there is any possibility that you will look into the eyes of your child and see the face of one of your rapists looking back at you, or will relive the experience of being raped, I beg you not to continue the pregnancy.

Every child can sense how each parent feels about them, no matter how deeply buried in that parent‚Äôs subconscious. No amount of physical affection or verbal assurances can disguise the fact that, deep down, a parent believes their life would have been better without their child in it. Children can feel the difference at a level so embedded that it may as well be encoded in their DNA. And it only gets worse once they begin school and see (and feel) the fundamental difference in how deeply safe and loved their friends feel with their parents as opposed to the constant undercurrent of anxiety and fear of abandonment they feel around theirs.",20,,2024-12-15 18:58:30,t3_1hes6ax,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hes6ax/has_anyone_else_whos_gotten_pregnant_from_being/m27hlgb/

1hf0ihx,post,How i see my body after SA,"I don't even know why im writing that, maybe because i want to know if there are ppl who relate. Sorry

After my SA, i had so many problems like anorexia and stuff like that. I hate my body, i find it big, dirty, horrible. I didn't realize that it is probably related to what i lived. I mean, for all the teenagers it's difficult to accept their bodies, right?

So i wonder if what i feel is valid. So many ppl have lived worse situations than mine. I wasn't raped, i was 'just' touched. But still it hurts me, it hurts me so bad.

I hate how i look. Im disgusting. People keep telling me im pretty and i have a nice body. Fuck it. I don't want that. All i wanted was to be a kid and he couldn't let me be. He had to do all that stuff and take control. He had to hurt me. Even when i said no. What have i done for that? What did i do wrong? He destroyed my innocence and told me it was okay. No it was not.

There was a time i was so into anorexia that i barely even ate 200 kcal and did 3 hours of sport per day. I found my body so big, even if i was at 42 or 43 kg. I wanted to look like Wonyoung, like Ros√©, like perfect celebrities who seem happy and pretty. It was never enough, i wanted to be 40kg, 35kg. I stopped at some point because i couldn't stand on my feet.

Then i had struggles eating again.

Now it‚Äôs the opposite. I eat and i don't care. I look at my body and i think 'anyways im dirty and disgusting'. I was like 45 or 46 kg the last time i weight myself. Im scared to do it now. I eat until im full but i hate it.

And sometimes, i feel disgusted by any kind of food, i feel like im gonna vomit just by smelling it. It reminds me of how i felt with anorexia.

And now i realize that all of this, it's because i can't love that fucking body he touched. Because no matter what i do, it will never be enough. I don't feel like this body is mine, i don't feel like it could ever be.

I feel so dirty and exposed. When im just walking in the streets, i feel in danger, im uncomfortable. I want to run and escape and cry. And I can't even look at my body, i can't even do that, i know he touched it and it disgusts me.

Can anyone relate or am i just crazy?




Edit : no hate to Wonyoung, Ros√©, or other celebrities, they are beautiful",2,1.0,2024-12-15 19:42:11,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hf0ihx/how_i_see_my_body_after_sa/

I‚Äôve always felt like no one would want me because I‚Äôm damaged goods and I think it‚Äôs because a couple years ago I was forced to see my cousin irl after years had passed since the incident, he basically took me into a corner and laughed in my face about what happened almost trying to downplay it but there was no reason as a 6 year old I had any business following him into bathrooms so he could touch me. And I‚Äôm just so angry with him and myself at the same time because as a result of what he did I was groomed by a man in his 40‚Äôs when I was around 11/12 because he let me rant to him, and he made me feel safe but eventually he revealed that he wanted to do the same things to me. I guess now I‚Äôve been struggling I want to be myself but I feel like I‚Äôve been robbed of that feeling I don‚Äôt feel like myself in my own skin and I‚Äôm not sure what to do about that.

1hf34dm,post,I saw my grandfather today and it upset me,"*Massive Rant* TW: CSA, mention of extreme violence 

My grandparents have two houses they travel between in different states. So when they are out of state, I go stay with my Dad who lives in their house while they're away. I usually go stay with dad because of stress. Or just to visit, etc. But whenever I hear my grandparents are coming home I usually rush to move out like I was never there. 

My grandfather is a horrible monster. My grandmother walked in on him abusing me as a little child in the bathroom cus she heard me crying for him to leave but he never got any consequences beyond her screaming at him ""SHE'S JUST A CHILD"". Ever since that day everybody acts like it never happened. Even though for years I'm vocal about it. I'm 27 now and I've gotten over the people pleasing thing. It's gotten harder and harder over the years to push the trauma down and play ""happy family"" with an incestuous pedophile for Christmas and Thanksgiving. Dad gives me the silent treatment and goes ""that's my dad you're talling about >:("" and hangs up on me or literally walks away from me like a ghost whenever I talk about it or have anxiety attacks. 

My grandparents were coming home today with basically zero notice but I rushed back from picking up lunch for me and my dad and didn't make it in time so they were already home. I grabbed my stuff and tried to interact as little as possible. My grandfather said ""hey"" and I just nodded keeping my head down focusing on leaving. He gets this pissed off entitled, surprised, then angry face as he lunges into my face with a very forceful ""Hey?"" Which sounded extremely aggressive and he was in my face like he wanted to hurt me. My dad watched this too. I had this dead expression on my face and just snapped back ""hi"" in the most unenthusiastic ""I fucking hate you"" tone, dismissive and cold. As much as I could manage. He kinda just reeled back in shock and walked away and I didn't even look at him and walked out the door. Dad looked really sad.

It honestly felt good for me. My grandfather is a horrible man, everybody knows he's a pedophile.  He abused all the women in our family apparently. I knew it stung not giving him the respect he feels he's entitled to as ""head of the household"". I felt empowered.

I drove home thinking about what I'll say at his funeral, fantasizing about wearing a t-shirt of my face as a kid and standing before everyone making sure he's remembered for what he is and I'll end it with ""I outlived you, my abuser, and now you will only be remembered as what you are."" Then... Disowning my family who I already dont even talk to. Watching them reel in anger as I also walk away from this ""family"" like my cousins did. I know I'd probably never actually do it, but imagining myself having my moment of being able to speak makes me feel better. I will outlive him and he doesn't deserve any respect from me. I'm just so done playing happy family and all the stress of being around a horrible man who thinks he's the king of the world despite how horribly he treats everyone around him.

He's also incredibly abusive. He talks about murdering and beating us. How happy he gets at the idea of murdering us. He's a scary man. The family has massively distanced over the years and I finally am too. He brags and reminisces how he abused all of us and talks about how he wants to do it again or do what he did to his daughter to us. He's scary. And i resent my grandmother for just never defending ant of us and standing by a horrible man. My dad doesn't see it ans thinks he's a great man but the only great thing about my racist abusive pedophile grandfather, is that he's a great big asshole.

1hf4mcz,post,Why i hate Christmas.,"Does anyone else hate Christmas due to their assaults? I know it's a weird question but I have my reasonings.

3 years ago I was r*ped at 17 by my first love, he was 56 (don't judge me). My dad eventually found out and the police were called.
It was a lengthy process that scarred me quite frankly.

Anyways, the reason I hated Christmas was the only time the police could do my interview was on Christmas eve. I had to go into detail about what happened after blocking it out for months.

After that, I couldn't enjoy Christmas. I've got black out drunk every year since and always cry. I used to love Christmas and now I can't without thinking about him.

It's a hard time of year for my family in general and my dad has told me not to let him win and ruin my Christmas but it's so hard for me not to, especially since after all that trauma, he didn't get arrested and lives 5 minutes from me. Its unnerving.

1hf4o8e,post,warning: i am a minor.,"for context this happened yesterday, ive had a few similair experiences and i have been raped before but i dont know where it stands on the sexual assault scale. 

yesterday i was lining up to catch a bus, the station is in town centre and it was a lot busier than usual. as i was lining up i felt some hands around my coat pockets and moved forwards because i thought someone was trying to steal from me. this man stumbles forwards as i move and his hands were still on my like hips/waist area. i turned to look at him and he just smiled at me. he did take his hands off but he was standing really close to me, like i could feel him breathing on the back of my neck and my back was basically touching his stomach. 
i dont know if it was like a sexual assault or if it was just someone being a dick. 

i am 15 years old, and i have had a few experiences of guys being like this while on the bus before, even by a bus driver a few month ago making comments and not letting me off the bus. 

idk i jusy feel really weird over it all, and it keeps reminding me of when i was raped last year and i just dont feel right. 

but was it even sexual assault?

1hf4zjo,post,My Mum got inappropriately groped,"I met my Mum in the town centre to help with a bit of shopping. She is 67 and struggles to carry heavy shopping. Especially with Christmas coming up, she has been wanting to get out and do some shopping.

We met up. Went in a few shops together as we made our way down the high street. And we got to the last shop before we head home, a small food supermarket. As we were walking down I lit a cigarette and she went in the shop before me as I was still outside smoking. This is when it happened.

It's been a few days before she finally told me the truth about what happened. I had no idea at all.

I finish my cigarette and go in to get a few things I needed and I'm about half way around the supermarket and she rings me to ask where am I. She had already finished shopping and was outside. But sounded really stressed. So I finish up quick and go out to catch a taxi with her to drop her home with her shopping and then take me home. It's physically draining on her to go out shopping so I just thought she was a bit tired and wanted to go home. I had no idea what happened in there. It might not seem that serious to some but it's my Mum and it's still not right.

It's been a few days and I've just rang her to check in and say goodnight. I do this every night at around 9.00pm and she has had a glass or 2 of wine so is being talkative.

She said that when she went in the shop before me that day there was a couple in there and as she opened one of the chest freezers and leaned over to pick an item out the man inappropriately groped her behind and in-between her legs. She was worried to tell me at the time because she thinks I'd have murdered the dirty pervert.

She apparently told him that's not funny. He was laughing. In front of his wife or partner who was shaking her head and telling him to walk away. He was still laughing and apologising liknit was allmjust a joke and nothing to moan about.

He then approached her again as she tried to make her way to the till still joking and making it all out to be a joke but making her feel intimidated.

She got to the till and told the lady on the checkout what happened and even while she did that he was still approaching her at the cashier till with a funny attitude laughing as if nothing was wrong.

The lady on the till asked if she was OK and she just wanted to get out of the shop. At this point I've finished my smoke and I'm in the shop but about half way around the store still doing my own shopping but I hadn't seen her in there so had no idea what had happened.

My Mum gets outside and can't see me, so rings me quite stressed so as I mentioned I just finished up, and went outside to meet her and ring the taxi home.

She has only just told me now when I rang to say goodnight. This is a few days later so it must have been bothering her and upsetting her still.

I must have crossed paths with the dirty pervert and his wife when I was in there but I was in a world of my own and can't for the life of me remember who I saw in the shop.

Something like this happened before but the guy was bullying her form money when she would go to the town to shop. And she told me. And I assaulted the guy. It caused a lot of stress for her but I stand by what I did at the time. It's my Mum. If anyone touch her or upset her and I will kill them. So I think she was more worried at the time to tell me, knowing I'd have gone back in the shop and confronted the fucking weirdo while he was still there.

I can't remember who I saw in there but she did report it to the checkout lady and it must be on camera.

So I don't want to cause her more distress but am thinking about going back to the store and making a complaint. It's sexual harassment or even sexual assault as he physically and inappropriately groped her.

My Mum doesn't want the embarrassment of it all and having police going to her house as it's a really quiet neighborhood and she would have to explain to the neighbours why the police were there and also go through the stress of it all again.

Am I allowed to ask the store to make a criminal complaint and get the CCTV footage to show police, but without her needing the stress of it all? As I said she's elderly and quite distressed from it.

TBH I really just want to see that CCTV footage to see him. It's not a big town we live in and I just want to have a 'word' with him.

What can I do to help her? I've spoken to her and said that I won't do anything but if she wants to file a complaint then I'll be there to help with it all.

1hf5448,post,I don‚Äôt know anymore,"I was 15 when I was in a relationship with an older man who had a two year old daughter at the time. He wanted me to be the mother to her since her mother had disowned her. So I wanted to step up. He was a teen father but an adult at this point. 

Anyway I thought I had really loved this dude. Until the day that supposedly I thought I lost my virginity. I knew damn well that I was raped while he allowed me scream at the back of his car in pain telling him to stop or to slow down. To which never happened. My body went into total shock. And I was in pain. I was bleeding when I had went to the bathroom later that day. 

About two weeks later he had fondled me on my living room couch while I pleaded with him to stop until I finally had to fight him off of me. And I just continued to yell at him to leave. 

Eventually we broke up after that. And my mother spoke about me ruining him and his daughter‚Äôs life because of the things he done. I had gotten the police involved and had given them his name and etc. but my mother tried convincing me to not press charges. So I didn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs been over a year and my body still doesn‚Äôt feel like mine. 

I had tried killing myself multiple times but none of it worked. I was just in a more lethal position. I wish I had done something sooner. It‚Äôs already considered illegal because it was sex with a minor and that‚Äôs the only evidence I have of it. I had almost gotten pregnant from it and my father told me that I would have to keep the baby of my rapist and live with him if I did get pregnant. Well, my mother wanted me to have an abortion if I was because of the medicine I‚Äôm on. 

I stopped speaking to my father after that. But now I live in the realization that my body is no longer mine and I had let him get away with it. ",0,1.0,2024-12-15 23:12:38,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hf5448/i_dont_know_anymore/

1hf5dnd,post,I feel violated by a man I dated briefly ,"I broke it off today after a week. It took a lot of courage because he was scary af. Moods all over the place, he's older, super controlling, etc. I was scared to cut it off days before but finally got it off my chest and he reacted calmly and left but I am still terrified. I woke up at the hotel we stayed at for a night and found my bag was open. Nothing was taken but I had lock my card just in case. I don't know what he was looking for but he woke up randomly which he does a lot and I saw him making his way over to my bag the first time and he turned to look back at me and I was looking right at him.  He played it off and I played it cool but I was suspicious and low and behold I wake up to my bag open.

We had sex on the first date. Spare me the lecture here, yes I know I dumbly handed myself down to a man I barely knew but he's very in shape and we were having a good time before that. Anyways, we had sex and he came inside of me. I panicked. I consented to sex but not to that. I didn't say anything before because what idiot cums inside a woman he just met!? So, he could see I was panicked and I asked him why he did that. He shrugged and said don't worry I'll pay for Plan B which he did but nonetheless still feeling uneasy.

I bring it up again the next day on our second date and he gets mad, ""You took the plan B I paid for right? It's our second date and you wanna bring this shit up now? Always with some negative shit. You're an adult right? Speak up next time."" Again, I didn't think a dude I just met would fucking free rain inside of me so I didn't know that was something that had to even be said.

Yes, I continued to see him for the next few days because he scared me. He was super controlling, possessive, and manipulative within a short amount of time. He never put his hands on me but he's a bare knuckle boxer so he's a big guy and he had a temper on him. He'd belittle me for not laughing at a joke when he was cracking up, turning my head (not on purpose) when he'd go to kiss my neck or cheek, talking about anything he deemed negative.  Being with him quickly became smothering. Also for context, he is 7 years older than me. I am 27 and he is 34.

Yesterday at the hotel I gave him a massage then he proceeded to berate me on how short lived it was. My hands and shoulders really hurt because I was putting my whole body into it. I said, ""Well, I'm not a masseuse."" He narrowed his eyes and said, ""Oh, ok...no problem. I'll just hire one and when I have a female touching on my whole body I don't wanna hear it."" I laughed at the ridiculousness of what he said and said, ""Ok."" There was so much tension in the air and I was knots about even going to this hotel but I thought just play the part one more day because we planned this and then break it.

I don't know if it was revenge for my comment but we had sex yesterday at the hotel. I felt like I couldn't say no so I let it happen. This time around he was extremely rough. He pinned my head into the bed really hard, he was very rough and he knew it hurts to go deep and he kept going very deep with each thrust, even holding it. I was yelping in pain but I was too scared to tell him to stop, I wanted to cry and I was too scared to even do that. It happen and I said nothing. Next day comes around, I tell him I want to end things and he's nonchalant about it. I find out he's unadded me on everything so hopefully that's the end of him. He made me tell me I was his while doing all of this. He was definitely getting off on hurting and dominating me. 

Am I wrong to feel violated after this event? I feel like this is a big lesson but what else can I take away from this traumatic experience? I'd also like to add I didn't want to have sex, it was written all over my face and I was very stiff but I never said no and even when he was hurting me and I was yelping in pain I never told him to stop because I was fearful.

I haven‚Äôt even brought up the subject during any of my therapy sessions at the moment.

There‚Äôs still so much to discuss with my therapist, and for me to work through the trauma I‚Äôve endured before I‚Äôll even have any thoughts of intimacy. :(

Ever since i was molested i cant have joy durinf sex or even masturbation anymore. I need to have tv on in the background to not be flooded with the memories of it. My brain constantly flashes memories of the guy that molested me. 

I now feel like I'm just an object. When i just masturbate, I feel like im doing it for someone elses satisfaction. 

It doesnt help that macochism is the only way I get off. Even before i was molested i only gpt off to being tied up and used. But now the things i want are more extreme. I want to be spanked hard. I want to be called a slut. 

I hate that being molested changed me so much. 

Every time right after i orgasm, i immediately have the same feeling i get right after i self harmed. I feel completelt used, even if i was just masturbating. Even while im masturbating, im questioning why i have the fantasies i do. I love porn but when i watch it im wondering if the woman in the porn actually wanted to be there.

Also, I have a really high sex drive and want it once or twice a day.


TLDR: I used to love being powerless, but after being molested, its the worst feeling for me, but its the only way i get off.",5,2.0,2024-12-16 01:00:56,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hf7bam/being_molested_ruined_my_sex_life/

But I was assaulted on a first date by a guy on a dating app, and I just really don‚Äôt trust my judgment right now, and I can barely leave my house for anything, and between counseling and dealing with medical complications and the legal case, I‚Äôve got more than I can to deal with timewise with all of it then to be talking to all these guys and going on dates and traveling as most of these guys live long distances away. I‚Äôve had a couple guys hit on me since the assault and they were friends that all of a sudden came out and said that they had always had a crush on me and really liked me, and it was so weird and disturbing, even though I know, they would never try anything physically with me without my consent, I just panicked and needed to get away from them ASAP. So I can‚Äôt imagine what it would be like with a stranger that showed interest. And I don‚Äôt even know how to go about having a conversation with somebody about how I am ‚Äúdamaged goods‚Äù because I have this aspect to me that I can‚Äôt heal and that I carry with me for a lifetime. I‚Äôm not calling anybody else in here. ‚Äúdamaged goods‚Äú it‚Äôs just kind of how I feel about myself right now and I don‚Äôt see any end in sight.

Some of the questions were;

‚ÄúDo you know if he had a pain fetish?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat did it feel like when he grabbed your neck?‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhat are your noises usually like? Regular moans?‚Äù

‚ÄúWere you in pain whilst making the grunting noises?‚Äù

‚ÄúDid it feel good at all?‚Äù
(referring to me being raped)

I just find it unusual these were the only questions. The only other message I got was their first message of them asking me my age and then asking me to describe in detail what happened.

I told them they were making me uncomfortable with the questions and now when I go on the profile it just says failed to load so I think they have blocked me.",9,14.0,2024-12-16 01:28:21,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hf7usr/are_these_normal_questions_to_be_asked/

is it valid not to report it out of fear of thinking it wasn't that bad? and as well as believing he dosent deserve to be reported, everytime i tell my therapist about flashbacks or panic attacks correlated to it she mentions if i ever reported it, i just feel he wasn't mentally stable either, i hope he has a fresh start",2,1.0,2024-12-16 01:37:19,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hf80wn/rant_and_questions/

1hf97tk,post,Did I (29F) SA My Ex (32M) Once While We Were Together and Once After We Broke Up?,"I'm pretty sure I did. Once before we moved in together, we were playing and I was poking him all over and then, in the hyper mess of the moment, I poked his privates suddenly and he went through a huge traumatic response contemplating self harm and did not overcome it until months after we had already started living together in a new apartment. For the next 6 months of living together, things seemed tense and then neutral. He broke up with me after 6 and a half years claiming we were a bad fit and in reality, we did have a lot of other underlying problems. I did not respond well and ended up ugly crying and sobbing among other poor reactions because it caught me off guard, I had started a new medication and I was convinced we could overcome anything and be together forever despite the conflicts. The next two months after breaking up, we continued to live together, switching off couch and bed. These two months were filled with ups and downs until this week where we had reached another stage of closure but became sexually involved again for a day per his request. That same day, he became sick, I took him to urgent care and fed and took care of him all knowing this wouldn't change his mind. While I took care of him, I would kiss him a lot or show him softer forms of physical affection. He said he enjoyed it and that it was nice. The next day he was more ill and sweatier. I went in to kiss him on the cheek a few times and he said no three times and I just thought it was because he was self conscious about being sweaty since that was an occasional insecurity of his through our relationship. I eventually pulled away and continued looking after him with less physical touch. Day three of his illness, he is feeling better but has brought of the previous day's incidents of me not pulling away when he said no. I responded that I misread the situation but he has gotten increasingly uncomfortable with the situation every hour since we discussed it. I mentioned my own experiences with SA and how I struggled empathizing with something that may not have been as aggressively traumatic as my own experiences but that should not have diminished his own experience and wishes. He is now in a darker place, does not wish to see me and says every time I enter to check in on him, he feels worse. I don't know what to do. He does not want to talk about it to his friends and his next therapy appointment is in two days. I know there is someone he has been venting to about the uglier parts of our relationship including a vaguer mention of my first SA incident towards him. But he doesn't know I know about this person but I know he needs to talk to someone other than me about it. He is mad at me, he is hurt, I don't want him to go anywhere darker and consider self harm again but I also want to check in on him every 5 minutes which would only make things worse. I assume he will probably speak to that person at some point when he is ready. He is set to move out in the next two weeks but I want to give him his space and stay at my sister's home while she is out of town. I'm struggling to cope with my own actions and have considered punishing myself as well but that only ends up selfishly victimizing myself",0,2.0,2024-12-16 02:39:58,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hf97tk/did_i_29f_sa_my_ex_32m_once_while_we_were/

1hf9pzn,post,"In 1996 I was raped by a stranger in who was never caught. Now at 46 yo, I am having nightmares about it. And my mom thought it was my fault.","I was raped by a random stranger back in 1996. I was 18 years old and coming back home after a night out. I had no money to take a cab home, so I decided to take a bus. Late at night, I took another bus, that would take to my neighborhood, but I had to walk some more blocks to get home.

While I was walking home, I was walking really fast, I see someone passing by me running. I didn't care about this person, so I minded my own business and kept walking until I reached the next corner...

The same guy who had passed by me, was waiting for me at the next corner. He grabbed by the neck and told me not to scream or he'd kill me. I froze. He then dragged me to an empty lot (which I had already passed by). There in this lot, he forced me to strip down my pants, lay down on the lot and then he did what he took me there for, he assaulted me with penetration and after doing ""his business"",  he let me go and vanished into the night, not before asking me if I had enjoyed it as much as he did and he asked if I liked going to the beach (my hometown was a coastal town in Brazil) and if I did, we could even meet again on the beach. I remember yelling something like ""you're a fuckin maniac"". Then he vanished into the night.

I reported the assault to the police (at this point hiding the assault from my family), but unfortunately, the police didn't do much about it and to make things worse, when my mom found out, she had the nerve to BLAME ME.

I then decided to move on with my life, I was determined not to let this ""mishap"" shape my life, so I took a path with some pretty bad choices in all aspects of life. Probably the only right thing I did was to move to Europe and start a new life. I pretty much forgot about this event up until recently, when I started the perimenopause period and my life again has turned upside down.

28 years later I can still smell his alcoholic breath on my face and sometimes I wake up feeling his body onto mine. Out of the blue I have intrusive thoughts about that night that changed me forever.

28 years later, a lot of questions pop up in my mind:

\- why me?

\- why didn't he kill me?

\- was I his only victim? Were there other girls?

\- does he still remember me as I remember him?

\- is he still alive?

The worst thing is that I might never have closure because he was never caught. I did try therapy, but I could never really ""connect"" with any of the therapists I tried.

Writing this here is my desperate attempt to try to find out why 28 years later, I'm having these thoughts, why am I bringing back such hurtful memories?",28,9.0,2024-12-16 03:06:54,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hf9pzn/in_1996_i_was_raped_by_a_stranger_in_who_was/

1hf9vrr,post,All subreddit members - Please Read ,"No more comments making any kind of reference to or any kind of mention of a ‚Äúnew private server‚Äù or anything else similar.

This new hidden subreddit/ private server is in no way affiliated or connected to this sub and therefore it should not be mentioned on here. The owner of this alternate subreddit was last week advertising it on here in loads of comments on different members post threads and they didn‚Äôt have the permission of this sub to do so.

More worryingly, this person and owner of this sub, who was doing that has only been a member of Reddit for LESS than 2 months, nobody knows their true identity and who they are , what their background is, what their intentions are, what their credentials are, NOBODY knows a single thing about them.

They made the unsubstantiated and unfounded claims that their hidden sub was completely free of creepy, freaky and dangerous Reddit accounts when a user posted in this sub raising the issue of them being sent unsolicited DM messages from creepy users and a huge amount of you all believed their claims and all asked for this sub‚Äôs name and for invites to be sent to them, YET not a single one of you even took a step back for a few minutes and asked yourselves about the legitimacy of any of it or even asked yourselves any questions about it.

There‚Äôs been absolutely no due diligence done at all about this sub or this particular person who is the owner of it.  They made a huge amount of comments advertising it to everyone yet they didn‚Äôt even bother to be respectful of our sub rules here asking for our permission to make these comments advertising it.

They claimed to be a victim and survivor of sexual assault themselves, well any genuine and legitimate person who is a victim or a survivor of sexual assault would of at least read the rules of this sub out of respect for this sub and out of respect for the members of this sub BUT THEY DIDNT!! Not even as a courtesy.  If they can‚Äôt even do something as simple and basic as that and follow and respect our sub rules, then what makes you think that they are genuine and that they are going to have the appropriate safeguards and rules for their new sub?

Finally I just want to reiterate the fact that this person‚Äôs Reddit account is only about 40 days old since they first created it, I‚Äôve permanently banned creeps from this sub when I have caught them out, who‚Äôs Reddit accounts have been created 4, 5, 6 months and more ago when I banned them, YET a big majority of you members here have put your complete trust and faith into this person who hasn‚Äôt even been on here for more than a couple of weeks!!

The various popular subreddits on here which all focus on the topic of sexual assault and or rape in a support context are ALL at risk of their sub members from being contacted, totally unsolicited, by privately message from creeps, we do a lot more behind the scenes than you know to try and prevent this from happening and to try and protect members from our communities, but it‚Äôs just not possible to stop this kind of thing from happening to everyone, the only way that you can stop it from happening is for all of our members to change their user account settings from being able to receive unsolicited messages.

The exact same thing also applies to subs that are hidden from public view on here, creeps will eventually infiltrate these subs very quickly and easily, so these private subs are not a solution to the same problem.

So just to reiterate and to be very clear here, we have absolutely no connection or affiliation with this particular sub or any other sub for that matter and we are also not accountable or responsible for anything that goes wrong in regards to any of our sub community members here for anything that happens over there.

It‚Äôs also against the rules of this sub for anyone to make a post or a comment in this sub that either references, mentions or refers to this private sub and that also includes saying something in cryptic or coded language about that sub.  Anyone who I find doing that will have their post removed and they will also be permanently banned from this subreddit.

I have already permanently banned the owner of the private sub and all of the previous comments as well as permanently banned some users who shared the details of the private sub last week.

We are simply not going to allow others to signpost our members to somewhere else and put those members or ours at risk and in danger.

1hf9xar,post,navigating sexuality,"I haven‚Äôt been able to find anywhere to speak about this, so here goes i guess.

I had a brief relationship over the summer. A friend of a friend who lived a few hours drive away. I was very busy with work at the time so we never got to the point of physically meeting (thank god). 

It was okay at first. I was half a year out of EMDR and new meds, so I honestly felt really good! I was open and honest about my past and he was super nice about it. He made me feel safe and secure, we had a safe word set up, he was understanding of my refusal to do anything too graphic over the phone. I did everything right. I communicated, I was open, I was careful, and I promised myself i‚Äôd speak up right away. I did everything correct and it still got messed up somehow. 

Our conversations did occasionally get‚Ä¶ i don‚Äôt know, flirty. Risqu√© or whatever. I dreaded them every time and learned what not to say to avoid prompting the topic, but it didn‚Äôt always work. I should‚Äôve said stop here, but I just couldn‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt know why. I figured it was just some anxiety and that i needed to get over it. He wanted this picture of some specific clothes and it was fully clothed so i said yes. then as i was taking the picture i started crying. I felt so gross and so exposed and i didn‚Äôt want to do it anymore. Then i sent it anyway and i pretended it was fine. The relationship itself ended in an unrelated shitstorm and we decidedly do not talk anymore, but this stuck with me. 

i don‚Äôt know what to do with the fact that i couldn‚Äôt bring myself to say no, that i just froze and fawned. i thought i had healed beyond that you know? and i don‚Äôt know what to do if, god forbid, i end up in a physical situation like this. how am i supposed to trust myself to say no? i can‚Äôt let another person near if there‚Äôs a risk of this. i don‚Äôt know. i guess i feel really stupid and ashamed.

With dark intent for a terrible sin
He closed the car door with an audible lock
As he opened his mouth and began to talk

He spoke of things that didn‚Äôt sound right 
As we drove down the road in the cold sunlight
He fed me lies that he thought I‚Äôd believe
Although I was young he couldn‚Äôt deceive 

He drove to his house and pulled into the drive
As he came to a stop my heart started to dive
He promised of dogs that I‚Äôd never meet
I followed him in unaware of defeat

He guided me down the stairs in the dark 
The dogs upstairs giving an occasional bark
As if to warn me of what was to come
That terrible day when I became undone

He took from me what no child should lose
He didn‚Äôt give me the choice to refuse 
He used parts of my body where only love should grow
Leaving invisible scars that only I would know

The boy that left the house that day
Turned into a man who couldn‚Äôt escape
I built up walls afraid to get hurt
The friends I had I seemed to desert

I grew a second layer of skin
Made of shame and defeat that sits there in
Although that boy has come a long way

He had a rough life as a kid. I mean, I had a really f‚Äôing rough life as a kid and his was even worse. I would advise that you look deep in yourself and if you feel you even have the capacity of resenting or blaming the child for your life situation, that you please consider not raising the child yourself. No judgment if you self-reflect and recognize that this is possible, we are talking about the benefit of this potential child after all.

1hfapty,post,I have no confidence ,"A couple months ago, there was an incident where my now ex gf and I had just finished having sex. This was our first time having sex in a long time. I was very rusty and I guess she could visibly feel and sense that. It was very rocky and awkward because it had been so long. Pair that with the fact that our relationship wasn‚Äôt the healthiest. After we finished, we were watching a movie in my basement. It was very chill until she decided to reach over and try to grab my pe***. At first I kind of just asked ‚Äúwyd?‚Äù and kind of joked and laughed it off. Then a few minutes later she reached over but with more aggression and more strength. This made me very uncomfortable because I was not in the mood for that and we were just chilling watching a movie. I told her numerous times to stop and chill out but she persisted and kept asking ‚Äúwhy??‚Äù. In my head I was so confused and questioning wtf was going on. I had never seen her act like this before, ever. She kept grabbing at it for like 10 minutes and I had to physically restrain her and I put my hand over a pillow to block her from touching me. From that point on the rest of the night was just awkward and she ended up leaving shortly after. Would you guys consider this sexual assault? This whole situation changed the trajectory of our relationship and at the time I wasn‚Äôt honest about how it made me feel. I brushed it off and gave her the benefit of the doubt because she had been drinking. Later on in the year she did find out that I had been dishonest and disloyal in the relationship and she took it really bad which she had every right to. While i‚Äôm not blaming this incident on me being disloyal, I do feel like the situation completely drew me away from her and I found myself seeking things in other people. While I never physically did anything with anyone, I was entertaining the idea of it. I wish I had been honest about how I really felt and how much that incident affected me. What makes it even worse is that I have been sexually assaulted in the past back in 2019 and I told her about that situation and she knew every detail. For her to even try to do something like that made me question her and I was so confused. During the time of the incident I was so caught up with starting a new job, dealing with my own mental issues, and just wasn‚Äôt really confronting my feelings. I brushed it off and kind of pushed it to the side to try and hide it so that I didn‚Äôt have to face those demons from my past. Our relationship was completely shot. We barely hung out or spoke daily and she would prioritize her friends over me. It was so unhealthy. Then she found out about what I was doing and she completely lashed out and took it horribly. Now i‚Äôm here thinking about how what I did completely makes what she did feel nonexistent. It feels like she has completely forgotten about it and it hurts, but who am I to say anything cause I hurt her as well. Idk, I am in such a weird spot rn. I am so confused and have no confidence to do anything. Anyone have advice?",4,4.0,2024-12-16 04:03:14,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hfapty/i_have_no_confidence/

1hfawkp,post,Was this wrong ,"When I was 8 and in third grade my mom got this new bf Stan. Stan was nice for the most part to me and my older sister Alena 11 at the time. one day mom and Stan went out to eat and took us along after we got back it was late so my mom decided to let him stay the night for the first time. Me and my sister had a shower ritual. since we shared a room she would go first then I would wait for her so we could have girl talk in our towels weird but we were kids. Alena had just got out the bath and I was still drying off,when Stan burst through the door telling us it was time for bed. seeing we were naked he stared and said you girls are gonna be in trouble now. Alena ducked behind the bed screaming and I went to go get mom in my towel. i remember not knowing why I would be in trouble but simply accepting his word as fact. On the short walk to mom room Stan told me I better tell her before he dose that we were doing nasty stuff. I had no idea what he was talking about, but when I told my mom she told me to lock my door when I'm changing for now on. After that whenever stan was around he'd make off handed comments about my body or how I was pretty and growing nicely. Noone addressed theses comments so I didn't either. in the end they ended up breaking up when he threatened to kill my mom if she ever cheated talking about it vidly. That memory still bothers me to this day current age 14. and I just wanted to know if this counted as sa since he never touched me?",6,2.0,2024-12-16 04:14:03,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hfawkp/was_this_wrong/

In general, if someone tries to pry and make you describe graphic details like that, about Any traumatic experience, chances are they're doing so out of cruelty. Or they themself are gaining some sick joy of it. More ""normal"" questions would be focused on how you're doing after the event, like checking in on your mental/emotional state, asking if you need a hug or other form of comfort, asking about risk of lasting physical injury and how to get it treated, offering to support and back you up and speak out against the assaulter, or just generally offering company and a safe space to lean on them as you recover.

m2a9a7x,comment,,"A grown adult man should have simply seen that you, two children, were naked and getting dried/changed and left the room to give you privacy. While Stan didn't touch either of you, he did turn an otherwise harmless, if awkward, moment into a moment of shame and forced his sexual intent onto you and your sister.

This was very much a case of misconduct towards a pair of children. It is perfectly reasonable that it's stuck with you for this long. Having an adult invade your privacy and make uncomfortable remarks about your still developing body is a scary, stressful, very gross experience. It counts.",2,,2024-12-16 04:47:38,t3_1hfawkp,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hfawkp/was_this_wrong/m2a9a7x/
1hfbjsx,post,Was i sexually assaulted? ,"A month ago i had this guy over who i was just with for a two man. He asked if i was down for anything and i said yes thinking he was talking about just kissing. We were in my room cuddling while my best friend (Female) was next to us. He asks me if he wanted to leave my room to go look for something outside of my room and i said yes thinking thats what he meant. We sit down on the couch and were talking and he asked ‚Äúwhat do you want to do?‚Äù and i said ‚Äúidk‚Äù and he said ‚Äúwell (friends name) is right in that room so do u still wanna do anything‚Äù and i said yes thinking he just meant kissing. he kissed me and we were kissing for about 2 minutes and he tried to lift my shirt and i said ‚Äúuhm no im christian why would you try and do that?‚Äù and i was telling him about how im not comfortable with sexual stuff. he continued to say ‚Äúoh yeah my family is from (this country)‚Äù and then kissed me again. while we were kissing he was touching my boobs over my shirt even though i said no. Flight,fight, or freeze kicked in and i froze up and didnt tell him to stop because i didnt know what to do. i didnt give him consent to touch me there. After, i felt very uncomfortable so i kicked him out of my house. A couple people have told me its not sexual assualt cause its apart of kissing. Its hard for me too see if its sexual assault or not. I never gave him consent to touch me there. He never asked if that was okay or if he could do that. Even if it was apart of kissing, i wasnt comfortable at all.

m2ad1x7,comment,,"What happened to you was terrible, and it's horrid of the men responsible to carry on as they do having done that. It's common to doubt your memories and feel this way. As someone who also spirals and fixates and struggles to push the anger and hatred away, I personally turn towards my hobbies such as gaming and creative writing as an outlet for escapism. I like to vent through my stories by making characters who endure similar traumas but who have the power to make those who hurt them pay in full. It doesn't always work, because the knowledge of the real people who hurt me still being out there remains, but allowing a space to feel those emotions in full and vent them out and just let all that mess in the head come out is often very cathartic and helps keep it at a manageable level. At least for a time.

Community and friends can also be helpful! If you have, say, a local library, trying to make trips there once or twice a week just to hang on and chat can be a good way to build some connections and find people you can come to when times get really bad. Surrounding yourself with people who care for you and possibly even share similar experiences is invaluable in any recovery.

The thoughts may stay, but they needn't be so big and monstrous. It will come, it will go, it will ebb like the tides.

I got nervous (obviously) and told him im just going to go to sleep (downstairs) and left. He said he was going to join me and i was so tired (and high)  i didnt have the energy to tell him to go, but for some odd reason he kept asking me if he should be in here. He ended up leaving and i quickly locked the door (the door doesnt lock fully and i forgot) i shook this all off and layed down to gts. then i heard the door open. it was rlly late so i kinda froze (i was half asleep) and also turned over. he started moving closer to me and i started kinda shaking and he kept shaking me, and i just kinda knew. he started aggressively shaking me to see if i was up and i responded ‚Äúwhat, what are you doing‚Äù and he said ‚Äúnothing js go back to sleep‚Äù and i was still kinda dozing off when he said that. i thought if i ignored him hed leave me alone, but noo. he started asking me ‚Äú___ touch my d‚Äù over and over and i kept saying ‚Äúno im your little cousin‚Äù and he got mad. i ended up kinda dozing off (bc of the zaüçÉ idk it makes me sleepy) and i felt his hand glide all over me, i literally got chills. he kept touching me and i js froze (idk why i was scared) and he grabbed my face multiple times and tried to make me kiss him (ig to set a mood?) and i kept moving my face bc i was scared. I pretended to sleep so he could js leave me alone. and he seen that i closed my eyes and kept touching me. i turned over to idk..? make it more believable that im sleeping (i WISH my mom or anyone was up) and he started putting his body weight on me, and started to get ontop of me. i was genuinely scared so i said stop please, and he said ‚Äúoh uh‚Äù and js idk? pretended to leave. so when i thought he left (my dumbass like im never smoking again) i trusted myself enough to doze off frl, and he climbed back in bed with me? and i felt his body weight on me but i was genuinely dozing off and couldnt move. i was in a za comaüôèüèΩ but when i finally gained consciousness he was gone upstairs and idk what happened after that. my pelvis area has been hurting for awhile but i keep trying to brush it off. idk anymore, i cant even get a hug without feeling his hands all over me.

You do not need to feel disgusting or alone. There are a LOT of people who are equipped to handle this for you and help you process whatever happened.

1hff84e,post,TW: flashback of trauma during intimacy that I (27F) wasn‚Äôt aware of happened ,"About a year ago my now ex gf and I (27F) were having sex and I had what was and has since been one of the most distressing experiences I‚Äôve had. As a partner she always made me feel safe, and it was the closest I‚Äôve probably ever been with a partner. 

The scariest thing was that I had been fully present during and then all of a sudden I went somewhere else, freaked out, grabbed my gfs hand away from me and immediately burst into tears. I remember vague details of the flashback, some kind of blanket maybe? But it was mostly just the feeling. I‚Äôve not experienced that sort of terror before and that was also evident to her given my facial expression/reaction. After that I struggled to be intimate for a long while, even though I trusted her, anything like that would result in me feeling so distressed, it was like my inner child was trying to crawl out of my own body. 

I‚Äôve only ever had intimate relationships with women, and it generally takes me a little bit to feel fully comfortable being on the receiving end. It‚Äôs something I find extremely uncomfortable and a bit anxiety provoking, unless I feel safe being vulnerable in that way with my partner. 

I‚Äôm not really sure what I‚Äôm asking here, but I guess I want to know I‚Äôm not alone? And what I can expect next? We broke up for other reasons but this is something that weighs on my mind heavily in terms of dating again, what if it happens again? 

It‚Äôs also made me question my sexuality, I‚Äôve always found men attractive but always been confused between wanting to be them and the former. Mostly the thought of being with a man has been repulsive to me, but there is a part of me that‚Äôs curious, and also attracted to the idea of being intimate with a man, but now it seems like the repulsion is more a deep sense of distrust? Like I could never trust a man would be safe, to be able to be vulnerable in that sense with them? 

I don‚Äôt really know what I‚Äôm asking here, I just know I‚Äôm scared of the reality of why that happened. I‚Äôve never been sexually assaulted by a man and have always counted myself lucky, but now I‚Äôm not so sure if that‚Äôs true.

i‚Äôve even switched schools because i was so scared to see him in the hallways and because he kept following my car. 
i‚Äôm scared constantly and hyperventilate if i ever see him in public. it‚Äôs not too late to report the r*pe but im not sure i have enough evidence to say anything. i worry if there isn‚Äôt enough evidence and he gets acquitted then he‚Äôll try to kill me again. possibly succeed this time.

The brain is a mysterious place, you could have had an unknown trigger and it‚Äôs caused everything to pop up again. I still have flash backs from when I was 8 years old (I am 28 now).

Have you tried EMDR therapy? If you haven‚Äôt I highly recommend it. I am currently doing it at the moment for a violent R that happened to me in January overseas and it‚Äôs honestly saved my life. It‚Äôs a hard therapy but extremely effective. The person doing it needs to have the appropriate qualifications to do it though otherwise it can do more damage than good. It‚Äôs about reprocessing the memories so they aren‚Äôt as vivid and don‚Äôt live rent free in your head/bring back the feelings when you think of it. It is a lot easier to do on old traumas. 

In regards to therapists, it can take a few go‚Äôs to find the right one sometimes it‚Äôs not the therapist it‚Äôs actually us not opening up because it‚Äôs hard when it‚Äôs a severe trauma. I didn‚Äôt like my current therapist for a while, I thought she was too soft spoken, not tough enough with me, too gentle, thought the process was taking too long  etc but, I stuck with her and in the end I came to realise I was the problem and not her because I have a hard time opening up to people in general but I had this idealised version of what type of therapist I wanted which is not the type of therapist I actually needed.",1,,2024-12-16 12:22:45,t3_1hf9pzn,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hf9pzn/in_1996_i_was_raped_by_a_stranger_in_who_was/m2bhvui/

1hfhxjr,post,Massauce gave me a happy ending without my concent [33 M],"I \[33 M\] sometimes go to this completely legit thai massage place where i'm always paying a fixed rate after service with receit and proper cashier by card!, not by cash to the massauce.

Multiple times I've had my clothes removed for the massage so the bottocks area can be massaged which is good for me because I train my legs quite often and it's very stiff.

This time evertying went normally, but after about an hour the massauce started pulling away the tower from my bottocks and started massaging it with more oil applied sometimes touching the anus. I was a bit surprised, but it was pleasant, and I thought this massaur is just doing something differently than the others. She did not touch anything else apart from my bottocks area.

Then I was asked to turn around, and she half-removed the towel from me, and started massagin my thighs then almost completely removed the towel it was basically just half-on 1 of my legs. She did a couple of passes around my crotch where she barely touched my penis which gave me an erection. Then she touched my penis a couple of times maybe 3-4 times with sweeping motion from top to bottom and before I could come to my senses she had put her hand around it and immediately I had an orgasm. When I came to my senses I felt incredibly ashamed and had no idea what to do. I then asked to end the massage early as I still had 15 minutes left.

I left the place in a hurry wishing I could have vanished from there right away.

I have never been feeling more humiliated or ashamed in my entire life. I'm legitimally disgusted of myself. I have a wife who I love very much, and I never had the faintest idea of cheating on her by any means. I'm very loyal, we have been together for 12 years, there is complete honesty between us.

I basically can't think of anything else ever since the event. Also I have incredible guilt, as I feel that I could have stopped this from happening. I Should have started suspecting something during the bottocks massage, so I had a good 5 minutes to realize what direction this was going. After that my body was basically just obeying what she asked, and my mind felt disconnected. I lost all power and control. Frozen. Just laying there and letting her do whaterver she did.

I immediately told my wife and to my surprise she was completely supportive. Asked me whether I said / did anything that could have implied this, whether I was asked of anything. But nothing. Basically the massause just slowly progressed a normal thai massage into an erotic massage to her liking. My wife's opinion is that I was sexually harassed.

Howerer the worst of it, that I feel it's basically 100% on me, as I'm the one who have let this happen. I had several chances and a good 5-6 minutes to stop this but I did not. Even so because among my sexual fantasies this kind of thing was always present, but it was a vague fantasy which was exciting and it was just mine. Just for me. This also makes me feel like I have did this to myself by gravitating this event towards me and that I actually wanted this to happen.

In the last year due to personal issues i'm also suffering from chronic stress and long-term sleep deprivation, which might have contributed to my inability to act, but this might just be something that i'm trying to use to justify myself, or reduce my guilt...",7,3.0,2024-12-16 12:23:42,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hfhxjr/massauce_gave_me_a_happy_ending_without_my/

m2bmy3z,comment,,"Hi, so this wasn't your fault at all. It's very very common for survivors to take the blame and feel guilty, but the guilt isn't yours to carry. The reason that you didn't stop the buttocks massage is because you quite reasonably didn't think that she meant it in a sexual way. It's actually very normal to think 'ok I've never experienced this before but she's a professional, I'm sure she knows what she's doing'. You weren't in a sexual context, therefore of course you didn't expect anything sexual to happen. Furthermore, the fact that you didn't stop it doesn't mean you consented. You froze. That's a normal response to sexual assault - freezing, disassociating, not being able to stop it. I'm really sorry this happened to you, and I'd report that woman if you can.",3,,2024-12-16 13:02:53,t3_1hfhxjr,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hfhxjr/massauce_gave_me_a_happy_ending_without_my/m2bmy3z/

1hfimni,post,was this sa? im confused ,"basically when i (22 f)was 18 i went into a mental hospital for the first time. i became friends with my roommate (23f at the time). we started hanging out outside the hospital when we were both released 

i remember one day it was 3am and we were both pretty drunk and were sending naughty pics to her baby dad (42m at the time). we ended up going to his apartment and had a threesome

this happened i think three times, and every time i was under the influence while they werent

i know everything leading up to this wasnt sa because i consented but heres where i get confused: 

i remember one of the times i told my friend i didnt want her baby dad to do anything to me during the threesome. she said that he wouldnt. but i dont think she actually talked to him because while it was happening he started to rub my downstairs area with his fingers. i didn‚Äôt know what to do. i felt paralyzed and couldn‚Äôt get myself to move or say anything, but i dont know if it was sa

any clarity on this would be very helpful, thank you",3,4.0,2024-12-16 13:04:27,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hfimni/was_this_sa_im_confused/

1hfkq3p,post,I don‚Äôt know if I was assaulted or not,"My works Christmas party was two days ago, we were all really drunk / on drugs. I had got an uber back to where I was staying with two other colleagues as they wanted to make sure I got home safe.

I sat in the back of the uber with a colleague (he‚Äôs almost 40, I‚Äôm mid 20s). I was really out of it, I had drank and taken drugs. I trusted this colleague as we get on well, he always goes on about how he wants to look after the women he works with. He made me sit next to him in the back and pulled me closed to him and started putting his hands above my underwear and touching me. I was really out of it and falling asleep. 

I got my other colleague to get in the back and sit next to me so I felt safe and he stopped.

I can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm being dramatic about this. I can‚Äôt stop blaming myself and telling myself that I was very drunk and I shouldn‚Äôt have been in that state anyway and if I wasn‚Äôt then maybe this wouldn‚Äôt have happened

1hfniho,post,Was i raped? ,"My friend and I were talking recently and he was mentioning that his bf is upset they barely have sex. I told him it's weird if someone keeps insisting sex and that it shouldn't be that way but he said that it had been months and his man wasn't being weird or insistent about it. I told him good that I was previously with a man who wanted sex everytime we were together, at night when we woke up etc. To the point where one time i didn't wanna sleep over after a date and asked him to take me home bc i was tired so he sped to my house and didn't talk to me the whole ride. I told him bye he barely looked at me then without a kiss said bye. I got out and right when i closed the car door he sped off and i was left standing on the street. We talked it out he apologized so i didn't think it was that bad. Months later we went to his friends bday party and i got super drunk & i was throwing up in the bathroom and in the car on the way home. I was feeling awful but he was caring for me and being really kind about it so when we got home i brushed my teeth and went right to his bed. He immediately started touching up on me. I was going along w it but i was so tired and still drunk. We start having sex and i passed out and don't even remember going to bed. He tells me the next day about it and im like ""wow i barely remember that."" He was like yeah i was trying to do anal but it wasn't working. And i was like that's weird i definitely don't remember that....and he's like ""oh really?"" Kind of just being like ""how come you don't remember""... After i mentioned this my friend said that that was rape but i just brushed it off. I mentioned it to my boyfriend after bc i was thinking maybe my friend was just overreacting but he said that it was rape and that him insisting and getting upset i didn't want it was also rape. Now i can't stop feeling weird and anxious. I keep remembering how he would insist and even when i was tired and just waking up i would literally just lay there so he could finish and go back to sleep. I thought it was normal to have a healthy amount of sex in relationships and honestly i sometimes felt unwanted if someone wasn't always wanting it. I think i might have a weird relationship w sex but i also haven't been in many relationships so it was just something that didn't seem so violent or rape like to make me think that. My bf now is so kind about it i told him he makes me feel like if we don't have sex we'd still be together. That it's not such a big deal with us like other men have made me feel. I can't stop thinking about this it's been a whole day and i still feel like anxious and my body is tense especially my throat. I keep thinking about other things that happened w that dude and how he didn't care if i didn't really want it he'd be like ""you don't have to do anything just lay there""... and i would. I got so high one time and he took photos after we had sex of me passed out and i barely remember that either.... but to be fair i was really high. Idk what to do i can't stop feeling weird like im on the verge of crying and it's like a weight on me now. It's it normal or am i overreacting... either way how do i stop feeling like this?

1hfnsqa,post,Am I currently being groomed?,"Yesterday, on my main acc, I was DM'd by a random person asking me about my favorite video game. The conversation did not start off weird at all, and we just talked about completely normal things for a bit until he asked for my discord.

Things got a bit weird from here, he claimed he was 18 while I was 15, I don't know if it's normal for an 18yr to be friends with a 15yr but the things he was talking to me about didn't seem okay for some random adult to be talking to a minor about.

He sent me pictures of his girlfriend and asked if I thought she was pretty and was my type. I said yes but explained that I hadn't ever felt romantic attraction to anyone before, which is true. He then started asking me increasingly weirder stuff, like if I was a boobs or butt person, if I masturbate and if so how much, and making jokes about how I probably liked the pictures of his girlfriend that were more revealing, which made me uncomfortable, but I was too afraid to say anything.

This guy was really nice, I don't have many friends and my parents are abusive and neglectful so despite me feeling uncomfortable I was oddly comforted by the kindness and didn't immediately block him, he even eventually got me to talk about some of my trauma growing up, and comforted me through that as well.

He then sent me a picture of his girlfriend once again, but this time it was a butt pic, not just a slightly revealing outfit like he had sent me before. This was weird as hell in my opinion, and I told him I was going to sleep and we would talk tomorrow.

Part of me feels like I'm not being groomed and that I'm simply overreacting, but at the same time I don't think this is normal for an 18yr to be doing to a minor, even if he only just became an adult. I also feel guilty for not having blocked him yet, but at the same time he's really nice and I only want to cut him out if I'm actually being groomed.

Can I please have some advice.",2,3.0,2024-12-16 17:04:39,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hfnsqa/am_i_currently_being_groomed/

1hfokw2,post,Can‚Äôt get over ex,"It‚Äôs been five weeks I‚Äôm still not over him, I miss him yet I‚Äôm lying awake at night in tears for what he did to me. I‚Äôm 19, still living with my parents closeted bisexual and asexual. He held me down and dryhumped me in my own home knowing my parents would be gone for three days and played it off as a joke when I was hitting him and trying to push him off me in tears. Earlier before this happened he grabbed me while we were kissing and forced me to French him despite me telling him the day before I would never be comfortable with it. He tried to force me to stop being asexual and gay, told me I burn in hell. Told me my only purpose was to have his children and take care of his house in the future. He wanted me to transfer colleges to be with him despite his being too expensive and having bad art programs. He would tell me we would have sex every night whether I liked it or not once we were married, I‚Äôm afraid that if he didn‚Äôt think premarital sex was a sin he would‚Äôve r worded me. He saw me in the halls in hs 2 years before we met and already had our whole lives planned out and refused to change anything, I felt more like his personal sex doll than a person (despite never having sex with him), he never really listened to me talking about my hyper-fixations and would never talk to me about his interests, I would be talking and he would grab my head and force me to kiss him. He would guilt me for being uncomfortable with him pinching my flab, I am not obese but have a little belly fat cause I struggle to lose weight due to genetics and not knowing healthy eating habits as a kid. If I turned away when he was trying to kiss me he would grab my chin and grip it to the point and hurt and force me to. When his friends were around he would hold me infront of him ignoring me telling him to stop and knee my butt as if he was fucking me. He though he could force me to stop having body insecurities and be comfortable with everything he wants to do, he thought he was higher than everyone else cause he was my bf and could ignore my boundaries and consent. He held me down onto the couch once and took my watch and phone so I couldn‚Äôt keep track of the time and wouldn‚Äôt let me leave until past my curfew and still held me down after my alarm went off to leave. He didn‚Äôt care that I was punished for this and I knew my parents wouldn‚Äôt believe if I explained this to them cause they see me as a child that makes up excuses and lies they also don‚Äôt know any of this except for him pinching my flab, being obsessed with me before we met, and that he wanted to marry me after 4 months. He was joking but once he held my head in place and forced me to watch the sex scene in Lost Boys with him knowing I wasn‚Äôt comfortable with it due to me waking up to my roommate having sex in our dorm while I was sleeping the week before cause I sleep scrunched into a ball with the covers covering my head and her toxic ex convinced her I left the room several hours ago, she regrets not checking the bed before hand but wanted to respect my privacy by not touching my side of the room. He also knew even before this incident watching or hearing sex on tv or even the though of it made me very uncomfortable despite years of building up a tolerance to it since so many shows and movies I like nowadays have sex scenes. He would always defend himself saying ‚Äúit was just a joke‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm trying to progress our relationship‚Äù ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know you felt that way‚Äù (despite me hitting him yelling him to stop and get off me) ‚ÄúI can change‚Äù (we talked about this twice and both times it got worse) ‚ÄúI just want you to be happy you come first‚Äù (your trying to force me to play the part of your conservative romance fantasy, he tried to force me to become more conservative religiously (we‚Äôre the same religion) and tried to force me to change political parties for him) I havnt filed and sa report cause he knows where I live and im afraid he‚Äôll out me to my homophobic mother.",1,3.0,2024-12-16 17:37:44,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hfokw2/cant_get_over_ex/

For one, I have a text message from him that I got after I confronted him about assaulting me. he said ‚Äúno, I wasn‚Äôt super clear what you were comfortable versus uncomfortable with.‚Äù which is a confession imo. I have evidence that I went to a sexual assault support group this year. I also have two strong witnesses. 

This is all so crazy, but he deserves to be held accountable.

1hfsth4,post,I'm afraid of boys/men ,"Hi! I'm a 14 year old girl and as I've grown older I've come to fear boys/men. I was molested twice as a child and Almost raped when I grew up and told my Mother's side of the family but they said and I quote 'your uncles were probably drunk and it was a long time ago. Don't tell your father or anyone else about this'. I was 12 when I told them... 

I never told my mother's family that I was almost raped by a cousin of mine on my fathers side because I knew they would forget about the fact my uncles molested me and put pressure on my cousin because he isn't on my mother's side of the family. 

When I was almost raped (thank god it didn't happen) my cousins mother stepped in and stopped him, she reprimanded him and told me not to tell anyone what happened , I was 6 at the time so of course I listened because I didn't understand what happened. 

All of this combined with the number of times I've been cat called on the streets by old men, had inappropriate phrases said to me by fellow classmates and sometimes having weird men staring at me or my friends when we're at the mall- I've started avoiding the male gender out of fear of being sexually harassed, I'm afraid of going out and I lock myself up in my room all the time. I've stopped going to school and my single father even though he has no idea what is going on with me is being supportive, I'm applying to an all girls school next year but I have to repeat the grade . 

My fear is really affecting my life and I have no idea how to fix myself without my dad knowing... I need advice. ",4,7.0,2024-12-16 20:35:27,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hfsth4/im_afraid_of_boysmen/

m2e23qr,comment,,You bring up a really important point and I'm hoping everybody else will chime in. What I would recommend would be a few things that would help you feel safe in general. One is there are a number of pop psychology self-help type books out there on developing assertiveness which would be helpful so that you feel confident telling guys that cat call you on the street to go right to hell. Another category of pop psychology self-help books to get out of the library is anything along the lines of how to identified people who are really dangerous and who are sociopaths. Knowing ways to definitely identify dangerous people will help. I would also recommend when you get the opportunity learning self defense something like Jiu-Jitsu or judo is good for women since it doesn't rely on brute strength or your punching ability.,1,,2024-12-16 21:07:35,t3_1hfsth4,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hfsth4/im_afraid_of_boysmen/m2e23qr/

1hftu2n,post,"If you remember SA in the future, it still won't have been your fault.","A little over 12 years ago, I was assaulted by the same person twice. Was it the same night? I don't remember. But it was in the same building, after being reassured my friend's boyfriend wouldn't be around. 

The first time was in an empty stairwell. I was wearing baggy sweatpants and an oversized sweater. I don't ever want to hear ""well what was she wearing"" as an excuse. I had just lost my virginity a few months prior. I was in a relationship when it happened, and the person I was with said ""oh well, we'll get over it"" very nonchalantly.

The second time, I'd fallen asleep on the living room floor of someone I thought I could trust. I don't remember if it was the same day. When I woke up, the nightmare began.

 What was I wearing? It doesn't matter. I could have been wearing a dress, a nightgown, or a tank top and underwear. I could have been wearing a jumpsuit, a skirt, or anything else for that matter. Baggy pants didn't stop him the first time, no other clothing item would have the second. Little did I know, how traumatizing the second time would turn out to be. 

For years, I screamed in my sleep after that. For years, I drank away the pain after that.

Searching for healing, I left town. I joined and escaped more than one commercial cult after that. A distraction, of sorts.

I don't recommend it.

My friend claimed her boyfriend had a daughter at the time. No one could find out about what he did. 

I never reported it. I never told anyone.

12 and a half years ago, I had plans.

I'd go to school, work hard to establish a career, get married, have babies.  I was so focused on not destroying anyone else's life, I disregarded my own. 

His actions had horrific ripple effects more than a decade later. Involuntary flashbacks, C-PTSD I'm saving you the details of. 

***If you read this and you've been through anything like this, I'm sorry. I'm with you in solidarity.

****If you read this and are at a place where you question if you'll ever raise a family, support yourself financially, or have a flashback free life, I'm with you in solidarity. 

**If you read this and just see some old wench who had ""bad sex"" and can't get over it, may your extended family live trauma-free lives, and may every person who you hurt respond to you with unbridled wisdom and strength. May your life be what it needs to be.",9,3.0,2024-12-16 21:17:52,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hftu2n/if_you_remember_sa_in_the_future_it_still_wont/

1hfu0sx,post,How do I speak with my friend about what happened to her? ,"One of my best friends has this sexual experience she's spoken with me about which makes me super uncomfortable. She insists it was fully consensual, but she basically slept with a guy who was 100% sober while she was very, VERY drunk and he knew it. She literally texted him that she was drunk before she came over to his house, and while she was there he gave her like 2 glasses of wine and didn't drink any alcohol himself. The whole situation makes me really uncomfortable and feel a bit squirmy inside. 

The problem is that I've already raised to her the fact that this guy is a creep as she didn't have the capacity to consent, and she reassured me that everything really and truly was fine. I don't want to force the issue and insist she's traumatised when she's not, but also I can't stand the idea of someone who would sleep with a super drunk person while stone cold sober getting off scott free. I also can't figure out if I'm being overdramatic about this situation (I tend to be very obsessive about consent as I have OCD in this topic, and any sexual situation which isn't 1000% verbally confirmed at every stage, VERY enthusiastic, and given between two sober adults tends to trigger me). Could someone tell me what they'd do in this situation, and if they think I'm overreacting b/c of my trauma?

m2e7oss,comment,,"Not rude at all. If the counsellor is worth their salt, they won't take it personally at all - some people just don't click with specific therapy techniques, and that's ok, not a reflection of you and not a reflection of them (unless you feel they're acting in genuinely bad/neglectful ways). You can definitely ask to change counsellor! Just a heads up that changing counsellor might mean that it might take you a little bit longer to get more counselling sessions as it might take a while to fit you into a new timetable. I would say it would be a good idea to change counsellor though if you don't feel it's clicking.

1hfum91,post,I have an issue with people hugging me from behind b/c of trauma- what to do about it? ,"Most of my trauma symptoms come in regard to people touching me in private places. Honestly, I can deal with this because I've become very good at expressing my boundaries to sexual partners before any sex happens, meaning that I know they won't touch me there. However, I have one trauma symptom which makes me really really sad, and I haven't actually told anyone about it as I don't want to have it, so I thought if I just pretended I didn't have it everything would be ok. But I have it, and it's not going away. 

Basically when I was assaulted, I was assaulted from behind (people sneaking up on me), meaning that I find people hugging me from behind a bit triggering. I feel instantly anxious, freeze a little bit, and generally feel shit for a while afterwards. I am famous for loving hugs (I'm a super huggy person) and have never told anyone this trigger, so a lot of my friends will give me hugs from behind, which they reasonable assume that I like because i'll lean my head against them/ chat happily/ appear to remain calm and enjoy it. But actually I hate it the whole time and it makes me feel sick. I feel genuinely so sad and upset about this trauma symptom. I wish i didn't have it, I love hugs usually. But my friend hugged me from behind yesterday and it really stressed me out, and I realised that I actually need to bring it up/ do something about it. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to get more comfortable with triggering stuff that you want to do? It feels weird and icky and disgusting to tell my friends that a non-sexual and loving act of affection that they do actually triggers sexual trauma for me. I know it would make them feel really awful and guilty, and it's not their fault at all and they haven't done anything wrong. Plus, I really used to love hugs from behind - someone surprising you with a gesture of physical affection used to feel wonderful to me, and I hate the fact that it's gone from me because of something that happened outside of my control. So I feel really angry about having to let something go that I used to enjoy. It's weird, but the idea of giving up hugs (especially from behind) upsets me wayyyy more than sexual partners not being able to touch my private parts. Sorry, bit of a rant, but if anyone has any advice/similar experiences, it would be great to hear.

An important part of consent is the question of whether someone has the capacity to consent. This man preyed on two INCREDIBLY vulnerable women - you had literally only just been released from hospital. He was significantly older than both of you. Furthermore, you said you were 'under the influence' every single time you went to this man's house. For me, that adds up to you not having capacity to consent.

1hfvfqh,post,I can't sleep at home anymore,"So I live at home with my parents. I'm still college so this is comoletely normal, I  cant move out (i live in an asian country so its not even an option). It started at around a few years ago when my younger brother would sleep next to me when I was asleep and start groping me. It started small . Just a hand under my shirt, just touching. It then escalated to him completely  stripping me and rubbing himself  against me. It only happened when my parents werent at home and I was asleep so I  stopped sleeping when my parents weren't at home. I was honestly terrified  cause I couldn't  confront him and I couldn't  tell anyone because it would absolutely kill my  parents. He then went off to college in a different state so it felt like I was finally free. But he came home for vacation and now its gotten worse to the point where he does it when my parents are at home in the middle of the night when everyones sleeping. He now completely strips me and rubs against me and tries to make out. I tried a few days to not even sleep at night or atleast sleep after he goes to bed which results in me getting only two to three hours of sleep but I fell asleep again today and it happened again. I'm  scared. And I feel unsafe in my own home even with my parents in the next room. I'm terrified even when I  smell his deodorant, like his smell is imbedded in my head. I cant tell anyone ever because it would ruin my entire family and I  can't  ever do that to my parents. And I  can't  talk about this to anyone. So here I am on reddit just ranting it out. He goes back in a week but I honestly don't  know how im going to sleep till then but most importantly I'm terrified for the 2 month summer break he'll be back for.",2,3.0,2024-12-16 22:26:00,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hfvfqh/i_cant_sleep_at_home_anymore/

m2eityq,comment,,Martial arts learned alone can be difficult. But get a hang of the basics you could do tai chi learned at home. It's a slow motion way to learn a lot of the defensive martial arts moves. It's an exercise and if you poke around on YouTube you will find some people using it as a competitive martial art that will make you feel as though it's worth learning. If you get the opportunity I would also recommend krav maga. It's very effective for people to defend themselves in very fast very dangerous situations and it's fairly easy to learn. I'll try to remember some good books on assertiveness training and on how to recognize people with dark triad sociopath traits. It's been about a decade since I really did a deep dive on that to help teach my own kids.

I've told myself that it wasn't sexual assault but lately I've been thinking other things. He made me suck him and then proceeded to touch me and kiss me. Then, he told me if I told anyone, that he would tell them that I did something bad. I was 6. I've tried to tell myself that it was just a dream, but what kind of dream do you remember vividly for 10 years. Also, what 6 year old can dream that, when they don't even know what that is. Lately, I've been contemplating telling my parents about this, but it was so long ago and I feel like it may not even be worth it because me and him have an okay relationship now. What if no one believes me. I feel guilty for some reason. I believe that this may have caused some developmental problems within my life.

1hfxf01,post,Worrying over early dynamic in long term relationship (TW SA) ,"TLDR: my boyfriend used to playfully try and get me in the mood after I said no. 

I have ocd over sexual boundaries and assault since I was SA‚Äôd by a stranger about 3 months into my relationship with my current boyfriend of 4 years. 

Before this happened to me, there were a couple of times where my boyfriend would do this thing where he would try and gently get me in the mood after I‚Äôd indicated no. 

We had very few boundaries early on and (TMI) were usually naked and having a lot of sex. 

The most obvious example of the behaviour I‚Äôm talking about was one morning when we were cuddling nude after we‚Äôd just woken up and my boyfriend began lightly stroking me down there. I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still sleepy baby‚Äù and he  cuddled me, then carried on gently touching me in the same place. I laughed and said ‚Äúhaha not right now‚Äù and he stopped. 

This kind of thing would happen a couple of times, verging from that kind of behaviour to a kiss or boob stroke after I‚Äôd said no. We would do this all morning, with my sometimes reciprocating for a few minutes and then stopping etc until I felt in the mood and I would properly initiate sex. 

I didn‚Äôt feel uncomfortable or think about it at all at the time, I think I have a vague memory of once feeling mild irritation at it. After the assault this kind of thing didn‚Äôt carry on except for once when I got upset (by this point my ocd had latched onto the theme of consent) and after that he realised by boundaries had changed and didn‚Äôt ever do it again. 

I‚Äôve read nothing online that says this kind of thing is okay - everything says it‚Äôs coercion and worse, constitutes sexual assault. My friends in relationships have said similar playful ‚Äúgetting in the mood‚Äù behaviour occurs and they don‚Äôt mind it. 

Please help me, if this is abuse then I don‚Äôt know what to do. ",2,2.0,2024-12-16 23:55:56,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hfxf01/worrying_over_early_dynamic_in_long_term/

1hfybgq,post,"Feeling so stupid/embarrassed for going back to him and he did it again (shocker, I know)","A while ago, I got with this guy who ended up being rather coercive and ended up taking things way further than I'd wanted while talking nicely to me the whole time. It was so confusing. It took me a while to register that it was rape. I'd always convinced myself that I just hadn't communicated well enough (even though I told him I wanted to stop multiple times and he just begged to keep going) or that he didn't know what he was doing. Part of me still believes this for some reason

He texted me the other day asking if I was around. Between agreeing and actually seeing him, I fully convinced myself that it wouldn't be as bad as the first time and that I'd do a better job at communicating or that the first time was just in my head and that he was actually a nice guy. Lo and behold he still isn't. It went down in a very similar way as the first time.

I told a friend about the first time it happened, but I'm too embarrassed to tell anyone because it was literally the same guy. How could I have been so stupid?? I feel used beyond belief, but also that I deserve it in a way for trusting him yet again, or convincing myself that he's actually a nice guy.

I just wrote in my journal about it, but I want to tell someone. So I guess here it is. The fact that it was literally the same guy is one of the worst parts for me. If he were different, then I could just say ""oh well I didn't know he was like that.""",2,1.0,2024-12-17 00:38:44,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hfybgq/feeling_so_stupidembarrassed_for_going_back_to/

1hfycaa,post,Was this oral SA?,"For context, I‚Äôm a teen. Over the summer me and this one guy both liked each other and we eventually started talking. I‚Äôve known him for around 10 years and I‚Äôve always kinda liked him and when we started talking I was so happy. Later into summer we were texting and I told him I was planning to go to the pool later with a bunch of my friends, and invited him to come with me. I don‚Äôt even know how this conversation started, but he basically asked me for head. In the past I know he‚Äòs had sex before and has done stuff with women but it‚Äôs never really bothered me. When he asked me for head I kind of freaked out because it was kind of like an ultimatum cause I know he‚Äôs left girls before because they didn‚Äôt wanna do shit with him and I really didn‚Äôt wanna lose him so I said yes, thinking that when I hung out with him I could just leave a little early or maybe he would forget. (Stupid, I know.). But basically when we were hanging out he kept insisting that we just go to the family bathroom or something, and I didn‚Äôt know what to do and I was kind of scared of saying no so I just agreed thinking ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just make out with him and then say I have to go.‚Äù, but then he just kept insisting that I give him head, saying things like ‚ÄúOh cmon, you already agreed.‚Äù, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be quick.‚Äù, ‚ÄúYou already got my hopes up.‚Äù, and other shit like that. I kept telling him I had to go, or that I didn‚Äôt have the time but then he took his pants off and started like pushing my head towards it (I was sitting on a bench thingy and he was standing infront of me) (also sorry if this is TMI) but eventually I just kinda gave in and yk. After a few minutes I just kind of freaked out again and told him that I had to go because I had a family thing later, or some bullshit like that, and just left. I had also sent ‚Äòpics‚Äô to him before we hung out because he had kept asking for them and he saved them. A few days after we had hung out a few of my friends told me that he was going around telling people that he had ‚Äòpictures‚Äô of me. I texted him and I asked him why he was telling people that and why he would do that to me and I was begging him not to leak me and he kept comforting me saying shit like ‚ÄúI would never leak you‚Äù ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the sweetest person ever I would never do that to you‚Äù. I believe him because he also told me that he deleted the photos but then I found out he was sending them to people, showing them to people off his phone, and telling people I gave him head. I confronted him again and he denied showing anybody anything and told me that he just told people about it and that I was being dramatic. I also told him to not tell people about how I gave him head because I didn‚Äôt really want to in the first place and he said ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre acting like I raped you or something, you literally agreed to it before‚Äù. After that, I kinda just gave up trying to talk to him about it and just stopped caring because I was just fed up.
I cut him out of my life and haven‚Äôt talked to him in months, but everybody that I‚Äôve talked to about this says that it wasn‚Äôt SA because technically I agreed to it, I could‚Äôve just told him no and stopped that before it had gone further, and that it didn‚Äôt count as SA because we‚Äôre the same age. 
I‚Äôm really ashamed of this and I‚Äôm so disappointed with myself for doing stuff like this at that age but I just want to know what other people think.
Sorry again if this is TMI! This is my first time posting on reddit

1hg0gxg,post,Was I sexually assaulted as a child by my friend? Warning both minors at the time (couldn't add two flairs),"I (19ftm) was about 8 or 9 when my childhood friend ""Henry"" (M same age) asked me to do stuff with him while I was over at his house. The memory is so blurry I can't remember what he asked exactly. But I remember him blocking his door so his parents couldn't walk in. I didn't notice the red flag there and agreed. But I don't remember if I enthusiastically agreed and encouraged it. 

At first I was okay with it I guess but when he started to touch me (our clothes off at this point) and go to take pictures of my private parts (on his 3DS embarrassing to admit) it felt so wrong. I was so uncomfortable but I couldn't speak up and say no. I think it was out of fear as I struggled to say no to people (for context I had been through child abuse previously to this till I was 6 so I was always scared to speak up). I didn't want to make him upset or angry so I stayed quiet. I think he made me touch him too but I can't remember that properly if so. 

The second time he tried this was at my house and wanted me to go all the way and have sex with him. This time I somehow found the courage to say no and he got so angry with me. 

I have a memory of confessing to my mum (not sure what age but no older than 11) and she just brushed it off so maybe I made that memory up. I doubt every time I think about this all which is multiple times a week at a minimum. 
I hadn't seen ""Henry"" in years since we were about 11 but then I saw him at my college I used to go to and I freaked out so uncomfortable and almost like I couldn't move. I don't think he recognised me. But I heard from multiple girls that he has SAed multiple girls. Did I possibly traumatise him by agreeing to do stuff the first time? (I never remember saying yes but I have a feeling I did as I have no memory of saying no or fighting back) 
A similar situation happened with a another friend ""Allen"" (M about 2 and a half years younger). He wanted to play a game and I didn't say no. He tried to penetrate me but wasn't able to so stopped and just touched instead. I feel disgusting for allowing this to happen and possibly traumatising him as I'm older so I should've known better. I can't remember if this happened before or after what happened with ""Henry"". 

Ever since all of this I had a bad addiction to porn as a child. I think ""Henry"" had showed me a video but I can't guarantee that that isn't a made up memory because it's too foggy.

In conclusion, was I sexually assaulted or did I do something bad?

I‚Äôve seen telltale signs that a child has been abused, and I‚Äôm ticking boxes left and right, but I know some of those symptoms could have been caused by other things. 
I‚Äôve dealt with other childhood trauma, and spent a lot of time in this timeframe with my biological mother, who has been known to hang around shitty drug addict people, and who already did inappropriate things to another minor.

I left because I was mentally drained and she sexually assaulted me multiple times, and worse (things that I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm comfortable sharing yet). 

Anyways, my old best friend (who dated her before me, he set us up together for homecoming and we started dating). I told him what happened, and he said that she probably didn‚Äôt mean it, and that we don‚Äôt know what she was thinking at the time (of the assaults). My assaulter has also told him that she always cared. I looked back through our messages and she never sounded horribly mean all of the time, only sometimes she sounded harsh. Other times she sounded like any normal partner would. It confuses the hell out of me. And she would say how much she loved and cared about me. 

This is driving me insane. Did she actually care about me and did she really not mean to hurt me? Or was she a cold heartless bastard like I‚Äôve been thinking she is?

1hg4w73,post,It's winter break and I (14F) have to go by the bar again.  I have other old posts so I don't have to repeat everything.,"Hey not sure what to really say.  I made some posts a couple months ago and it's been ok since then bc I been in school and haven't had to sit for my sister too much.  I did it last a little after Halloween and some stuff did happn but not bad like before.  I'm going on break now tho and I kno I'm going to help my sister out during it.  

I did text my friend who is the guy at the bar I can really trust.  He just wants me to come by next time and talk like we used to which that Im ok with.  And he said the one guy who was more the one who did stuff or got other guys to do stuff that he isn't there as much and it's better now.

And I kno everyone will just say like don't talk to him but when I walk by and he's there, it's hard to just be rude and ignore him.  Especally since he's the one who helped me most when it happnd.

Sorry if this doesn't make sense.  But just if someone sees this and can maybe talk to me that would help a lot.  Thx!",1,1.0,2024-12-17 06:46:59,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hg4w73/its_winter_break_and_i_14f_have_to_go_by_the_bar/

I wish I could just consume all the bad and process it all so no one would have to experience such trauma and it be completely eliminated from the world all together.

But I‚Äôve thought about the why me and others before. And I honestly think it just comes down to a person deciding to do a very bad thing and we are just there in the cross fire. 

I do believe something happened to my grandpa as well. Something that made him feel so powerless he turned to taking instead of healing.

I‚Äôm so sorry you remember everything so clearly. I think about maybe trying to remember later on in life so the little me doesn‚Äôt experience it all alone because I feel stronger now.

1hg5sd5,post,weird sexual history with stuff bordering on abuse. what happened to me? is this normal?,"i (F20) always think about my weird history with sex. i never know if it was abuse from my dad or one girl or if it‚Äôs bad or normal. this is a long one. thanks for reading if you get through it. 

TLDR: my dad said lots of weird shit about sex to me as a kid. then i had sexual interactions with many other kids as a kid and the first one of them was pretty traumatic because i didn‚Äôt want to do it, i just felt like i should. then after that i started doing it and liking it and became very hypersexual. now i fluctuate between sex repulsed and hypersexual. i also struggle a lot to speak up for my needs in bed or even knowing what i want or need in the first place, and have put myself in uncomfortable situations due to this. i don‚Äôt know if this classifies as abuse or not. i don‚Äôt know why my relationship with sex has always been so messed up, i feel like my dad did weird stuff but maybe nothing that really qualifies as abuse?

i think it all started with my dad. he never did anything to actually touch me that i remember. but i know he‚Äôs always been very strange sexually and it‚Äôs weird that i even know that as his daughter. for example:
- when i was 8 or 9, i said i didn‚Äôt feel as pretty as girls on my soccer team. my sister was there and she expressed the same feeling, not feeling pretty. my dad said, ‚Äúwhatever they have, you both have it too.‚Äù and we asked him what ‚Äúit‚Äù was. he said, ‚Äúsex appeal.‚Äù we were 8 or 9 and 14 or 15 then. 

-he also had a ‚Äúchristmas tradition‚Äù where he‚Äôd make a show of placing the angel on top of the christmas tree, making weird, pained noises pretending to be the angel, like she was getting something stuck in her butt. we did this every year when i was a kid and when i was 11 i expressed that i thought it was gross and asked him not to do it anymore. he got really upset then. 

-my sister told me that he told her as a kid that she‚Äôd be a ‚Äúsex kitten‚Äù when she grew up. 

-one time when i was a kid, i expressed that i was insecure about a mole on my shoulder. he said one of his students (he‚Äôs a college professor) had a mole on her shoulder and it ‚Äúdrove him crazy‚Äù and its fine to have a mole there because men like it. 

-when my parents divorced (i was 12 or 13) he would talk to me about how my mom would refuse to have sex with him and it made him feel ‚Äúunloved‚Äù and ‚Äúemasculated‚Äù. 

-when i was a kid id see both my parents naked quite a lot. i‚Äôd wake up in the morning and climb into bed with them and they‚Äôd both be naked. or id go into the bathroom before/during/after either of them were showering and see them naked. once i knocked on my parents bedroom door at night because i had a nightmare or couldn‚Äôt sleep or something and my dad answered the door completely naked. idk if this is normal or not. 

i could go on. i dont know how much of this is normal. but for whatever reason, i thought as a kid that i needed to have sex. now, im straight. but when i was 13, i met a girl in the mental hospital, and she lived about a half hour drive from me. somebody in my family, usually my granddad, would drive me to this girls house. we were both homeschooled so sometimes id stay there for up to a week. 

this girl was my girlfriend and we had sex in her bedroom and her mom knew about it and didn‚Äôt care. i‚Äôm not gay, i‚Äôve never been gay or liked women i think, i just knew she liked me and i thought maybe that‚Äôs what i had to do, and i wasn‚Äôt being very in touch with my feelings because i was a child. but we would have sex and she‚Äôd give me head and i‚Äôd make fake noises. to this day i can‚Äôt stand getting head even though ive let people do it before, it feels so disgusting to me. she was 13 too, a month younger than me. towards the end of our ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù, she told me she had been sexually assaulted by a family member. 

from that point forward, i would be very interested in having sex and i had 7 different boyfriends between the ages of 14 and 17 that i gave head to at one point or another. i really liked giving head. but i feel like its inappropriate for someone as young as 13 or 14 or 15 to be doing all that, and i feel like its something with my dad. 

to this day, my dad will still say things to me about his sex life, even with me trying to set boundaries. i asked him to never mention sex with me when i reconnected with him at 18. he agreed, then told me a story about a time in mexico which was very long winded but essentially added up to, he went on a date with a woman, his college-aged friend gave him condoms just in case, my dad didn‚Äôt fuck the lady and so he gave the condoms back to his friend and the friend fucked his own girlfriend with them instead. i just kind of laughed and then went no-contact with him shortly after for that among other reasons. 

i just don‚Äôt know why im this way. was it my dad? does even mentioning sex to your kids screw them up this much? nowadays, i bounce back and forth between sex-repulsed and hypersexual. but at any point, if someone shows sexual interest in me, im disgusted by it and it makes me feel gross and objectified. i can‚Äôt do a casual hookup because i need sex to happen naturally and not be discussed prior. and i don‚Äôt have a boyfriend and don‚Äôt need one, im too mentally unstable. when i‚Äôve had sexual relationships in my adult life, ive been a doormat, just doing whatever my partner wants and having no needs/wants of my own, even making myself uncomfortable by not speaking up for myself. one ex just didn‚Äôt ever make me cum. he‚Äôd just have sex with me and then we were finished. the other wanted to, but it would go on way too long and i didn‚Äôt want to do it anymore but neither of us had finished and i didn‚Äôt want to disappoint him. he also told me i was bad at sex and asked me to do some things that felt very uncomfortable and degrading, but i did them anyway because i wanted to please him. he also finished inside me without asking once. i had an IUD so no pregnancy scare but i still think that was assault. 

another thing that happened that is kind of a mystery to me. one time, my dad was on vacation in baltimore with my uncle. they were at the guinness brewery there. and allegedly another friend of theirs was there, too. i was at home at my moms and i got a text from my dad. it read something like, ‚Äúi can‚Äôt wait to get home so i can have my way with you‚Äù. my dad then told me that the text was a ‚Äúprank‚Äù from the other friend and he thought he was texting my dads girlfriend at the time. i asked my uncle about this a while back and he has no recollection of the incident. but i don‚Äôt know if that means anything. i kind of feel like it might be plausible that my dad did it on purpose. but also nothing else like that ever happened before or since, so i don‚Äôt know. he also told me a story when i was a kid that involved my younger brother (2 yrs younger) masturbating. 

and a lot of the time, between ages 14 and 15, when i was giving the boys that i was with head and making out with them, i was at my dads house and he knew we were up there together. 

please tell me your thoughts, psychoanalyze me in the comments, i wanna know what you think happened or what‚Äôs going on.

You having intrusive thoughts doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt love your boyfriend, from what I‚Äôm understanding you‚Äôre used to receiving attention from bad people so it‚Äôs normal and a trauma response for you to think about unwanted attention when you‚Äôre in the mood. It will take time to get used to healthy intimacy, and it‚Äôs a complicated process I don‚Äôt think people who hasn‚Äôt experienced SA will understand. Maybe hold on to that thought for now but you should definitely let your boyfriend know that you constantly experience sexual assault in public because that‚Äôs not okay. It‚Äôs hard to stand up for yourself when you feel vulnerable and traumatized but knowing there are people who love you and don‚Äôt want you to undergo that all the time will definitely help.

all this to say even tho you weren't technically abused by your dad, the impact is essentially the same and for that I'm very sorry and wish you endless healing and love. 

I've had to heal a lot of things this year but one thing that I've done to heal my relationship with sex is essentially self pleasure where I regularly check in with myself.

1hg9olm,post,I feel like they knew what they were doing ,"Sorry if this post is a little all over the place. I think I‚Äôm hypomanic right now. 

So I was sexually assaulted by a 30 year old woman (I‚Äôm gonna call person A) and while a 33 year old man (I‚Äôm gonna call person B) watched and contributed to it when I was 19. There was a massive power imbalance between us and I feel like that was taken advantage of. When I initially met up with them I was already drunk, and when they got to the liquor store they told me to wait outside. They were in there for like 10 or so minutes. They got a drug that was a stimulant but they said it was for ‚Äúthem‚Äù and that ‚ÄúI was too young for it‚Äù. When we got back A kept feeding me shot after shot while we were doing stuff and it got to a point where I had barely any idea what was going on. They only left me alone after I got sick from the alcohol. When I initially confronted them A screamed at me while B acted confused. 

Later B convinced me to cut off A, and convinced me that she alone assaulted me. B then brought me into a 12 step fellowship for drug addicts (which I am still apart of) and would shut me down anytime I tried to talk about what happened to me. I finally confronted him about his role in this recently and he admitted what he did was wrong and apologized. 

I just can‚Äôt help but feel like what they did to me is intentionally. I‚Äôve considered asking him but I really feel like I shouldn‚Äôt. 

As an an aside when I first met them person A would frequently talk about how young I was, and about how I was ‚Äúbasically a child‚Äù. ",2,1.0,2024-12-17 12:36:06,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hg9olm/i_feel_like_they_knew_what_they_were_doing/

m2howjn,comment,,"I‚Äôm sorry the assault happened to you. It can be hard on your romantic relationship but I‚Äôm happy you‚Äôve had someone to support you during this time.

I‚Äôm assuming he‚Äôs aware of the assault and you‚Äôve set clear boundaries after that? If you think it‚Äôs still unclear try communicating again precisely how you feel. It‚Äôs important that he understands that your boundaries are deeply affected after the incident. From what I‚Äôm reading it seems like he has been mindful of your boundaries after your assault. 

If you‚Äôre thinking of his behavior prior to the assault, though I think he should‚Äôve stopped when you said no, he might‚Äôve not been clear about boundaries since you two didn‚Äôt seem to have that talk yet. And from I‚Äôm reading you seemed to be lighthearted with expressing your boundaries so I assume he didn‚Äôt take things seriously. I‚Äôm not saying this is acceptable but I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs pressuring you, he seems willing to stop when you make it clear. 

I would never speak for someone who doesn‚Äôt respect boundaries, but if you feel comfortable in this relationship and think you‚Äôre able to communicate your boundaries with him in a way that lets him know you‚Äôre 100%, I don‚Äôt want you to give up on a relationship that you love and feel supported in.

1hgd8ge,post,Need help supporting wife,"Minor trigger Warning: specific sex acts. I put the act at the very end and clearly labeled it if you don‚Äôt want to read it.

 I‚Äôm desperate for some guidance from anymore that may be able to help. Me and my wife have been together for 7 years, I move several states away to be with her and it‚Äôs been an amazing experience. She‚Äôs an incredible woman. I‚Äôve known about her assault for a while which happened in high school, she hasn‚Äôt told anyone else, not even her parents, and there haven‚Äôt been any major triggering events, and we actually developed a pretty healthy sex life, and we‚Äôve both tried new things that we haven‚Äôt with any other partner, but last night we tried something not thinking anything of it, but she had a trauma response, a bad one. 

I was able to get her to come to bed eventually and was there for her that night, I thought things would be good in the morning I just knew to let her be the one to talk about and just be there for her. It‚Äôs been two days now and all I‚Äôve gotten out of her is she felt exactly like that day and can‚Äôt look at me or talk to me, doesn‚Äôt want hugs or touching at all. I told her I‚Äôll respect all of it and whenever she‚Äôs ready even if it takes a while I‚Äôll be there for her. But right now I‚Äôm super scared of doing or saying the wrong thing. Like do I give her space by sleeping in a different room for a bit? Will that make it worse? I don‚Äôt know what to do because it‚Äôs never been an issue like this for 7 years. 

Before anyone responds with needing therapy, I‚Äôm well aware of that, but therapy isn‚Äôt going to do any good if she doesn‚Äôt want any part of it. What I‚Äôm asking, is for any tools I can use to be there and support her while she needs it, and what are some things to absolutely not do? I‚Äôm just super concerned about doing something that I think may fix it, but instead makes her more withdrawn or something even worse. 

(SEX ACT) 
Also I may as well explain what exactly happened, we had done anal before but increased the size of the plug and when she came, there was an accident, i knew i needed to stop to prevent any bacterial issues, she found out and lost it. I thought yeah it‚Äôs a bit embarrassing but embarrassing things are bound to happen between a married couple and it‚Äôs nothing to worry about.

most ppl dont realize taking some action, any action can really help healing. & youre doing that! 

you put yourself first (as you should) & youre not protecting him. this will help so many things that you dont realize yet.

i always get üòî or üò° when ppl dont at least try to do something.

remember, be clinical when you talk to someone or write down the event. but then the feeling part is very important & where you should talk/write about everything.

this helps someone understand why this happened. what it did to you. how he didnt have consent. what you deal with every day now.

it helps to practice writing everything out. have you started a trauma journal yet? if not, you should. it also helps your mind & your ptsd writing it down on paper & with when you do the reporting.

1hgetfg,post,don‚Äôt know how to feel,"i just want to thank the people who supported me on my last post. 

tldr: i may have been assaulted when i was blackout drunk by a good friend. i don‚Äôt remember anything at all that night after i passed out, and am starting to understand how i might have repressed it and the fallout. 

i am starting to accept that something happened, but does anyone have advice for remembering? even though this situation keeps coming up, and i feel real anxiety about it, i can‚Äôt help but think im still making it up. i very subtly asked the assaulter (was an old friend and reaching out once a year was common, even when things still were uncovered) if we had sex that night, and he dodged the question but rememered us fooling around a few months later (which i felt also disgusted about). because he said we didn‚Äôt have sex, i feel like i made all this up in my head. but i still can‚Äôt stop thinking about it. it‚Äôs coming close to the time of year it would‚Äôve happened and maybe that‚Äôs why i can‚Äôt stop thinking about it. i really don‚Äôt know what to believe. i don‚Äôt trust him at all but i want to believe nothing happened. but if nothing happened why do i feel like this? but i also don‚Äôt want to ruin someone‚Äôs reputation (even to myself and people who don‚Äôt know him) if nothing happened ??? i still feel insane. 

i‚Äôve also been getting like this feeling of something when ive been falling asleep recently, like grabbing? and my nightmares are getting worse. more chasing and some grabbing/ assault. but it‚Äôs never him, just random men and some men i know.my dreams have always been bad, but the past few years have been noticeably worse. 

he reached back out today after that conversation and i feel nauseous. i don‚Äôt know what to do. we were good friends, but i don‚Äôt want to see him again ",1,1.0,2024-12-17 16:45:50,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hgetfg/dont_know_how_to_feel/

1hgevvu,post,Is it SA because I wouldn‚Äôt get an abortion?,"The conversation happening in another post regarding stealthing has me thinking of what my ex (30M) said to me (27F).

Prior to us being intimate, he made clear that he didn‚Äôt want children. Nor did I. I truly can‚Äôt take birth control (messes with meds, mental health & caused a slew of physical issues). I told him this & asked him to use condoms, but he insisted he was ‚Äútoo big‚Äù for them.  So instead, he‚Äôd pull out, use spermicide gel & we watched my cycles. 

We had a brief conversation about what would happen if I got pregnant & I answered truthfully at that time. I genuinely believed I would be able to get an abortion. 

One of the times we were intimate, he didn‚Äôt pull out. I didn‚Äôt really panic since it was still before I was supposed to ovulate, so I took the plus size girls version of plan b (Ella, I believe?). This one isn‚Äôt like regular plan b, you can only take it once per cycle. I told him this & told him he had to be careful going forward. No more finishing inside & we HAD TO use the gel.

Next time we were intimate, he didn‚Äôt use the gel AND he finished inside again. I wasn‚Äôt happy, but it takes two to tango.

Of course, I got pregnant. I told him the night I found out and he LOST IT. He didn‚Äôt talk to me for a few days & anytime he did it was just to tell me about how distraught he was. He apparently threw up, was shitting blood, unable to eat or sleep, etc etc. 

After thinking on it for a few days, I realized I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to have an abortion. I just couldn‚Äôt do it. I really thought I‚Äôd be able to, but being in that situation it felt impossible. When I told him this, I reassured him that I‚Äôd ask for nothing from him & understood if he wanted to move on with his life‚Ä¶

Then he drops on me that I SA‚Äôd him. His reasoning? He wouldn‚Äôt have consented to sex if he knew I wouldn‚Äôt get an abortion‚Ä¶

So‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs your thoughts? Is it SA because I wouldn‚Äôt get an abortion??

1hgf8l2,post,"If a woman has ""sexual relationship"" with an underage boy, it's not a relationship. It's abuse","I intentionally put ""sexual relationship"" between "" because just as I said in the title- it's not a relationship - it's abuse. I find it really terrible how society views and treats female sex offenders and how it treats their victims, especially if they're male. I've read so many times titles in newspapers that talked about ""a relationship between a female teacher and male student"", ""love affair"" and other trivialising terms, while the reality of what happened has nothing to do with that - it's abuse, and it's equally severe as if male offender did it to an underage girl, and it should be equally condemned.

Abuse of underage boys by female offenders is often minimised, made fun of and often, I feel like it's not even recognised as abuse. People joke about how teen boys ""want it"" and ""dream about something like that"". It's disgusting. I don't care if the boy ""wanted it"" or not, because he's still a child, even if he's teenager. And I can't see the woman who abused him as anything but an adult who knows very well what she is doing, exploiting the trust and natural curiosity of the child and harming them. It's terrible, and female offenders should get equally harsh sentences as male offenders.

1hggega,post,What do I do?,"I (26F) was sexually abused as a minor by my older brother (who‚Äôs 10 years older). When I was 5 or 6 we would do an ‚Äúexchange‚Äù. If I wanted to borrow his games, I had to take my pants off. My child mind thought this was fine, I didn‚Äôt see the problem. I always noticed he was jumpy and anxious when I was undressed, but that didn‚Äôt stop the ‚Äúexchange‚Äù. The first time I had any inkling that what we were doing was wrong when I tried to ‚Äúexchange‚Äù with a stranger. I don‚Äôt remember much about the stranger or the interaction, but he was a family friend. I only really remember his hands down my pants, and when he asked if that was ‚Äúok‚Äù I said ‚Äúyea, my brother does it all the time‚Äù. The stranger jumped away and ran out of the house. After that, my brother never asked me to take my clothing off to borrow video games ever again.¬†¬†

When I was 11-12, my brother became physically abusive. At this age I was more familiar with right and wrong, and after an incident where he nearly killed me I finally told my mother of the sexual abuse in the past.

She told me to shut up. I left out that we‚Äôre an Asian family and we don‚Äôt really talk about our issues.

Anyways, for whatever reason my parents split and I moved to a different city with just my mother. No one laid a hand on me ever again so the memory slowly slipped from my mind. I wouldn‚Äôt say I was particularly haunted by it, the acts of physical abuse always seemed to stand out more to me. Maybe it was my age of when it happened? I remember so little from that age, I didn't really think about that part of my life at all¬†

Regardless, I am being haunted by it *now*. I cant sleep at night anymore. I feel sick to my stomach. I worry about intimacy with others.¬†I felt like I had moved passed it, I actually see my brother on a fairly frequent basis to just hang out. He doesn‚Äôt touch me and he apologizes profusely, telling me that he regrets our childhood.

Adding - I respect that you are planning on keeping the baby. If you decide that you want the abortion, you can do this in private without telling him or anyone else. You don‚Äôt deserve to have a baby you didn‚Äôt want, and you don‚Äôt have to have a baby from a coercive sexual assault just because you feel responsible or guilty. That would only be punishing yourself for his crime. Abortion exists for rape and it‚Äôs okay. It doesn‚Äôt make you a bad person. You are blaming yourself by saying the two to tango part. I would 100% be getting the abortion and never speaking to him again, and lining up evidence for the police. Again it‚Äôs okay if you genuinely want a baby! But please don‚Äôt fall for this man‚Äôs emotional manipulation of trying to tell you what to do with the pregnancy. He wants total control over you and is saying whatever he can to maintain it.

1hgit4z,post,Had my first kiss drunk and I feel gross and embrassed,I don‚Äôt know how to feel about this and maybe I‚Äôm overreacting but I attempted a party with my coworkers and there was a lot of drinking Involved. But a coworker who has been trying to talk to me approached me last night. I‚Äôve rejected him and told all the coworkers that know about his feelings for me that I am not interested in the slightest. At the party he started talking to me and flirting and I was just so confused cause I was drunk and I couldn‚Äôt really concentrate on anything. But I think I ended up flirting with him and he ended up grabbing me and he made out with me. I know I flirted back but when I woke up the next morning I felt so embarrassed and gross because i had kissed him even tho I have no interest in him and all my coworkers saw. I would‚Äôve expected my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù to pull me away cause I was drunk and I‚Äôve expressed my disinterest in him with them. But they didn‚Äôt and when I texted one of them the next day of how I felt weird and embarrassed she told me ‚Äúnah you wanted it. You didn‚Äôt push him away‚Äù her words made me spiral and now I feel like it‚Äôs all my fault. Plus the guy won‚Äôt leave me alone even though I told him I was drunk and that it didn‚Äôt mean anything for me.

At night when everyone was asleep my cousin woke me up, telling me I should sleep in his bed since I might be 'cold'. I did as he said and as I started falling asleep my cousin put a pillow over my face and I felt my night dress slide up , I screamed but my screams were Muffled by the pillow , I remember him touching me but after that I'm not sure.. All I know is that a few minutes passed before his mother walkened in and pulled him away from me, I don't if I was actually raped... My mind is blurry but I know was assaulted... I want to speak up and tell my dad what happened but my cousins mother forced me not to tell anyone what happened that night, and I'm afraid no body will believe me.

Worst of all I'm filled with emotions of being unsure whether or not I'm still a virgin.. I don't want to live my teenage life worrying about whether or not I'm like my peers that are virgins..

1hgj34t,post,Trying to understand what happened,"So here it is, I am the oldest of three siblings and I have two brothers. I am a single 29 year old female, my  brother's are now 26 and 23. We all have a strained relationship. My youngest brother has practically no relationship with me and the middle one is barely on talking terms. Part of this reason is our father and there's another part that I am confused about. 

As kids, when we were 9, 6 and 3 probably, We had a maid (Middle aged lady) that helped around the house and stayed with us. We all (my parents and siblings) slept in the same room because of some reason and once I heard my parents fight (I thought it was because of me) and then basically my father ordered my mum to have sex with him. I was traumatized as I still was awake and I had to actually use the toilet as it was cold in the room because of air conditioner.  After trying to hold it in, I actually woke up and left for toilet when I heard the noise stop for sometime. Later on I slept out in hall. My mother did come out to check if I was ok, I pretended that it was. I think I talked to the maid about it or I don't know how it started, The maid made comments about my breasts (I was a fat kid, so I developed them early or that was just fat) and encouraged me to explore my body. She also would get naked with me and there was time when she encouraged my brothers to sit on top of my back when I was lying naked and play with my Bum. I don't know If I did it because I felt she wanted it or I don't know . I was 9. I feel I assaulted the maid because she would also get involved with the three of us, and I did encourage her to take her clothes off I feel. What makes me feel guilty is she was our maid and I feel there was some power dynamic involved too. I never told anyone about this. Later on she also stole some money from me, which I had stolen from my grandparents. After this she behaved really weirdly with us. Then another maid came and she was sexual only with me and not my brothers, when I tried to recreate the play we had with the earlier maid, with this new maid, she ran to the toilet nd didn't take her clothes off, I don't know If I assaulted her or I got exploited, as I reiterate I was 9.",1,1.0,2024-12-17 19:48:33,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hgj34t/trying_to_understand_what_happened/

I tried to go to therapy but it's too hard, I'm just not ready to open all that shit, not only what happened, I talk pretty freely about it, without details ofc. But mostly it's all the problems I have that I can't really deal with and I'm not ready to.
I still have days when I remember it, my brain starts to play bits and try to understand just why? I don't feel guilt, I was a child, it's not my fault. But I feel dirty, I feel awfully mistreated and the impact on my psyche just seeps into my life seemingly in every aspect.
I wish my parents knew or tried to support me more, talk to me, ask how I'm feeling, comfort me. They're not bad they just don't know how to deal with it and let me figure it out.
I wish children to be safe, to be loved and cared for and this shit to never happen to them.
We went to the police, even had an audition of sorts. He didn't show up. I really want to see him after all these years, dunno why. Just to look into his eyes and yet again realise how ""adults"" fuck up all my life and probably try to understand how this- a human being, can do something like that to a kid...
I'm sorry for ranting I just can't get it out of my system some days.

1hgkd3r,post,Need Help Confronting Assaulter,"Hello

So for some backstory, this summer I reported the sexual assault that happened to me 3 years ago by a family member. It‚Äôs been a tough process with me reporting so late and not having done a rape kit or anything like that, but I did a confrontation call with a detective in the room with me. Not much came out of it, he was pretty closed off and defensive the whole time (but was still saying he was sorry), although he kept insisting we talk more about it in person. I asked the detective if that‚Äôs an option to get a confession, he said yes (I live in an area where 1 party consent is legal) but I‚Äôd basically be on my own. I know it‚Äôs dangerous and I‚Äôm scared to do it, but it feels like my best chance at getting justice and keeping him from hurting more people (he has other victims besides me already). I‚Äôve been looking online to see if anyone else has had to deal with anything similar to this and I‚Äôve seen nothing. I guess I‚Äôm just wondering if you guys have any advice on how to best approach this confrontation? I‚Äôm thinking of basically meeting him in a public space with enough privacy for us to really talk about everything in hopes he‚Äôll feel more comfortable admitting everything it me in person. Please help, I don‚Äôt want to mess this up",1,6.0,2024-12-17 20:45:01,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hgkd3r/need_help_confronting_assaulter/

1hgl6sm,post,Sexual assault by mother?,"Throwaway account. So, this is hard to say because I‚Äôve never told anybody this. When I 33m was young, must‚Äôve been 9-12, somewhere in that area, I would love to lay in my parents bed when taking a nap. One time when I went to nap, my mother was in there, father at work, late teen sisters off doing their own thing. I didn‚Äôt think anything of it, just crawled under the blanket and rested my eyes. What woke me up was my mother rubbing the outside of my pants still seemingly asleep. I‚Äôm ashamed to admit it, but I liked the way it felt. I took it out and let her wrap her hand around it and touch me (still sleeping ?). It was exciting to me, my first sexual experience and I know I‚Äôm sick for thinking like that. I had barely even kissed a girl let alone something like that. It didn‚Äôt go further than that and I never climaxed but it stuck in my head. And it also never happened again. I don‚Äôt know if it was some weird sleep thing or a dream she was having or maybe she thought I was my father unconsciously? I just don‚Äôt know if I was sexually assaulted or am some different kind of messed up in the head for being excited by it.
Currently in life I am attending therapy and trying to figure out some of the other underlying reasons why I‚Äôm a damaged individual. I don‚Äôt know if this played a part or not because I can‚Äôt actually decipher if I was abused.

I was in an sa situation as a child and I shared that with him, halfway. He stopped me while I was telling him and said it made him uncomfortable hearing about sex in regards to children. Which tbh I completely understand that, it was hard and confusing to come to terms with for me since it happened.

But I'm currently pregnant and those things are fresh in my mind. Something about having a baby is making me worry for her. All the bad stuff that happened to me could happen to her too. 

He said he'd rather not talk about it anymore and I respect him and everything. But now I feel weird and wish i hadn't said anything. I apologized to him and he said not to worry about and and hugged me a lot but idk. I can't help but feel like I made everything weird between us and I finally told someone. I've never talked about it with anyone fully, not everything. 

I was just looking for a moment to let it out. I hoped he'd understand because he has also been sa. Maybe it was triggering? Idk and i just wish he'd have let me talk it out, I finally feel ready to tell someone and I only trust him enough to do that with. But still I want him to be okay too.",13,4.0,2024-12-17 22:14:48,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hgmdio/tried_to_tell_my_partner_about_my_sa_but_he/

1hgmdkq,post,i think my gf sa‚Äôd me,"wouldn't let me put this but this is sa involving a teen. throwaway because she has me on reddit and i don't want her seeing. also kind of nsfw by talking about sex lives and kinks and stuff

(ALSO i know it's not really appropriate for a teen to be discussing this kind of thing online. however im basically a legal adult and she is. i have nowhere else to go due to my age and lack of helping resources)

the other night me (trans guy) and my girlfriend (trans girl) were asleep together and she woke me up in the middle of the night. we have a CONSENSUAL somnophilia sitch cuz she's into it and the rule is that she has to ask for my consent before we go to sleep due to my being repeatedly assaulted in my sleep by two different people in my life (by my stepdad through most of elementary school and then my best friend for most of middle school when i would sleep over). however at about 6 that morning i woke up to her inside of me despite me not giving her any consent the night before (it didn't come up at all. i didn't say no either). i was trying to pull away because i didn't want to and i tried to ask her what was going on but i was so groggy and disoriented that i just laid there and let it happen until she was done. when she began to clean up i asked her what she was doing and she said ""you know what"" and i said ""but you didnt ask me first"" (in a 'joking' tone because i was trying to keep the mood light) and she said ""well you liked it so it doesn't matter"". for context, i HAVE mentioned being curious about cnc to help cope with the stuff that happened when i was young. however, i also said she'd have to ask for my consent beforehand.

i got physical pleasure from the experience, so what was i supposed to do? she's implied a few times since it happened that it doesn't count as rape if i enjoyed it and so i've just kind of buried it down. she seemed a little concerned when i told her i never told her she could have sex with me while i was asleep but she quickly got over it. after i was assaulted in middle school, it took me a while to stay at people's houses without having panic attacks, let alone sleep in the same bed as someone. i finally managed to start feeling better and was able to sleep in bed with someone else and even stay over at people's houses again. now, however, i don't really like the idea of it. she wants me to stay over sunday night, but i'm scared she'll do it again. i don't really feel comfortable being by myself with her anymore and my chest feels tight when i see her. i don't even know if this counts as rape.",19,6.0,2024-12-17 22:14:52,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hgmdkq/i_think_my_gf_sad_me/

If the lawyer states that he didn't know I was uncomfortable because he failed to ask me for consent, that's proof he assaulted me. Is there a way he could somehow win? I'm scared. He touched me and groped me without consent, could a lawyer somehow say what he did wasn't assault? I also was actively attempting to push him off. I want justice.

I have a fair amount of evidence, including a text message from him saying ""I wasn't super clear what you were comfortable versus uncomfortable with.""

so, obviously it wasn‚Äôt intentional by the dr. (f46) I think?

when I was 4/5ish I had a yeast infection (in lady parts) and I had to visit the dr and she decided to physically examine down there for several weeks in a row and she even called me in for special visits. basically idk why a tribe sample wasn‚Äôt enough?? but anyway she basically had her fingers all up in there and I was extremely uncomfortable 

now when I dissociate or have nightmares of being sexually assaulted im always face up on my back like I was then. and while talking to my therapist about it i kept repeating I felt like I was on an operating table naked and someone was touching me and staring at me. (I JUST now put the pieces together)

 the past 6 months I‚Äôve been dealing with dissociative sex patterns (f20) I‚Äôve also dealt with attraction to scenes of sexual assault my whole life even though it morally disgusts me. even when I was as young as 8 i remember feeling a tingle down there watching someone be forcibly pressured to do something (or while watching a predator kill its prey on natgeo wild‚Äîik it‚Äôs disgusting okay?!?! you don‚Äôt need to tell me)

1hgqltx,post,When does the healing begin?,"Background: My dad remarried when I was young, around 2. My step mom already had a son previously. I don‚Äôt remember the ‚Äúfirst time‚Äù it happened because as far as my memory goes back my step brother was molesting me. Thats how it‚Äôs always been. Since he lived with us, sometimes it would be multiple times a day. The first time he raped me I was 9, but he only would go all the way here n there. He liked touching me and making me do stuff to him more than actually raping me. He said he was scared of getting me pregnant. I was in the 3rd grade the first time I told someone. No one believed me, including CPS, and I felt so embarrassed. My parents were also physically and verbally abusive as times naturally so that didn‚Äôt help. Nonetheless, until my brother left for the military (when I was 17), I was regularly being sexually abused. Since then I‚Äôve only had a couple incidents. As long as I make sure I‚Äôm not left alone in a room with him I‚Äôll be good.

I guess my post has to do more with when will I stop feeling the effects so much? It‚Äôs been 3 years since the last incident (I‚Äôm 24 now). I still struggle with depression and anxiety. I overextend myself in relationships because I feel like I have to always be perfect to get someone to like me. I isolate myself and idk I just feel like I‚Äôm so complicated. I‚Äôm scared that I‚Äôll always be this damaged mentally/emotionally. Does time naturally heal this or will I always be kinda messed up? I think a lot of my trauma comes from my family not believing me. If I bring it up, I‚Äôm called crazy or a liar. If I cry about it, they make fun of me. If anyone has any advice on how to move on from never getting justice or support from family regarding sa please let me know cause I feel like I‚Äôm going crazy sometimes.

1hgqq5c,post,Was I sexually assaulted my braid is telling me other wise ,"I‚Äôm a 15 year old sophomore in America.
(I have been sexually assaulted before and I typically don‚Äôt prefer to do sexual things with guys due to my trauma)
To start off the story I wanted to start fresh and go to a new high school. I beginner my start at this new school in august. When I first moved I made a friend her name is Emma(16) we had a lot in common mostly that we drank and smoked. October of 2024 my close friend Emma basically SET ME UP and told me we were going to a fun high school party just to my surprise it was a set up two man that I was unaware of(a two man is basically when there is 2 girls and 2 boys and they basically hook up or start talking). When I got to this ‚Äúparty‚Äùno one else was there only Jackson(15), Adames(16), and my close friend Emma. there were a lot of alcoholic drinks and strangely hormonal honey packets which I was familiar with but I didn‚Äôt fuck with the honey packets. we were all just sitting in a circle drinking and talking. Jackson asks me to take a honey pack and i refuse to he takes like three. (You‚Äôre only supposed to take one) When Adames and Emma LEAVE ME ALONE IN A ROOM WITH THIS GUY. he begins to touch me I kept refusing and saying no let‚Äôs chill after a while i started drinking but Im still conscious and I didn‚Äôt really want to do anything. He keeps touching me romantically which I was obviously uncomfortable with and he knew that because he kept asking me to ‚Äútalk to me, tell me what‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù ‚Äú what‚Äôs bothering you? tell me‚Äù over and over again. Adames comes back into the room that me and Josh were in to get something and I asked him to go get Emma and he was like she‚Äôs sleep (I knew that was a fucking lie) I thought Emma would be my only hope to stop him from doing this to me. After a while of him trying to do shit with me I finally gave up and started making out with him. he keeps asking me to let him finger me or to fuck but I‚Äôm refusing to. he kept asking me to give him head. While we were making out he starts to push my head down implying that i give him head knowing that I didn‚Äôt want to. I was forced into giving him head and letting him finger me due to the fact that he kept asking me and pushing me to do it. the rest of the night I wanted to kill myself. I feel like I‚Äôve been emotionally and mentally stuck on him and I can‚Äôt stop thinking about him. My friend Emma doesn‚Äôt know what happened to me because her and the Jackson were best friends and I didn‚Äôt want to disrespect her in anyway and ruin my new friendship. we just decided not to talk about that night. I feel like I‚Äôm stuck on repeat and I keep telling my friends about what happened to me and when I tell them the story ‚Äúthey say so you got sexually assaulted?‚Äù. I kept trying to deny the fact that I did and it honestly hurts me more everyday. I tell people what happened to me in a positive way and leave out the fact that it was forced maybe to hide the hurt inside of me or maybe it was because I‚Äôm too embarrassed to admit that I had been sexually assaulted again . I even told a trusted male friend about what happened to me and he replied with ‚Äúsee this is why I can‚Äôt stand females every time you touch them they come up with the thought that you sexually assaulted them‚Äù after he told me that I felt like everything was my fault and maybe I was the one who pushed myself onto him but I know that was a lie. I SAID NO he should‚Äôve listened to me. Nothing should have happened that night and I knew that. Idk what the next step is. It‚Äôs been 2 months since that happened to me and the thought of me being sexually assaulted is starting to feel true and it‚Äôs honestly making me depressed. Can anyone give me advice on what to do I feel genuinely so alone but I‚Äôm glad I was able to tell people who understand me.",3,3.0,2024-12-18 01:44:06,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hgqq5c/was_i_sexually_assaulted_my_braid_is_telling_me/

1hgr1cj,post,Unhealthy coping mechanisms ,"15F first time I was actually SA‚Äôd was when I was 8 until I was 10 by a girl. Idc about her story. I‚Äôve been sexually harassed so many times. I was almost sexually assaulted when I was 12. I was blackmailed for almost a year straight when I was 14. I‚Äôve been sending nudes to men older than 30 ever since I was 14. The blackmail part has so much lore I‚Äôm not gonna get into it. He had my address and he would threaten to get guys to kill/rape me if I don‚Äôt send pics. I thought the threats were real and idc about ur opinion. 

Every time I hear someone grunting, I start screaming and throwing a fit. If someone tries to touch me I get nauseous and I throw a fit. Nobody knows about my story so I look ‚Äúlike a freak‚Äù. Or ‚Äúpsychotic‚Äù. When I thought my bf was asking to kiss me I started going to the bathroom, shaking, crying, and I almost puked 20 times.

m2lmgkh,comment,,"This actually happened over a year ago. I had the baby and he‚Äôs truly the light of my life. I fully support anybody‚Äôs choice to have an abortion & agree 100% with everything you said. I just discovered that I‚Äôm not capable of having one myself.

The story gets even crazier after what I shared. He tried pulling several manipulation tactics - saying he‚Äôd never speak to me again (I was sad, but respected it), claiming it was SA, using his health, trying to scare me/shame me regarding how my family may respond, and so much more. When that didn‚Äôt work, he ‚Äúaccepted it‚Äù and said he wanted to terminate rights as soon as possible. I agreed.
He didn‚Äôt speak to me until he realized that my other ex had reconnected and was showing up to my medical appointments with me. Then BD started saying that I couldn‚Äôt be with someone else, that he wanted to be involved, etc. I told him he was being manipulative, but offered for him to come & as soon as he had the opportunity he changed his mind again and dipped out. The last interaction I had with him was me threatening to call the cops bc he wouldn‚Äôt get out of my face or leave my house, with him screaming ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have to. You‚Äôre carrying my child.‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt even 2 months pregnant yet. 

I did not speak to him again. We had a mutual friend who reached out to inform me that BD was spiraling - lost his job, nearly lost housing, started drinking. And that he brings me up a minimum of 3-5x a week to blame me for everything wrong in his life. He even tried ‚Äújoking‚Äù with her that he would unalive himself on my due date. 

When my son was 10 months old, I received two voice notes from him. He was irate, screaming profanities & telling me that he hates me, wishes me the worst & tells me I‚Äôll get what I deserve. Then goes on to say he nearly unalived himself with a gun, making some weird comment about ‚Äúoh yeah, I have one of those by the way‚Äù. Shortly after he mentioned how he still knows where I live & he should‚Äôve just confronted me. He then says ‚ÄúI hope every time you see (sons name) you think of me‚Äù which shook me to my core bc he never knew my sons name. He found my business page (not linked on any socials) which mentions that I have a child & his name.

I have no clue if this counts but I need to get it off my chest. I haven‚Äôt told my therapist, it‚Äôs too uncomfortable. When I was around seven years old, I was with my twin brother and older cousin who was around ten or eleven. He pressured (like as a dare) me to put my brother‚Äôs ‚Äúpart‚Äù in my mouth.
As a child I had no idea of the implications and did it, it was the same for my brother.
My cousin laughed and ran to tell my family.
I don‚Äôt remember anything after that, thank god my brother doesn‚Äôt remember. This has weighed on me for so long, I only recently even remembered this happened, I think my brain blocked out the memory or something. 
It‚Äôs extremely traumatizing because I committed an act of incest and feel extreme guilt. Was this CSA?

I actually did initially read the OP‚Äôs post yesterday when it was originally posted and I decided at the time to not delete or remove it with this particular sub rule in my mind.  

I did so on the basis that I don‚Äôt believe that the OP post was in the context of the intention behind the original purpose of why this rule was originally intended and I have therefore left it and allowed it to remain.  Hopefully all of you regular members of the sub can see and understand my reasoning for this.  So with that in mind there is no more need for any of you to continue to report it.

If it does verge into the other unknown realms then I will of course delete it accordingly

We try to go slow or maybe do new things but even then I seem like I can‚Äôt get excited. I never initiate anything. It‚Äôs giving me sm anxiety to the point where I‚Äôll convince myself I‚Äôm asexual to avoid the fact this is because of trauma. 

Please, someome who has been through this, how did you get back into it? I want to want things. Sex is not important yes but I want to feel desire. I don‚Äôt want to feel nervous, robotic, and empty whenever sex is brought up.

1hgwdza,post,He was so insensitive ,"My bf made a stupid comment earlier, and I'm so angry I can't sleep. He and I have been together for 2 years. He was definitely not my first bf. The thing is, when I was 16 I was raped by someone I trusted. I became hypersexual afterwards because I felt like if I did it enough times, maybe it would erase what happened. It always just made me feel crappy, but you do what you can. I got therapy, turned my life around, and tried to move on.

It was the dumbest thing. We were talking about toy sizes, and he said that I shouldn't be using them. That with my body count, using toys would make it a hot dog down a hallway thing, and would make it less fun for him. The worst part is he knows my body count was high because of my trauma. It was such a hurtful thing to hear him say and besides its a myth that women get loose from having multiple partners. I really like him, and I how I can move on from this. It just feels like another thing my rapist did that fucks with my life. I'm still damaged no matter how much therapy I go through.

Has anyone else had their partner say something like this? Did you get through it, or break up? In case it's important, he did apologize after and said he shouldn't have said it. ",4,5.0,2024-12-18 07:19:59,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hgwdza/he_was_so_insensitive/

1hgxyt8,post,"My life was bad and then I made it so much worse and it‚Äôs all my fault. Cw:CSA,Drugs,Child Porn","I‚Äôm (17F) and since I was 8 I was constantly raped and abused my multiple different people. Someone even tried to drug and kidnap me before when I was 11. Then when I was 14 I started drinking and doing drugs because I was sick of repeatedly being hurt and it was the only thing that would make me forget about it. And I had tried other things like therapy,antidepressants,hospital but nothing helped and then it was like when I was drunk or high nothing mattered anymore. I didn‚Äôt care about what happened. 

But then one day my drug dealer asked if I wanted to do some with him and he‚Äôd drive me home after because I had already a bit drank before getting there and he was scared I‚Äôd get hurt if I get high on top of that. And I trusted that and I usually did it alone and it was quite lonely. And I did so much that I passed out. And he raped me. And he took pictures and filmed it. Then he made me leave on my own. And I don‚Äôt fully remember how I got home but I did luckily. But then the next day he sent me the videos and photos saying if I don‚Äôt send him nudes he‚Äôll post them everywhere. So I complied for a while. But he started asking for them like almost hourly and would get really aggressive and threatening if I wouldn‚Äôt send them. 

Even if I was in school or something. He‚Äôd be like ‚ÄúYou think I care? Go to the bathroom or something unless you want everyone to know how much of a pathetic whore you are‚Äù. And eventually I had enough and I was like ‚ÄúFuck you. I know you‚Äôre bullshitting. If you post the videos it‚Äôll just incriminate you. I‚Äôll report you for being not only a dealer but a nonce too and if you post it you‚Äôll be incriminating yourself.‚Äù And he was like ‚ÄúYou did drugs that‚Äôs a crime too. You‚Äôd be shooting yourself in the foot if you went to the police dumb bitch send it you know what will happen.‚Äù And I just said ‚ÄúDie.‚Äù And blocked him. 

I was scared for days but nothing happened until I started getting messages on my social media account and on WhatsApp from creeps. They said they saw the video and pictures. Turns out he posed some of the rape pics and videos and some of the nudes I sent saying that the reason I sent the nudes was because I ‚Äòenjoyed being raped so much‚Äô. And there was a thing like if you sent him money he‚Äôd send all of the rest and give out my number and social media to them.

So people PAID like ¬£10 to see it. And was giving me death threats. Saying they‚Äôll come to my house and kill me and my family if I don‚Äôt meet up with them. And I got offers to have sex for money. Or to send more nudes for money. It was gross I had to block like 20 people and I wonder how many more paid to see the extra content but not to contact me. 

So I told the police. And showed the evidence and they said it‚Äôs my fault for getting illegal drugs and drunk underage. And from the video and nudes it looks like I consented and me sending nudes technically makes me a sex offender because it counts as sharing child pornography even though it was my own. And maybe I‚Äôm just framing this guy. So they can‚Äôt do anything and I‚Äôm lucky that they decided to just give me a warning on my crimes. 

I already felt so guilty and I know I should‚Äôve but this made me have a breakdown. And I was still getting harassed. So I eventually decided if he can make money off of me and I‚Äôm already being humiliated anyway I should make money off myself because I needed the money and my image is already ruined. So I started to sell pictures of myself without my face and name attached tho. And then people really wanted to see my face and to meet me. And I would do meet ups for money. 

When I was 15 I stopped on and off because I would know what I was doing was making my mental health worse. And dangerous. But I needed the money. So I kept doing it again. I eventually stopped completely at 16. But the guilt still eats me up alive. I‚Äôm now an actor and like a low level instagram famous. I get recognised sometimes in public and I have a bit of a fan base which has been my dream since I was a child but now I‚Äôm scared. 

I use a stage name on my social media‚Äôs and acting gigs which is like a remix of my actual name. Because I‚Äôm scared it‚Äôll be easier to somehow find the rape videos and nudes. I‚Äôm so scared of being found out. And I‚Äôm so scared that one day they‚Äôll be exposed and my life will be over again and no one will ever hire me again. And everyone will hate me for doing drugs and being a slut.

I can‚Äôt live with myself. I hate myself. And I know it‚Äôs my fault but knowing anyone could find this is eating me alive. I‚Äôve had 2 stalkers from my slight fame. What if one of them finds this? I just can‚Äôt do it anymore. I want to die. ",27,8.0,2024-12-18 09:23:31,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hgxyt8/my_life_was_bad_and_then_i_made_it_so_much_worse/

Also, if any of that came out (which it is so unlikely it would), you would not be ruined. He is a drug dealer, you were underage. Lots of people understand that you are not able to consent at that age and you were taken advantage of. It is also possible that if it came out, you could sue for defamation. 

No one hates you for doing drugs and being used by older men. It doesn‚Äôt matter what people think anyway. You were young and didn‚Äôt know what to do.

1hh2236,post,I found out today that I was drugged and raped ‚Ä¶. ,"Some context: 
I used to have a drug problem, opiates. I never did needles or any other drugs. My ex of 12 years got me into it and we used together. We have been broke up about 3 years now, I‚Äôve been sober for 2 1/2 - 3 years. We used to hangout with some sketchy people, mainly one guy who was obsessed with me. 

So today my ex texts me and says there is a video of me being raped and giving someone oral sex. I don‚Äôt remember this, I really don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs true. It can‚Äôt be. I was never alone with this person and his gf was always there. Apparently his gf told my ex that she drugged us both and then I was raped‚Ä¶. So she could get free drugs from said guy, we can call him N. 

I am so worried about everything now. What is this is true? He told me 5 other people said it was true and there is a video. How do I live with myself after this? Is it my fault for having a bad lifestyle prior? My ex said I was sleeping with him for money but I always had a good job and supported my own habit. So that can‚Äôt be true. 

I am trying to keep it together rn. I called my friend who is a cop and he told me what to do. I guess this is Karma for being a bad person before? I really don‚Äôt think I can continue to be alive of all this is true. 

I feel‚Ä¶ lost. 
I am trying to better my life and move forward and the past is a black hole. ",23,26.0,2024-12-18 13:54:26,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hh2236/i_found_out_today_that_i_was_drugged_and_raped/

m2nrw4b,comment,,"Honey, no. This is not your fault. This is not karma. Doing drugs doesn‚Äôt mean you deserve ‚Äòkarma‚Äô or to be raped, and your ex can frankly fuck off with his ‚Äúsleeping with him for money‚Äù shit.

Try to stop, breathe. Ground yourself. Okay? Ground yourself first, and then deconstruct this to the bets of your ability, but keep a healthy distance in your mind so you don‚Äôt feel a pull towards relapsing due to the distress. 

Right now you don‚Äôt know if any of this is true. You‚Äôve already demonstrated that your ex will lie to you and make shit up to hurt you. So that‚Äôs the starting point. Now,

Do you know the five other people claiming what was said was true? Has he *told* you their names? If not, *will he?* (And if he does, are they people you would trust not to make shit up for him?)

I could go into more thoughts to offer about that, but for the moment I think the biggest thing it hinges on is the questions about those five people. If he‚Äôll give you the names, if you trust them not to lie for him, or if he refuses to tell you who is saying that.

But this is not your fault. You did not deserve this.

He is a selfish cad, who is angry you left him and gave up drugs,  who only thought about his own base revenge. He is exploiting shame, growing seeds of despair.  Pursuing charges may give you some sense of control, and move toward justice. I am so sorry.



I would focus on recovery. You have shock, pain, & guilt swirling. How could this happen to you? Why me, why now? You are on the road to recovery.   You have certain physical, emotional, and psychological trauma. Please process it with a good friend, mentor, sibling, parent, or counselor. Hopefully you are in AA, or Celebrate Recovery.  You will feel guilty trusting the wrong person, and not fighting like hell. You may become depressed, angry, or anxious. Please do not clam up, or flip out. It will take time to process but you will get better. Over time the pain will yield. This too shall pass. 



Overtime YOU WILL RECOVER. How will you adapt is key.

m2nxs7f,comment,,"Hey there OP, I really hope that you‚Äôre doing okay and that you‚Äôre all well and good.

I have read your whole post and everything that you‚Äôve said in it and my own personal thoughts and opinions on this situation are as follows.

First off whilst reading your post and as I was reading more and more of it, my first instinct and initial thoughts were that it appears to me like your ex boyfriend is trying to pull you back into the whole situation that you were in before when you were together with him.  That what he has said to you about there being a video recording of you being raped and also giving someone else oral, my initial thoughts are that he is using this against you in order to drag you back into being in his life but to also drag you back into that same old drug addiction lifestyle again.

The reason why I immediately thought this is because that‚Äôs what people always tend to do who you‚Äôve previously been in a relationship with where drugs are also a significant factor and part of that relationship.  This is because in those types of relationships where drugs are a primary aspect, you both always become co dependent on each other because you both are always seeking out the next fix so to speak and they try to drag you back into because they are still codependent on you.  

Anyway that was my very initial thoughts that he was lying about what he said to you about there being a video recording of you in regards to what he said had been recorded.

The second thing that I have to say to you OP is that upon further reading of your post you even said that you don‚Äôt believe for one minute that there is a video recording of you at all.  That it‚Äôs not possible and that it doesn‚Äôt even make any sense to you how there could even be a video recording because there was never an opportunity for one to have even been made or recorded of you, so this even further supports my initial thoughts about this whole situation.  So personally OP i honestly and truthfully don‚Äôt believe for one single minute that there is any recording of you at all. 

However, let‚Äôs play devils advocate for a few minutes here, let‚Äôs just theoretically say that there is actually a video recording of you being raped and also giving someone else oral.  What can you actually do about it? You could ask those people who you do know from back then in your old lifestyle to delete any copies that they have of it, but even then OP you won‚Äôt know who else has a copy of the video and how many people have a copy of it, so it would be a pointless exercise in you even asking those people who you do know to delete the copies that they have of it.

Then there‚Äôs the other aspect here OP, of what can any of them from your old lifestyle do with the video if they have a copy of it? They can‚Äôt do a single thing with it.  If they try and share it with others then they are committing a criminal offence by sharing it, they also can‚Äôt try and use it to blackmail you with it because that‚Äôs another criminal offence they are committing but most of all OP, if you don‚Äôt let what they are saying to you about it and don‚Äôt give them a single reaction then any video recording is absolutely worthless to them.  That‚Äôs just the worst case scenario here OP if there was possibly a video recording in existence, not to mention that it would be a recording of you being raped so there‚Äôs no way that it would even be shared if a video even existed in the first place.

Now onto the next part OP and this is the most important part OP.  That is that you have already escaped that toxic and drug addiction lifestyle 3 years ago, you‚Äôve now been completely clean of drugs and addiction for the last 2.5 years, all by yourself.  I truly applaud and admire you for being able to do this and to be able to continue in doing this.  

However, you have made a small fundamental mistake here OP, that mistake is where you have completely left that toxic relationship with your ex boyfriend, that you have left that environment with him where drugs and drug addiction was involved, that you have also left everything else from that whole lifestyle BUT the one thing that you didn‚Äôt leave behind is that you should have left the ability for him to still be able to get in contact with you, that you didn‚Äôt go full no contact with him and with anyone else from that specific period of your life.  

So your only response to this whole situation and your next move here is to change your mobile number for a brand new number, also make sure that you completely block your ex boyfriend and anyone else that is associated with him and also anyone else who was around you and in your life back then so that none of them can ever get in contact with you and then you just continue on with your current life, continue on with your current healing and recovery journey and you keep on smashing all of those targets and goals that you‚Äôve set for yourself and don‚Äôt ever give any of them from that old era a way back in to your life and future 


I hope that is of some help to you in one way or another

m2o243l,comment,,">So I told the police. And showed the evidence and they said it‚Äôs my fault for getting illegal drugs and drunk underage. And from the video and nudes it looks like I consented and me sending nudes technically makes me a sex offender because it counts as sharing child pornography even though it was my own. And maybe I‚Äôm just framing this guy. So they can‚Äôt do anything and I‚Äôm lucky that they decided to just give me a warning on my crimes.

Sounds like your local police could all be prison-worthy. The best thing I think you can do right now is reach out to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (if you're in the U.S., if you're in another country they likely have a similar organization). A couple places that might help on their website are

m2o45n1,comment,,"Thank you. 
Yes you are right. I should have zero contact. I was helping him finically and I think it was because of quilt. I did cheat on him once when I got sober and he wouldn‚Äôt and I felt stuck, which is no excuse. I left him and moved on and I know I need to forgive myself and have no feet in the past. 

The drugs I was doing, fentanyl was mixed with benzos sometimes and it would make you basically on autopilot. I don‚Äôt think I ever went there alone. But I can‚Äôt remember‚Ä¶. I lost months of my life but I just think that this all would have came out a long time ago? It‚Äôs been years now. 

I have now blocked him. He is saying he is going to kill himself but I cannot be responsible for that. 

I just am scared, if this is true, everyone will say it‚Äôs my own fault. I put myself in that situation. I was too trusting. 

I am going to get checked for STDs after work today. I have zero symptoms of anything but I haven‚Äôt been check in a long time cause I was only with my ex and then my fianc√© (that I left now) and we used condoms. 

The biggest issue for me is the not remembering. The time I lost. Idk‚Ä¶ I hope this isn‚Äôt true. I don‚Äôt think I am strong enough to deal with all this.

My called my friend who is a cop and he told me what to do, but idk if I‚Äôm strong enough to deal with the judgement if this is true. I knew they were bad people but I still hung out there. I was never alone with him and I only ever went there to get drugs for myself AND my boyfriend. This is all just coming out of nowhere. 

I always wonder why peoele who have assault happen to them don‚Äôt report it, but now I know the shame of it and embarrassment is so strong. I don‚Äôt even wanna tell anyone in my life this is going on. I can‚Äôt talk to anyone. 

The man I love who I left my ex for, who put up with me when I was using and tried so hard to save me, we are seeing each other again now that I left my fianc√© (who is a coke head) and the thought of telling him this makes me sick. Will he look at me differently? Will he think I am disgusting?

m2odczu,comment,,"Like I tried to get across to you, that let‚Äôs say that there was an actual video recording, they couldn‚Äôt even do anything with it anyway because just imagine the huge consequences of any of them sharing a video recording of a person being raped on the video? The criminal consequences, the social, the friendship and family consequences of any of them sharing a video of someone being raped? Nobody would remain in contact with someone who is sharing a video of someone being raped plus the jail time they would get for doing it.  

Again like you also just said to me in your latest reply above, that if such a video recording actually existed, then they would have said something about it to you well before now, but I also just wanted to say to you that what you also said in your last reply to me about your ex boyfriend also saying to you that now he is going to kill himself, this proves to me without any doubt that what he said to you about there being a video recording of you being raped and giving someone else oral is complete nonsense and lies.  

He tried to use this to try and hook you back in and to try and drag you back but it hasn‚Äôt worked out and he hasn‚Äôt got the reaction or the response that he was hoping for here, so now he has immediately moved on to the next step by telling you that he is going to kill himself.  So there‚Äôs definitely no video for you to be worried about. 

If you hadn‚Äôt of blocked him like I advised you to then when he didn‚Äôt get any reaction or response from you when he said that he was going to kill himself then he would have come out with something else afterwards which would have also been something emotional to try and manipulate you back in.

Anyway forget all about it now OP and continue moving on in your life doing what you have been doing and what you are continuing to do, you hold absolutely no guilt at all here 

Best wishes

1hh5kst,post,What do I do TW: slight sa and selfharm,"so my bf (now ex) and i got to together like 2 months ago and there was already problems like his shame and insecurity and it was starting to affect me too. However the real problem started when his friend (who are dating my friends as well) was giving him tips on how to take our relationship to the ""next level"" and this involved him touching me in places (mind you his friend dont even respect his own girlfriend and touch her  in ways they dont like too) which  i did not like at all as i have been sa'ed many times and it didnt help that he touched the same places i was sa'ed at. This made me uncomfy as he didnt asked nor talk to me about it. Now i will say i may have brought this on myself as for i did make sexual jokes and i am hyper-sexual but i still have told  myself i would have save myself until i feel safe with the person im with. But this was the last straw for me because when i talk to him about him just sweep it under the rug and  i have always felt like i had no control over my body. so i have left him (no to mention he is EXTREMELY clingy and when he hugs me he hugs too tight and wont let go  which is very uncomfortable . But the kicker is that is he has started cutting himself and it feels like my fault. Like if i didnt leave maybe he would have been okay and he being over pityful. like saying he is going to kill himself and things and i dont know what to do from here.",1,3.0,2024-12-18 16:39:00,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hh5kst/what_do_i_do_tw_slight_sa_and_selfharm/

First, I wouldn‚Äôt reach out to him yet. I know people get tired of the *therapy!* response, but it may not hurt to have even just a few sessions with some kind of counselor to work through some of this and try to come to a decision. Did you get sober through a program? I did, the reason I ask is because my clinic would assign you with a counselor you could talk to about things. 

And yeah‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs one of those things you don‚Äôt necessarily fully understand until you‚Äôre there, I think. It doesn‚Äôt help that you were struggling with addiction at the time, which just complicates it so much more on top of how you feel about them being bad people. But whether you choose to report it or not‚Äîthe decision you make is valid as long as it‚Äôs the right decision for you. Going through the process can often be as traumatic as what you went through, in its own ways. For some people, it‚Äôs worth it. For some it‚Äôs not. If you decide that it‚Äôs not for you, there‚Äôs no shame in making that decision for yourself.

I know it‚Äôs a common fear that partners will view you that way upon learning of your assault‚Ä¶ but you say he tried to save you? I assume you went through a lot more, not necessarily sexual of course but painful, traumatic. If he‚Äôs been there with you through that and what he knew of it‚Ä¶ I think it‚Äôs worth opening up to him. But do so on your own time, when you‚Äôre ready, okay? Don‚Äôt force yourself to immediately lay it all out if you need some time to stew on it, but also don‚Äôt let yourself drive your own mind crazy over thinking it. 

You‚Äôve already escaped your past by virtue of getting sober, of getting out of that life. That takes *so much strength.* What you experienced and the period you were an addict doesn‚Äôt define you, and you‚Äôll get through this too. You just have to take care of you right now.",1,,2024-12-18 17:15:41,t1_m2o56vs,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hh2236/i_found_out_today_that_i_was_drugged_and_raped/m2oojc6/
1hh6gwb,post,Was I sexually assaulted or was it just bad sex and I'm being dramatic?,"I'm a woman who lost my virginity at 19 to another woman, who was 34. I met her through a friend at a party. We kissed at the party, and she started touching me intimately without my prior consent. I pulled her hand away, but throughout the night she kept cornering me to kiss me, which began to annoy me.

After the party, my friend and I were supposed to sleep at her place. She suggested I sleep in her room (and foolishly, I agreed). She was very drunk and went to bed before me. I decided to change into my pajamas in another room to avoid giving her the wrong idea, but I could sense she had ulterior motives. I was a virgin, and the situation made me extremely anxious.

When I lay down beside her, I tried to stay as far away as possible, but she woke up and began kissing me and touching me again. I never told her to stop verbally, but I kept moving her hands away. Still, she pressed her body onto mine, pinning me beneath her.

Feeling nervous, ashamed of being a 19-year-old virgin, and afraid I'd never have another chance, I gave in to her advances. I let it happen because I didn't feel desirable and feared being alone forever. Even after I gave in, she kept touching me in ways that made me uncomfortable, while not letting me touch her at all- which felt incredibly hypocritical.

I was trapped beneath her as she did whatever she wanted without asking for my consent. This included slapping me and choking me, things I never agreed to. At some point, I was so uncomfortable, but unable to ask her to stop, that I faked an orgasm just to end the whole ordeal. It was torturous.

The next morning, she proudly showed my friend the marks she left on me.

I went home crying and spent months unable to feel desire for anyone. To this day, I blame myself for giving in and not saying no more firmly. I'd always heard that sex between women is supposed to be amazing, but this experience was completely disrespectful.

I also rarely hear other lesbian women talking about this kind of situation, which makes me feel so alone sometimes.",5,7.0,2024-12-18 17:17:23,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hh6gwb/was_i_sexually_assaulted_or_was_it_just_bad_sex/

1hh7udx,post,I just can‚Äôt take it anymore,"Hi everyone, I have been struggling to deal with a situation involving my uncle which has been going on for as long as I can remember. He has constantly violated my boundaries and personal space on multiple occasions and made me feel extremely uncomfortable and disgusted.
He is 40+ and lives with my grandma and grandad, which makes it extremely difficult to visit them/interact with them. Especially as my grandma takes his side in everything- he has been babied his whole life and can‚Äôt do anything or live on his own without them.
Recently I made the decision to cut him off and block contact but this has led to further issues with family members who are on his side and think I am making this up. Please can anyone offer some advice on how to deal with this situation? It really overwhelms me especially when people in my own family call me a liar. I feel unheard, empty, used, abused‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. and I don't know where to go or what to do anymore. My life has been so so difficult already. I just don't know what to do anymore‚Ä¶..

This is a summary of what he has done over the years (translated from German, sorry for any bad English):

1) Moans my name in the toilet/screams my name
2) Unopened bra straps when I wake up at grandma's in the morning - NEVER HAPPENED ANYWHERE ELSE and certainly not completely, T-shirt was lifted up to my stomach!!!
3) Pinched my butt from behind
4) Harassing words
5) Always tries to go somewhere alone with me
6) Despite angrily saying over and over again that I don't want to be attacked, there is still physical contact (thighs, etc.)
7) Constantly texts me, ignores that I don't want physical contact and constantly tries to seek my proximity.
8) Insists on being alone with me and repeatedly ignores my boundaries, even when I clearly tell him that I don't want physical contact.
9) Enters my grandparents' bedroom even when I'm changing and telling him to stay outside.
10) Watching me at night when I stay at grandma's; stops in the hallway, stares at me in the dark and laughs.
11) Uses my PC without permission and adds me to platforms like Steam without permission.
12) Is always at home and often interrupts my conversations and calls, often with unpleasant or sexual topics. He invites himself into the conversation and joins in without me wanting to.
13) Often talks about women and sexual stories that make me very uncomfortable and forces me to listen to such conversations.
14) Stares at my body and reads out loud what is written on my clothes to look at my breasts.
15) Often makes sexual insinuations or lewd comments about me and my body.
16) Sits near me, e.g. while eating, and touches me even though I don't want him to.
17) Touches me inappropriately on my shoulders, back or other parts of my body, despite my clear rejection.
18) Regularly makes sexual jokes or comments, especially when we are alone.
19) Often stares at my breasts, butt and other parts of my body, which makes me feel uncomfortable.
20) Says things like ""That's my *my name*"" and acts as if he has a claim on me.
21) Denies his behavior and never apologizes, no matter how often I bring it up.
22) Threatened to hurt me several times.
23) Ignores my boundaries and continues to physically harass me despite clear instructions, e.g. by touching my thighs and back.
24) Showed me an inappropriate site/app where you can buy people as ""pets"" when I was a teenager (under 14)
25) Makes comments when I was wearing a choker and calls me a ""dominatrix"" several times in different situations
26) Whenever I say ""I love you"" to grandma/grandpa, he says ""I love you too"" even though he's not the one he's talking about
27) If I'm not sitting next to him but someone else, he touches that person several times
28) Tries to write me something that I HAVE to respond to, looks for reasons to write to me
29) Sends me unwanted selfies of himself
30) Recently messaged me with a picture of a hamster after I went no contact with him (he uses ‚Äòhamster/hamster cheeks‚Äô as an unwanted nickname for me.)",2,2.0,2024-12-18 18:16:36,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hh7udx/i_just_cant_take_it_anymore/

1hh87qb,post,am i overreacting?,"i am 18 and just finished my first quarter of college. i failed my math class by less than 2% and it sent me into a breakdown last night. at first it was because of the class itself. i never liked math ever since i was in middle school. so failing that class brought me back to middle school where i was constantly sexually harassed by another student from ages 12-14. then i realized that math reminds me of being bullied and harassed. my body felt gross and i couldn‚Äôt stop crying to the point i gave myself a sinus headache. i kept remembering middle school and how i never ‚Äúhealed‚Äù and now im stuck with mental health issues. my girlfriend said it sounds like i had a PTSD episode.

the thing is, i felt like i was overreacting. that i was never raped, just touched and heard inappropriate comments so therefore i shouldn‚Äôt be behaving like this. that its just learned helplessness and its stupid that this happened over a math class. but it stopped being about that math class a long time ago. 

i just felt confused and gross. i dont feel ready to tell my mom and therapist. i still feel like im overreacting. only my friends know and my girlfriend. is this normal? am i looking for attention?

m2pa2eo,comment,,"Everything you described is the behavior of a sexual predator. I‚Äôm sorry your family isn‚Äôt believing you or taking this seriously, because it is very serious. If you are forced to be around him, try to keep your phone out and record him. If he asks why, tell him so you can prove he‚Äôs a creepy predator. If he touches you, try to scream at the top of your lungs. This might be difficult because freezing is a common response to being in this type of danger, but if you can make a big scene he might stop. Yell things like ‚ÄúI told you not to touch me!‚Äù Or ‚ÄúWhy are you always trying to get me alone?‚Äù Make it known any time he follows you somewhere, or even turn around and return to the group. If asked why, tell them it‚Äôs because Uncle keeps following you and it makes you uncomfortable. 

You don‚Äôt list your age but if you are a minor you can tell a trusted adult outside your family like a teacher, school counselor, a friend‚Äôs parents. Right now your uncle is testing your boundaries and seeing how much he can get away with, both in terms of if you will tell anyone and if your loved ones will believe you.

It‚Äôs probably hard for your family to accept that their loved one is a predator but he is and they need a wake up call. You are not doing anything wrong by trying to protect yourself and you shouldn‚Äôt stop. It isn‚Äôt fair that you have to deal with this but your safety is more important than anyone‚Äôs hurt feelings.

I'm going on a citytrip coming weekend with a 'new' guy I'm seeing (I've phrased it like that because I've known him for almost 6 years now but we recently started dating). Which is very fun, ofcourse but I have not done the deed with anyone else since being assaulted almost 2 years ago. Now I'm kind of panicking because I really want to but I'm afraid I'll have a flashback and panick attack. He doesn't know it happened to me and I feel anxious bringing it up since he doesn't know a whole lot about my past.. I have a hard time opening up to new people but I like him a lot so I don't want to mess this weekend up by panicking... It's been fine with my ex but he knew about what happened so I could open up to him about it.

I'm so sorry if this is not structured in any way and I feel silly asking for advice but I feel safe in this sub since I've been reading through it and it has helped me before. ",1,1.0,2024-12-18 20:03:51,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hhacm2/in_desperate_need_of_advice/

Is this because of my childhood trauma? Is it common to just not have one due to that stuff in early childhood? I feel like there‚Äôs so much wrong and disgusting with my body because of that man.

When it does tear it can be painful, and bleed. It can also be torn from masturbation, tampons, menstrual cups etc etc, it‚Äôs not something that symbolises ‚Äúvirginity‚Äù.  The when, if, and how of it all, while it may be important to you, it does mean nothing.

You are not less, or disgusting.
I myself was assaulted at 8, and went through a spiral about similar, especially during my first relationship.

1hhd272,post,Closest guyfriend defended his friend who did it to me years ago,"I have a close friend (who I will call A), we grew up together, our families are close, and we have a history together (I had a crush on him for a long time but we never really dated officially or anything). He was always a grade older (I am 20f now, he is 21m). Our history is kinda complicated but he has always been close and supportive even if there have been some difficult things with him.

This happened four years ago, I was with him and his friend who I will call D. D is the same age as A, we grew up in the same area and same schools. A had told me D was interested in me, I had told him I didn‚Äôt think I was.

When it happened, the three of us were at D‚Äôs house. A said he was going back to his place to grab some of his things, and that left me alone with D. We were playing video games alone, he had sat next to me. He was talking and then had leaned in to kiss me, I had pulled back and tried to say I didn‚Äôt want that, he had pushed himself on top of me and had groped me and really aggressively forced his hands in my jeans. I have always struggled with what happened because I didn‚Äôt CLEARLY say no, but I was struggling and never felt like I consented.

A had come back, I wanted to pretend nothing had happened, but it felt like he knew. I told him later, he acted surprised and I said I never wanted to be around D again, and all three of us never hung out together. A distanced himself from D (they kinda got in a fight over it), he would say he shouldn‚Äôt have done it, but the way he talked about it he also would blame me for not pushing back more. 

Now the present, I have been hanging out with A again. He was talking about D and I tried to remind him I didn‚Äôt want to talk about him. He has said he feels like he is different and what happened before was an accident. I felt extremely angry but didn‚Äôt know how to say it. I feel like A has gotten more dismissive over what happened, and has been closer to D again, and that is really upsetting.

1hhg14d,post,I think i might‚Äôve gotten SA‚Äôed but im not sure ‚ö†Ô∏è TW DETAILED SA ‚ö†Ô∏è,"Hi so today something happened to me and my best friend said he thinks it is SA but i'm not sure. Sorry if this is poorly written or hard to follow i'm a mess as this only happened like 5 hours ago and i'm only
15. Also this is a throwaway account be my partner has my main. VERY MUCH TW. Only read this if you're in the right mindset and take care of yourself üíú

Okay so me (just turned 15 F) and my boyfriend (14 M) were hanging out today. We have been dating for almost 11 months btw. We're highschoolers and as yk highschoolers do. One of us was horny. It was not me. Anyways my bf was like ""can I finger you?"" and, me being a people pleaser, was like ""how bad do you want it? he is a teenage boy and is always horny. he said ""Very badly."" so I was ""okay ig"" bc yk I wanted to make him happy. So he did. He started fingering me and after a minute I really didn't want him to anymore. So I held up an X with my arms and signaled for him to stop. (I am autistic and go nonverbal in uncomfortable situations so that's all I could do at the time.) Well um, he said ""do you want me to stop?"" | said ""Mmhm"" and nodded my head yes. He didn't stop. He started going harder and faster. So l started sobbing. He stopped when I started crying. I sat up and just started crying super hard.
He backed up and was like ""can i hug you?"" and i was to busy sobbing so he just put his hand on shoulder. After about a minute he hugged me ar. started profusely apologizing. At this point he hadn't asked me a single time if I was okay or not. It was just ""I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry."" and then HE started crying.

After when I got home I started feeling super guilty and talking to my best friend of multiple years about it. He was supporting me and asking if I was okay or not. WHICH MY BF STILL HADNT DONE.

Now I feel super guilty like I was over reacting??? I feel like I shouldn't have cried and I should've just let him keep going. I don't even know anymore. We talked about it and he apologized and said he'll never do it again. I trusted him though and he kinda broke it. Also he started being like ""i'm a horrible person. i'm sorry. i shouldn't live anymore. Idk what's wrong with me."" which i love him but it was annoying me be he like actually traumatized me and now he's acting like the victim?

I don't know if this post is allowed in this sub or not. I'm sorry if it's not. I didn't know where else to put it.

I guess what i'm looking for out of this post is people to tell me if this actually counts as SA or anything or if i'm just overreacting. well thank y guys if you made it this far. Take care of yourse. and always remember that is someone says no, you don‚Äôt have consent üíú

Edit: I forgot to mention but the situation didn‚Äôt really make me feel uncomfortable. It made me feel violated? Violated is the best word i can use. Like that he did that to me just violated my being. I trusted him and he violated that and me.",4,6.0,2024-12-19 00:18:49,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hhg14d/i_think_i_mightve_gotten_saed_but_im_not_sure_tw/

1hhgjf5,post,I 17f has let a guy from church 29m rape me twice and I'm scared to stop him,"This started months ago. I don't really have friends and I started hanging out with this guy a few months before this started. We would go in the sound room and chat. One day he told me he has this problem with pain if he doesn't cum often he said this while pulling himself out and I froze. He used my hand to get himself off and I let him. He did this twice over a month.  
Then he came to me a few weeks later and said he wanted to ""thank"" me for my help by figuring me. I said no but he kept pushing. I told him about SA that happened to me when I was younger. I was crying and he just told me to cry on his shoulder while he did it.  
The next week I was going to talk to him and tell him I no longer feel comfortable being around him. I thought he was understanding but then he locked the door and was angry. I had never seen him angry before. He raped me.  
Last Saturday he said if I don't do what he wants he'll tell my whole church that I'm a whore and I'm going to hell. I panicked and went with him. I just laid there and let him do it again.

1hhhpmb,post,I just can‚Äôt pick myself back up after abuse,"I just can‚Äôt pick myself back up after abuse

I was in a toxic relationship for almost two years where I was raped and manipulated and I was finally able to escape and break away about 6 months ago‚Ä¶

While that original dose of freedom was amazing, nothing has felt the same‚Ä¶I‚Äôm ashamed of myself, of my body‚Ä¶I hate the person I‚Äôve become and it‚Äôs probably because over the course of that relationship I changed so much, trying to do anything to hold it together‚Ä¶and I despise the person that I have become‚Ä¶

Half of the days I can‚Äôt even discern my feelings or how I am feeling, I‚Äôm more easily irritable and I feel like I‚Äôm such an asshole to my friends even though they say I‚Äôm not and I feel like I‚Äôm basically pathetic if I don‚Äôt have a routine to follow

I have this stupid need, this craving for intimacy, for a partner to love me and for a good relationship and I hate it‚Ä¶I have such good friends and I feel so selfish that I just can‚Äôt be happy with that alone because they are truly amazing‚Ä¶I feel like I‚Äôve become a shallow asshole when I think about having a partner because I‚Äôm just so nervous to end up with someone like my ex again‚Ä¶

It got so pathetic I was searching for attention from guys in my pms so that I could hear someone say that I‚Äôm pretty, that I‚Äôm kind‚Ä¶but of course it‚Äôs not enough and I ended up deleting that account without a trace because I don‚Äôt want to get stuck in that kind of loop especially knowing it‚Äôs wrong.

This problem isn‚Äôt helped by my mother who is constantly hounding me and on my case about me finding a boyfriend or if I‚Äôm keeping my mind open or if I‚Äôm ‚Äúputting myself out there‚Äù it‚Äôs to the point where she wants it desperately from me and it hurts‚Ä¶her and I have drifted already due to religious differences and now this‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs proud of me‚Ä¶ 

I don‚Äôt think of myself as being desirable or lovable ever again and I know that‚Äôs pathetic‚Ä¶I know that you have to work on yourself before it gets better but I don‚Äôt know how‚Ä¶I really do just feel stuck‚Ä¶",0,1.0,2024-12-19 01:42:42,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hhhpmb/i_just_cant_pick_myself_back_up_after_abuse/

I am currently looking up a therapist but have also scheduled a meet up with their mothers to go over this situation. I just can‚Äôt believe it was dropped or nothing else was ever questioned. 

I need guidance on how to handle the next steps with my nephews. Do I ask them about the situation?, (I don‚Äôt want to humiliate them or bring those feelings of shame) but I desperately want to help them.

I'm also disabled. I can still walk, but I can't bend, sit down, or even lay on my back. I can't work either. Anyway, I'm still recovering from surgeries. I'm still cleaning up the blood. It was oral rape, but it severely damaged my surgical site. I'm scared to see my woundcare Dr tomorrow. Why did I do this to myself? Why did I let him back in? I'm still having flashbacks to my childhood SA as well. Any advice is great. I'm still numb. I'm shaking, bleeding, and in shock. I think I've got the blood under control. I'm afraid to tell my therapist because I told her I'd put him out of my life. Why did I allow this to happen? I simply froze when it started happening. I don't even remember anything about it and it just happened. All I remember is him touching me and nothing else after. Just him walking out the door however long later. I don't want to report it. I don't want to have to explain it in detail because I can't remember the details. Just the before and after. That's all I remember. I just want to end it all. I'm tired of being abused...he fucking took advantage of me because of my physical situation. And I let him. I let him in. I just want to crawl into a cave and let bears tear me apart. I've been in therapy for years because of my childhood SA. I know this is long, but what makes it even worse is he knew about my childhood SA.

This is not your fault.

You need to go to the ER RIGHT NOW. Stop cleaning yourself off, and get a rape kit done. It is going to be unpleasant, but it is the only way to get this sh1tbag called to count.

However, if you decide NOT to report, that's OK too. Just remember to keep him out of your life in the future. I'm betting that he will at least try to come back.

1hhjuqg,post,I was 17 the first time. 22 the second time. Today Im 24 and it feels like the assault just happened yesterday. But I‚Äôm still not sure if it was assault.TW for possibly graphic descriptions/domestic abuse,"It was my (f) first time.(I was 17 at the time, 24 now) I‚Äôd been dating an older guy who had been off in boot camp for 6 months, he was 2 years older than me. We met when I was 15, he was 17 at the time, so at the time of this he vent occuring I was 17 and he was 19. The silly thing is we both have the same birthday, and in my naive mind before the assault and before I‚Äôve put a lot of other pieces together to understand that what I went through wasn‚Äôt a relationship at all. And rarely was I shown respect. Or love. My body was treated like a thing for him to use as he saw fit.

He would yell. He would throw things. He would accuse me of cheating.

I thought I was ready. But the way it happened was all wrong. He never asked what was okay. I stayed rigid on my knees until he was finished.

‚Äú4 minutes and 13 seconds, huh sorry I couldn‚Äôt last longer‚Äù

Those 4 minutes and 13 seconds were some of the most painful things I‚Äôve ever experienced. I remember wanting to cry. But I couldn‚Äôt. I stumbled off the bed. Looked down. And realized that my thighs were covered in blood. It was dripping out of me. I wasn‚Äôt on my period. It was from what he did.

He did this and he didn‚Äôt think to stop. To see if I was okay. He used me for 4 minutes and 13 seconds. And these memories have lasted until today.

Afterwards he told me to take a shower because I looked ‚Äúgross‚Äù.

There was no aftercare. No consent given. He just did it. And I remember feeling really weird and unable to describe my emotions.

There was another time a few months after that. He was giving me a back massage. He started to take off my pants and I asked him what he was doing. He told me not to worry about it. Maybe 5-10 minutes pass and the next thing I know his hands are on my back, pinning me down, I can‚Äôt move. He‚Äôs inside of me. No protection. Once again no asking. I plead with him to get off of me, and that if he wants to continue it‚Äôs fine he just needs to put a condom on. He refuses. Says that he has it under control. He continues for a few minutes longer before pulling out, flipping me around to face him. Hand on my throat. He finishes on my stomach.

He didn‚Äôt ask.

And for some reason every time the day of that first time comes around every year I think about it. Over and over again. It loops in my head.

That wasn‚Äôt even the last guy to do something like this to me.

2 years ago I was getting help from a friend who helped me drive home (I went to college out of state). He flew out and helped me drive home. When he got off the plane and got into my car he kissed me. I remember being shocked. But not knowing what to do, because it was just a kiss right? And if I freaked out what if he didn‚Äôt help me drive home? The next day we reach our halfway point in the drive. Let it be noted he continually tried to touch my body whilst I was driving or while he was driving. I said no. I would shove his hands away. They always returned. We reach a national landmark, we went out to walk some trails but he wasn‚Äôt interested, said he wanted to go back to the hotel room. I obliged. I needed to get this trip over with. Yet here I was. Either stuck alone with this man in a car or a hotel. It didn‚Äôt matter.

We get back to the hotel. He says he has condoms and that he would like to have sex. I‚Äôm overwhelmed at this point by the amount of times I‚Äôve shown him that I‚Äôm not interested, I say okay. I let him do it. In the moment I remember hoping this would satiate him. That if I just gave him what he wanted he would stop touching me in the car, stop trying to kiss me.

The sex was painful. He was too big. I wasn‚Äôt prepared. I bled.

I spent the rest of the night in the other queen bed of the hotel. Completely shut down and trying to figure out why I was feeling so disconnected.

From the day we reached my hometown to the day he left 28 days later to go back to his house, his need for sex was constant. It would happen multiple times a day. There was no kissing. There was no gentleness. I would tell him I wasn‚Äôt ready, that I needed time to get comfortable. He would do it anyways, always for his own pleasure. I kept telling myself that maybe this was love. He said he loved me. That he cared about me. But it never felt right.

About a week-2 weeks before he left I was joking around with him. I made some sort of joke about bdsm because I thought it was funny. He asks me if I would be interested in a specific bdsm thing. I don‚Äôt really know how to respond so I make a joke at his expense. I think I called him weak or something similar. The next thing I know his hands are on my shoulders, he turns me around to face him and he slaps me straight across the face. It was so powerful I stumble backwards. Shocked. I remember hoping it would bruise.

Things went back to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù after that. Him demanding sex, not caring about if I was having a good time. I remember it hurt every time. I hoped every time that it was be the last. I felt ashamed. My body responded in ways I wasn‚Äôt comfortable with. It would welcome him in and yet scream at me that this was wrong. That I didn‚Äôt want it. I think the worst thing is that he wouldn‚Äôt finish quickly, and to make matters worse, his refractory period was ridiculously slim. Sometimes I would get a 2-5 minute breather before he would be rubbing himself against me. I felt emotionally worn out. I felt used. I still feel that way sometimes. Like he‚Äôs still there, pinning me against the bed, not listening when I would ask him to slow down. We were in that house for 28 days together. I don‚Äôt think it would be too far off to say that he wanted some form of sex anywhere between 3-5 times a day. Sometimes when my mom would leave the house, or go to the bathroom he‚Äôd take it as his chance to touch me. One time I remember he pulled my shorts down and bit my thigh as hard as he could. I remember asking him to stop. My mother couldn‚Äôt have been gone for more than 6-8 minutes. In that time he had his way with me. There‚Äôs so much shame. Why didn‚Äôt I ever mention it to her. I was afraid that her knowing would hurt her more than what was actively being done to me.

One night. He was sleeping on the couch, I was in my bed. I was asleep. He got into my bed. He got ontop of me. I woke up. The clock read 2:42am. He started rubbing himself against my legs. His hand digging into my shoulder. I was frozen. I didn‚Äôt know what to do. I thought that if I was just quiet he would go away, if I didn‚Äôt move, he would lose interest. He hand brushed over my breast, he grabbed. It hurt. He kept rubbing himself against me. I think I‚Äôd gone to sleep in a shirt, running shorts, and underwear. He took off my shorts. I remember freezing up again, trying to lay still as stone. Trying to pretend I wasn‚Äôt there. He started touching me. Rough. As if my skin was something to be conquered.

He asks me why I‚Äôm not making noises. I look away from him. The clock reads 3:16am. He grabs my face in his hand. Forces me to look at him. He tells me I need to make noise. I lay there. He lets go of my face. And he slaps me hard across the face. Once. Twice. 
It feels as if my cheek is on fire. I feel tears going down my face. It was as if that first slap a week and a half ago was a test. To see how I would react. And here he was again. Wanting a reaction. Trying to rip it out of me. He grabs ahold of my face again. And he‚Äôs in me. Touching me. With no protection. I remember thinking about how much it practically burned. It was so dry. How could he not feel it? Why did he continue? He made me watch. I remember thinking about screaming out. But I couldn‚Äôt let my mom walk in on this. I couldn‚Äôt let her see this. It feels like it goes on forever. My body betrays me. Creates a welcoming environment for him. I hated it. The way he touched me. How it felt as though he would damage me beyond repair. 
 I kept lying there. I looked at the clock again. 4:02 am. I start to wonder if this is all just a bad dream. But he‚Äôs squeezing my breasts again. And it hurts. Dreams don‚Äôt hurt like this. I still wish to wake up. To prove myself wrong. Maybe I did want this. He had made me finish once. I try not to think about it. Because maybe it means I did enjoy it. But anytime I think of him I feel as if I‚Äôm on the brink of vomiting.

Were there occurrences of assault? If my body responded positively at some point while my mind was crying out no, is it not my fault? It still feels like it is. And I‚Äôm not sure if I can ever tell my mom what happened. I told her about the first time. With the first guy. And she asked me how I could let something like that happen to me. Because she had always taught me to stand up for myself and now she wasn‚Äôt a good enough mother because she let the abuse occur under her roof.

This new situation. This new guy. It was under her roof. I was in a different bed than the first guy, but I felt the same. It had happened again. And it really feels like it was all my fault.

Do the memories ever fade? Why do they feel so fresh? Does it ever hurt less?",1,4.0,2024-12-19 03:35:22,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hhjuqg/i_was_17_the_first_time_22_the_second_time_today/

1hhljji,post,Advice,"I need to talk this out. A few weeks ago I was out with friends at our local bar for blackout Wednesday and I got super drunk.  Keep in mind I have a long distance boyfriend. It was the night before thanksgiving so i ran into an ex boyfriend that was in town that I had not seen in several years but we previously dated on and off for about five years (he was very emotionally abusive in our relationship / lots of cheating), we were talking briefly about life updates and what not. At the end of the night (I do not remember anything after this, this is what is told to me by my friend) my friend was going to uber me home and as she went to do it, my ex boyfriend said no I will uber home with her so she is not in the uber alone, and then go home. She said she asked me if this would be okay and she said I said yes. Next thing I know I am in his bedroom with my clothes off. And I was awoken by him trying to have sex with me. I was in complete shock and did not know what to do. I pretended to go back to sleep after telling him I did not want to have sex and he continued to go down on me. Next thing I remember I was telling him I needed to go and he drove me home. The next day he had texted me about how I was feeling (hangover) and we texted a little, until he asked me to hangout to which I said no.   I then told my boyfriend about what happened to which he broke up with me for cheating and we are still no longer talking. Talking with my therapist, I am now realizing I was not in the mindset to consent. He took advantage of me while being super intoxicated. This was someone who I thought I trusted and it is still hard for me to process that he did this to me. There are a lot more details I can get into but this is an overview. Should I reach out to my most recent boyfriend and tell him about what happened? Do I confront the EX who took advantage of me? I want to know what advice / path I should take going forward. I am still blaming myself for getting myself that drunk. And I am still questioning whether this was sexual assault or just my fault for being that drunk.

1hhlwuj,post,What do I do next when my teen tells me about past SA?,"My almost 18yo daughter just told me about a period of repeated SA by a close family friend when she was 9 and he was 12. I am contacting her therapist (at DD‚Äôs request) to give her the heads up that she wants to talk about this next session. I have told her it isn‚Äôt her fault and she has nothing to feel guilt or shame for, etc. Believe me I am doing everything I can for her mental health. It has been a journey, and I feel like this has come up now (she said she didn‚Äôt really think much about it until the last few months) because she has been dealing with so many other things she has to finally get it all out and dealt with. She didn‚Äôt really understand at the time that it was SA since there was no penetration involved, but is now realizing that even over the clothes touching that made her uncomfortable is wrong.

I just don‚Äôt know what to do next. This family is our best friends and the son in question doesn‚Äôt live with them and is out of the country for a year. The SA didn‚Äôt continue past those ages, and DD says she still enjoys going to their house and being friends with the rest of the family, but understandably feels uncomfortable every time the one child (now adult) is mentioned or present (not very often, but still).

m2sdbku,comment,,"I grew up in a very strict Christian family with the same beliefs about ‚Äúpurity‚Äù and sex before marriage. I absolutely understand your fear about telling someone and how you‚Äôre scared it could be used against you. And, if I‚Äôm being completely honest, if your church is as backwards as mine was, it could be. I‚Äôm assuming the boy would defend himself by saying it was all your idea, you seduced him, blah blah blah, and how certain people might believe him. Or, not!! Maybe he has other victims that would come forward. Maybe people have a bad sense about him and this would just be confirmation that something is seriously seriously wrong with him, and they would band together around you to support you through it like they should (like any TRUE Christian would!).

But honestly, none of that initial chaos really matters either way. You will get through it, and you WILL find people who will believe you and will support you.

What is important right now is getting you safe. You are being repeatedly sexually assaulted, and that needs to stop right now. You need to use your best judgement and chose what adult or adults you‚Äôre going to confide in. If it‚Äôs your parents, wonderful. If it‚Äôs a school counsellor, or a doctor at a hospital, or your pastor, they will support you in telling the other people who need to know. KEEP telling adults until someone believes you and does something about it.

You are not at fault here. You have done nothing wrong, biblically or otherwise. Sending you strength ‚ù§Ô∏è

1hhnno2,post,I wish people knew the truth about my ‚Äúgreat guy‚Äù ex. (TW: Mentions of injury and blood.),"It‚Äôs been a few months since my ex (25m) and I (23f) broke up but I‚Äôm just now realizing the sexual trauma he caused me. One day, my now-ex and I planned to go to a hotel to have sex, but when the day came, he was yelling at me ‚Äî even though he knows it's a trigger for me ‚Äî and he ditched me for hours to hang out with another friend. We went to the hotel after he came back, but after the way he treated me, I didn‚Äôt feel like doing anything. Instead I confronted him about what happened that day and he apologized, but immediately after our talk, he said ‚ÄúWell I guess that means we‚Äôre not having sex.‚Äù I felt guilty and I immediately told him that we could have sex to avoid making him feel hurt or feel like we ""came all this way for nothing."" I was clearly uncomfortable, but I went along with it and just wanted to get it over with.

He was super rough when we had sex this time and when he finally got tired and stopped, he realized I was heavily bleeding (I thought it was my hymen but after researching, he definitely tore something.) He freaked out from the blood and I was trying to calm him and myself down while looking for something to stop the bleeding. Then he started laughing and asking ‚Äúare you alright?‚Äù with the biggest smile on his face. I had to yell at him to get me a pad and he finally got up and went to the front desk to get one. When I cleaned up everything he joked and said ‚ÄúWell at least you‚Äôre a woman now!‚Äù I left the next morning without saying a word to him, but our relationship continued for another four months after that as if nothing happened. Throughout the relationship, he also flashed me whenever he was feeing horny/ brought up how horny he was, even if I was in the middle of a serious conversation with him.

It took me a long time to realize this was coercion and manipulation because of his ""golden retriever"" persona. Everyone thinks he‚Äôs a great guy because he's a social butterfly and he has a lot of friends. I believed it too because there were points in our relationship where he was so sweet to me ‚Äî he treated me to dinner a lot, listened when I told him about my trauma, and he even helped me to pursue my passions. He‚Äôs also the kind of guy who doesn‚Äôt completely understand social cues, which is probably why he didn‚Äôt understand that I was actually very uncomfortable with having sex with him ‚Äî for a long time I also blamed myself for saying yes, knowing that he probably wouldn‚Äôt have been able to pick up on how uncomfortable I was.

Now that I‚Äôve realized how absolutely not normal his behavior was, I wish I could tell his friends what happened, but I‚Äôm too scared to say anything without any evidence. It sucks because any friends that we had in that relationship all sided with him and they haven‚Äôt reached out to me at all ‚Äî one friend went out of their way to say that they ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt want to know‚Äù about the details of our breakup, which hurt. I really wish there was something I can do to show everyone that my ex isn‚Äôt the ‚Äúgreat guy‚Äù that we all thought he was.",11,5.0,2024-12-19 07:31:15,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hhnno2/i_wish_people_knew_the_truth_about_my_great_guy/

1hhnzkz,post,I tried to forgive my ex for assaulting me and he left anyways,"I've been debating whether to post this or not. I don't even know if this is the right place for my story. I just feel broken and low. For this story, I'm going to be using fake names, just to preface. I (22F) dated my now ex, Jake (23M), for about seven months. We had met through Bumbl. We talked for about 2-3 weeks through text before meeting in person. We met near the end of March and made it official only five days after meeting irl for the first time. The relationship moved pretty fast. It felt like we both fell for each other really fast with how often we talked leading up to meeting in person for the first time, so it didn't scare me too much when Jake said he loved me 6 days after meeting in person for the first time, just a day after officially becoming bf/gf. To the point, I felt like I fell for him pretty hard too and now, I feel sort of stupid and naive for a lot of this story. I had never been intimate with anyone before and gone all the way. My ex before Jake, we never went all the way and I was of the mind that if I waited until marriage with that ex, maybe having sex would feel okay, so I never did anything. With Jake, I lost my virginity to him and gave myself to him just a week after meeting him in person for the first time and felt like I was truly falling in love with him. He even took me to take Plan B afterwards because I was so nervous having sex for the first time even though I'm on the pill and he used a condom. I just felt sort of nervous, but I trusted him. He just felt so safe and comforting. I grew up in a devout Catholic household, so I felt sort of sexually repressed growing up because I taught that those kinds of things were wrong, so after having sex with Jake for the first time, I felt almost liberated and happy and confident. I felt good about myself, so I took that as a sign that Jake and I were good for each other. From there on, we had a talk about kinks and what the other person may like to try. Jake said he wanted to have unprotected sex and just feel close to me without the condom. I expressed that I wasn't ready for that yet and he understood. Our sex life felt loving and safe. There was a lot of times that I would give him kind, loving, sweet words when we were intimate because I just wanted him to know how much I loved him, how happy he made me, how I love being around him, that he was just super amazing. A lot of the times when I'd say things like that and we were having sex, he would say how he wished he could be ""raw"" inside of me and I always expressed that I wasn't ready for that yet and he would drop the topic. We eventually planned for a vacation for the two of us to go to Philadelphia right at the end of summer. Jake was a huge Arsenal fan, so, we bought tickets for the Arsenal vs Liverpool match on July 31st in Philly and set up the plans for our trip. We were going to be gone from July 28th to August 3rd. It was about a 14 hour trip and we took turns driving the entire time. Once we got to the Airbnb we were staying at and unpacked, we started making out. We stopped for a second and I told him that I knew how much it meant to him to have unprotected sex, but I just wasn't ready for that and I'd only really feel okay with it if I took Plan B, but I didn't want to have to do that and deal with a heavy flow on my period and deal with the effects of that pill, and I apologized for not being comfortable with what he wanted yet. He said I had no reason to apologize and we started having sex. At some point, we changed positions so he could be behind me. It seemed like he was taking quite a while to lube himself up before reinserting. He put it back in and I saw him put something that looked like rubber under the pillow. I tried to move the pillow, curious as to if it was what I thought it was. He moved the pillow back before I could get the chance to look underneath. It was maybe anywhere from at least 30 seconds to maybe an upwards of 2 minutes that he was inside me in this position. The entirety of that time, I was questioning what was going on, wondering if Jake could be capable of ""stealthing"". I eventually asked him if he was raw and he nonchalantly said he was. I immediately pulled away and started hysterically screaming and crying. He immediately stood up and just stared at me in shock, frozen. I started crying, saying I wanted my mom. After it happened, I felt so stupid and just wanted to be at home with my mom, having her comfort me. I had to yell at him to get Plan B because he stayed sort of frozen, almost unsure of what to do. Before he left to the store, I had asked him, ""are we gonna be okay?"" almost unsure of whether this was the end of us. He responded, ""I don't know. I just raped you,"" which only made me cry harder. In the time he was gone, I reached out to one of my friends and she just kind of comforted me and told me to do whatever I felt was right, whether it was leaving him, or staying with him and possibly getting couples' counseling. I wanted to tell my mom what had happened, but I was afraid that if I told her what happened, she'd fly me home and forbid me from ever being with Jake ever again and I loved him so much, I didn't want to lose him. When he came back, I was throwing up from stress and I told him that I didn't want to lose him, that what he did was extremely selfish and he shouldn't do something like that ever again, encouraging him to seek help to better understand why he did it, telling him that he broke my trust and needed to find a way to regain it. The next two days of the trip, I just cried a lot, crying for my mom, throwing up, unable to eat from stress. Two days after the incident, he reached out to my mom and said him and I had had a fight and he felt like it may help for me to hear from her. I kept arguing with him not to text her because I didn't want to lose him. He said it was fine with him if I told her what happened. My mom called me and I told her what happened. She didn't understand why it was wrong. She told me that when you're with someone, it shouldn't matter whether there's a condom or not, that at least you're close to that person and Jake just wanted to be vulnerable with me. I thought that him reaching out to my mom, knowing it could lead to us possibly breaking up may be enough to regain my trust. I just wanted us to go back to normal honestly. So much so, that I tried to reframe the assault and tell myself that Jake just wanted to be close to me, but went about it in the wrong way and made a little whoopsie. The rest of the trip, I just felt detached. I didn't want to go outside. I'd have panic attacks. We spent the rest of the trip mainly inside of the airbnb, cuddling, watching Ted Lasso. There was once that we were doing just that and Jake tried to make a joke, saying, ""Hey, for what it's worth, you felt really good"", referring to what he had done and I told him it wasn't the time to joke about it yet and he apologized. I realize now that I should've taken a break from intimacy. We had sex two days after the assault and I just kept spiraling further because I thought that if we had sex again, hopefully that would fix what I was feeling and I'd feel safe with him again. I don't know. I just didn't know what to do. When we came back from the trip, I spiraled into a really deep depression and started having frequent panic attacks. I immediately found myself a therapist and tried to deal with everything. Before Jake and I ever even met for the first time, I let him know that I had anxiety and very rarely have panic attacks, but I understood that that could be a lot for people and wanted to be upfront about it so he could leave if he didn't want to be around that. I was already seeing a psychiatrist at this point and was on a waitlist for therapy. He said it was admirable that I was seeking help for my mental health. He said how as long as I kept working on myself, he'd never leave. He said how his ex never sought out help when her dad died, she just relied on Jake to practically fix her and she didn't want to get better, that she'd just brush off the idea of therapy and it hurt him to watch her fall apart like that. I told him I didn't want to rely on him like that or see him as my cure. I was a pretty happy and bubbly person before the trip. After the trip, I got depressed and suicidal. I just lost motivation to exist. It felt like my body wasn't mine anymore. I dropped out of college. I could barely work anymore because I was constantly throwing up from stress, having panic attacks, crying, barely functioning. When I did work, I'd just be crying, having panic attacks, unable to eat, just sort of out of it. I was mentally so low that my boss even told me that they didn't care whether I actually did my job, they just wanted me to be around people, even if it meant just crying in the back of the store or playing on my phone, she just didn't want me to be alone. After the trip, we started having much more arguments. After the trip, we started having much more arguments. Anytime we had sex after the trip, I'd feel anxious that he was going to do it again, especially if he was behind me, but I tried to ignore that feeling, hoping that eventually it would just go away. In Philadelphia, it felt like my body wasn't my own, like I had no bodily autonomy, stripped of any dignity. After Philadelphia, I lost my motivation to simply exist. It felt like I had no purpose or reason to exist. Existing felt meaningless. I turned Jake into my reason to exist so at least I'd have something to keep me going. After the trip, even though I wasn't comfortable with it, I let Jake go without the condom more often, hoping that the more I let him do that, the less what happened on that trip would hurt. It didn't help. I didn't ever really tell Jake how bad I was handling the assault. I couldn't even call it assault. I told him it wasn't rape, just a breach of trust because it felt too surreal and scary to say rape and I didn't want that to be true. I didn't want it to be some big, devastating betrayal. I just wanted us back to normal. Before Philly, they had also upped my birth control, so I thought the feelings I was dealing with, the depression, anxiety, inability to really cope with happened, I thought it was just the birth control. There was always the tiniest part of me after the trip, that believed I was, in fact, raped, but I tried to ignore it and push it down. I told myself everything happens for a reason and the reason for what happened on that trip was to show that Jake and I could overcome absolutely anything. Anytime we argued, I just assumed it was my fault and I'd blame myself because it felt like I was ruining everything. I had a fear that Jake was going to leave, so sometimes, I'd push him away. Jake knew I had a problem with loud noises or being yelled at, so he had bought me some noise cancelling headphones early on for me to wear when he'd be gaming with his friends, so I wouldn't get overstimulated. We had an argument after the trip, where we were arguing because I had caught a cold and I asked if he still wanted me to come down and stay with him even though I was sick, or if he'd rather I come down once I was better so he wouldn't catch anything. He said he still wanted to see me, so I went down. I wanted cuddles and comfort, so, Jake started spooning me. I turned around and he was wearing a mask. I don't have anything against masks at all, but it did make me feel like maybe it was wrong of me to be there. It hurt my feelings and felt like I shouldn't be there. He said he couldn't afford to get sick, but still wanted to see me and be near me. I said I could just leave and go home and come back once I was better and I stated that it felt like he didn't actually want me around because I was sick, so maybe it would be better if I went home. He got so angry that he punched the wall and yelled at me to go. He had never yelled at me like that before. I started having a panic attack, crying hysterically and hid in his bathroom for 15-20 minutes because his yelling scared me. When I came out, he said maybe it was better that we're not together because I shouldn't be with someone who scares me like that. I said it was okay and forgave him and he promised to never do that again because of how bad it scared me, and again, I encouraged him to seek help so he could find better ways to handle his anger and frustration. He did keep doing it though. He'd sometimes go right outside the door of the apartment to yell and hit stuff, but that scared me just as much. Whenever he'd get angry in arguments, I'd immediately shut down and just start profusely apologizing for upsetting him. I started biting my tongue about certain things I felt because I didn't want to upset him. There was a lot of other stuff that happened in the relationship, I realize now that he wasn't very good about vocalizing his wants and needs and then it felt like he'd get frustrated that I didn't understand what he was wanting/needing to begin with. For example, there was one week I was supposed to stay with him from the Tuesday night of my birthday all the way until the following Monday when I worked again with him, at his apartment, and we had cleared our schedules from work so we could have that weekend together. There was one day that week that I dropped my car off at this mechanic that was a five minute walking distance from Jake's apartment. I dropped it off at noon and Jake said he'd take me to go get groceries and get something to eat once he came back from school since he hadn't done the grocery shopping. I agreed. I dropped my car off at noon and Jake came back from school at 12:30pm. He immediately went to his friends' apartment though and got groceries with them and got food to eat with them. I saw Jake's location and saw that he was at Chick-Fil-A. I asked him if he had gotten me something to eat. He said no because he assumed I wouldn't want any since I don't really care for Chick-Fil-A and that he'd just take me somewhere I like once he got back. Again, I agreed because I didn't have a car to go get food on my own and I didn't want to spend a lot on doordashing something. When he came back, he again went over to his friends' apartment. I asked how much longer he'd be. He said maybe 20-30 minutes because he was trying to fix his friend's PC. At this point, I had waited 4 hours for Jake to come back, from 12:30 pm to 4:30 pm and he still wasn't back. Out of frustration, I told him I was just going to start walking from his apartment to go get food. He said he'd immediately come pick me up in the car and take me to eat. I just kept walking and I got the call that my car was ready right as I was about to pass the mechanic. I got my car and Jake saw me in my car and he followed me and parked right next to me in the Taco Bell parking lot. He came over to my car and I was pretty angry and rude to him. He called me mean and selfish and walked off. I was shocked, so I got into his car since he was right next to me. He said that I shouldn't be with him because he was selfish and couldn't even be there for me, knowing I didn't have a ride. I said it was fine and he came with me to go get food. He said that he felt like he couldn't do his own things when I came down to visit and feels like he has to spend all of his time with me. I told him that I only really wanted anywhere between 30 minutes to 2 hours of us just doing something together without distractions, having quality time, the rest of the time, I didn't care what he did. If he wanted to go out with his friends for hours, sure go ahead. If he wanted to go to the gym for an hour or two, sure go ahead. If he wanted to spend hours gaming online with his friends, sure go ahead. I felt like I couldn't really talk about the things I wanted and had to bite my tongue about that too. I remember before our one month of dating, I had mentioned that it would mean a lot to me to be surprised with flowers from time to time. To celebrate our one month, we went to the botanical garden and then he took me to Lowe's to buy flowers that reminded us of each other that he could keep at his apartment. A few weeks afterwards, I mentioned how I would like to be surprised with flowers randomly and he called me unappreciative and didn't think him or his actions were enough for me because he had already taken me to Lowe's to get flowers. I apologize for this story being a bit out of order. Anyways, the last week of October, I was planning to stay Tuesday night until Sunday morning with him. Saturday that week he had work, so I slept in really late. When I woke up, he texted me asking if I could go home instead because he wanted to go out with his friends. I asked why it would be wrong for me to stay at the apartment alone by myself while he went out. He said he didn't like the idea of me being in the apartment alone for hours without him, but we had done that so many times, so I really didn't understand the issue. I thought it would help to just ask him about it on his work break, so I went to his job to talk to him on his break. It took him a while to finally just say he wanted the apartment to himself so he could decompress and have alone time once he was done hanging out with his friends. I got in my head and convinced myself that he was just tired of me and trying to get rid of me, trying to come up with different excuses to get rid of me. I expressed that feeling and he started shaking in anger and he punched his leg. I kept profusely apologizing and he said he didn't want to see me at all now. I went back to his apartment and started crying, throwing up, having panic attacks, fear of upsetting Jake, worried that he was going to leave me. I packed all of my thing and wrote a letter, expressing that I felt like I wasn't enough, that I was ruining everything, that I was selfish, that I didn't want to break up or lose him, but I didn't know how to fix things anymore. I had to take my nausea medicine and anxiety medication because of how bad I was doing once he said he didn't want to see me, knowing those two medications knock me out and I can't drive on them. I thought it would be fine since my friend lived nearby, so I just kind of assumed I'd be able to crash at her place for that night, and I feel dumb that I didn't check with her first. Jake came back before I finished leaving. He asked if I was leaving. I said I didn't want to, but I didn't know how to fix things. We went up to his apartment to talk. He said we just needed to talk and figure things out together. He read the letter and said we were fine. He said it was fine for me to stay the night with him. He went out with his friends three different times that night. Each time he came back, I'd be crying, beating myself up for writing the letter. Every time he saw me crying, he'd tell me I had nothing to be upset about, that we were fine. I expressed to him that night the feeling of not finding meaning to existing. The next morning, he couldn't look me in the eyes when I said I loved him before leaving. He said he just needed space and time. Monday night, I couldn't take it anymore, so I pushed him to give me an answer over whether we were over or not and he said we were over. With him leaving, it brought up repressed feelings of what happened on that trip as well as two other incidents. The second incident, it was right after the trip. I had drank a little to feel a little ""loose"", hoping it would help me get more in the mood for sex. After the trip, my sex drive wasn't really the same. I told Jake I wanted him to go in raw. He put it in and said, ""I'm inside you."" and then it all went black and I don't remember anything else. Part of me wonders if he kept going once I blacked out. The day afterwards, I asked if we had sex and he seemed sort of upset that I didn't remember, so that makes me believe that maybe he did keep going once I blacked out, but then later, he said he saw I wasn't conscious, so he stopped. I'm not sure which I believe. The third incident, I gave him a certain time slot where he could go without the condom and once I felt like I had enough and couldn't handle it anymore, I'd have him put the condom on. We had done it this way a few times. I asked him to put the condom on and he said, ""one more second."" He said it was miscommunication, that he was trying to ask, ""one more second?"" and assumed it was fine because I said okay, but when he said that, I said okay out of shock and shoved him off me. I don't know that I believe it to be miscommunication. But, with him leaving, it got bad for me mentally. I stopped eating and sleeping. Everything I ate, I threw up. He had told me that he felt like he no longer wanted the relationship back and said that he felt drained from the arguments and my mental health. He said he had never felt so much anger in his life until being with me. My therapist pointed out that it seemed like he was putting the responsibility of his anger onto me. She said that it seemed like I bit my tongue about how I felt at times out of fear of upsetting him. I reached out to him that day after therapy, hoping that if I tried to talk about how I felt about the assault to him, maybe it'd help me feel heard. Maybe it wasn't the right move. I asked him about what happened and he brought up that I said it wasn't rape right after it happened and said that he just made a mistake, but that was right after it happened that I said those things. I think I just wanted to convince myself it wasn't a big deal because I thought it would make it hurt less. I tried to lessen the weight of the assault, but it didn't help. That feeling of being used and taken advantage of never really went away. Mentally, I was good before the trip. I was a really happy girl. It hurts that she's gone. I recently just got out of the mental hospital because I felt like I was spiraling and unmotivated to do anything, even just exist. I felt like I was finally having to fully process the assault and how much of a toll it had taken on me. I couldn't make sense of why it happened. I felt like he had never taken accountability for that night. I was nervous to go to the mental hospital and even called Jake for support. He told me before I went in that I need to believe in myself and stand up for myself, even if it's against him. He told me he wants me to be happy. Just because I'm out of the mental hospital doesn't mean I'm all okay now. I had to go to the city Jake lives in, an hour away from me, to run an errand and get lunch with my friend and I got my stuff back that I had left at Jake's apartment from this friend. She was the mediator between us, he dropped it off with her and I got my things from her when I saw her. He had forgotten some of my things, my box of Malibu rum premixed canned cocktails that I had bought, my pajama shorts, and my tupperware. I texted him and asked about those things. He said he gave away my rum because it was taking up space. I asked him why he didn't check with me first since it wasn't his to give away. He said it was because I was in a mental hospital and I replied, ""yeah and why was that?"", referring to the assault. I passed by his apartment with my friend to get my tupperware. I think he threw my shorts out or gave them away. He said they weren't there. It felt weird seeing him because it felt like I didn't recognize him at all. He was just a stranger. I again started to spiral because I felt upset at the realization that Jake had gone out to party and have fun while I was in the mental hospital. It shouldn't bother me, but it felt distasteful. I had to go to the mental hospital because I was struggling to come terms with the assault. I started to feel upset that Jake just gets to live a normal, happy life, while I've been stuck with the mess, the trauma, all on my own. Later that night, I got to a really low point mentally and I self-harmed. I felt disgusting and gross. I felt so alone and so, I reached out to Jake, desperate for someone to be there. It was 2am, but I called him. He got mad at me for reaching out to him and said he didn't want to be there for me. He said he didn't care for the relationship or for me. He said he didn't want to be my friend or there for me at all because he felt like I had been really mean to him that day, with saying the assault was why I had to go to a mental hospital. He ended up blocking my number and my instagram. I feel like him blocking me made me feel even worse. I felt alone. I felt disappointed because it felt like the Jake that I talked to that night, that blocked me, is a stranger that I don't know. I say all of this to highlight the struggles of the relationship. I understand I made mistakes too, but the more I come to terms with what happened on that trip, I can't wrap my head around how Jake thought I was the mean one when I never even got an apology when he raped me. I hate that there's still a part of me that misses him. It hurts and makes me sick that no one in his life knows what he did to me on that trip. I just feel alone. I don't want to hurt anymore. I've been a mess. I've considered reaching out to one of his family members about the rape, desperate for him to change, wanting an apology or acknowledgement. Again, I understand that I wasn't perfect either, but I knew what I was messing up on and seeking help to better it. I had abandonment issues and so, I would try to push Jake away, so I tried to work hard on bettering that for him via therapy and psychiatry. I know this is all over the place and I'm sure I missed something somewhere. I don't know what to do to stop hurting. I keep questioning my own story, whether I'm overreacting, whether he's right that I was mean and maybe I am just a bad person undeserving of love. I've been gaslighting myself, wondering if maybe I'm misremembering things, forgetting details... I don't want revenge. I just want change and understanding from him and it hurts because with how he doesn't even seem to care about me now, I doubt that'll ever happen. I feel sick to my stomach, scared of another girl going through what I went through with him, whether it be the assault itself or him hitting the walls and getting angry the way he did. I don't know what to do to stop feeling this way, to stop fearing, to stop thinking about him, to stop wanting an apology. Everyone around me says that I'll find someone way better one day, someone that respects my boundaries, but honestly, the idea of dating ever again scares me. I'm scared of the next guy assaulting me too. I understand that my relationship with Jake was unhealthy. After he punched the wall and yelled at me the first time, I told one of my friends about it and she tried to encourage me to leave, scared that it was a sign of potential future abuse. I remember feeling like I couldn't leave, feeling like if Jake ever laid a hand on me, I wouldn't leave, that I would stay. I mean, I feel stupid and naive now because he raped me and I still stayed. It all hurts and I feel lost and alone. Again, I know I'm probably rambling and all over the place, this is still fresh, so I can clarify if there's any questions, I don't mind. I'm not sure if I'll keep this up for long as I still worry that maybe I am in the wrong and just overreacting. I don't know if I'm just missing something. It feels like I'm just stuck on what happened on that trip. I don't know how to move on, now that he's gone. When I see his pictures in my phone, it feels like I don't know him at all. In the picture, he's standing next to me, smiling, but I just see myself next to a stranger. But yeah, sorry for yapping, I don't know if I'll keep this up. I just feel stuck. I felt like in the relationship, I didn‚Äôt have a voice and now I‚Äôm trying to figure out what having a voice means for me. I don‚Äôt know whether to file a report against my ex as I still care deeply for him, even after everything, which has been driving me crazy. It feels like he took so much from me and I thought I could fix him with my love. He left and it makes no sense to me still why I still miss him. I don‚Äôt know how to figure out whether filing a report is the right move for me or not. I‚Äôve been to a few support groups and one woman mentioned that filing a report on her ex helped her separate herself from her ex, helping her realize she could never go back to her ex and that she would‚Äôve gone back to her ex in an instant if he just apologized. I feel like that‚Äôs where I am right now, that I‚Äôm just desperate for an apology for him and still miss him.

1hho4ym,post,question,"hi everyone i just found out i couldve been sexually assaulted three times and i didn‚Äôt even realize it.. i‚Äôm just very lost and sad about this and the realization was scary. the first time he didn‚Äôt put a condom on even though i had strict boundaries about it.. he just inserted himself without me knowing he was going to do it unprotected. i felt violated after but my friends told me that that wasn‚Äôt assault and i shouldn‚Äôt be so dramatic so i just brushed it off. the second time i was filmed without my consent.. he was behind me and filmed and i obviously had no idea until after the fact. and then again i was called dramatic. the third time was with someone i thought i could really trust. i told him my boundaries with condoms and everything. he took it off while in the middle of sex and about 5 minutes after i asked him where it was and he said that it ‚Äúfell off‚Äù but i remember hearing him take it off.. and why wouldn‚Äôt he say anything?? then again i didn‚Äôt think much of it. this all happened within a few months of each other. and i know that‚Äôs not smart of me, i was going through a lot and that doesn‚Äôt excuse my behavior but i just wonder if anyone thinks that maybe i put myself in those positions and maybe somehow it‚Äôs my fault. and maybe none of this was assault and i‚Äôm just overreacting. i don‚Äôt know. i‚Äôm just confused and kind of hurt and i don‚Äôt know how to process.

- don‚Äôt take matters into your own hands justice wise; take the lead from her. If she still wants to see this family and doesn‚Äôt want to disclose the SA to them yet and have a confrontation with that boy, then support her with that. Let her take it at her own pace.¬†

m2smm9r,comment,,"Lesbian here as well who was assaulted by other women! It‚Äôs a weird place to be in but I promise actual sex/kissing etc is lovely and safe and good and isn‚Äôt like what you experienced at all. To clarify, this was assault and if she penetrated you in any way (fingers count) it was rape. Here are all the things that made it unconsensual:¬†

- This woman is 34?? Technically not illegal but sets the tone for it being a predatory encounter¬†

- to start she touched you without getting consent. So that‚Äôs already assault, especially as she kept trying after you pushed her hand away (very obvious verbal cue)

- physical language: you‚Äôre in bed, literally as far away as possible, ASLEEP. Quite clearly not an invitation to initiate sex.¬†

- you never verbally said no, but it doesn‚Äôt sound like you said yes either. Furthermore, you kept pushing her hands away- very obvious no.

- you finally ‚Äògave into her advances‚Äô. This is not consent and you didn‚Äôt give it: you were worn down by her endless attempts.¬†

- stuff like slapping and choking should absolutely be discussed beforehand, you absolutely can‚Äôt do that stuff without consent!!


She assaulted you in a number of ways. She physically touched you and coerced you. I‚Äôm so sorry this happened. That‚Äôs not bad sex, it‚Äôs assault.¬†

For clarity, bad sex might be sex which is a bit awkward or feels a bit ‚Äòoff‚Äô. Or it might be sex where you start off wanting it, but stop halfway through because you‚Äôre not into it (and your partner LISTENS TO YOU and stops), or you consent to kissing but your partner is a terrible kisser.

1hhp9xq,post,Something that happened when i was a kid,"Hey so basically i was thinking about it this morning. This happened when i was around 2,3 or 4 i can‚Äôt remember very well but yeah i didnt tell no one cause I thought they would blame me for it 

So basically when i was around that age my mom had this boyfriend. (Hes not in the picture now and hasn‚Äôt been for all my life after 5years old so for 10 years.) anyways so what happened was we(me and my mom) where at his house we used to go there allot as it was real close to ours but anyway this one time (he could have done this many times but I probably don‚Äôt remember) my mom went out to the shops and i was left alone with him. Nothing really happened for a good id say 3-5 mins and then after we started talking i asked him some questions about the body cause i was curious then about that stuff and i think he answered i dunno but then after i asked to see his dick. I thought this was normal as im pretty sure i heard my mom say it to him or i heard people say it so i assumed u could ask people that and as a kid i had no filter too. But anyway he let me see but what was weird is he didnt even hesitate or anything like that he straight up pulled it out and then he told me i could touch it so i did but then he guided my movements to give him a HJ. But before he could finsh or whatever my mom came back so he rushed me to the bathroom like he told me to go there to wash my hands my mom did suspect something as his zipper was down but thats all i remember

I messed up and did something just by myself and now I feel disgusted. anything that happens I associate with him and I feel guilty for feeling any pleasure when I only ever had those experiences with him. but I'm mad at him for even introducing me to it all. I'm mad at him for corrupting me. I'm mad at him for making me do things and now making me hate them even more. I feel like it I ever have a desire or do something it means that I wanted everything he did to me because why would I have a desire for any physical pleasure after what he did to me? I'm so upset. I didn't want to do anything and I couldn't help it and I wanted to reclaim myself but now I'm just crying because he ruined everything. I wish he would just stop effecting my thoughts and actions but I can't just forget about it all and move on. it's such a weird and complex trauma and I need help and I'm trying to find a therapist but idk how. now I'm just crying. I'm so upset. I am disgusted by any form of pleasure I can't even enjoy anything without either just thinking of him because of reminders or being disgusted that I'm letting myself keep doing the things he made me do. I'm so upset. it's not fair. he ruined my life. hes given me this trauma that I have to live with forever. it's not fair. ,1,1.0,2024-12-19 09:51:50,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hhpj2n/ranting/

1hhpltv,post,I just found out my parents don't believe I was assaulted,"(I can only add one flair but this is also a rant/needing advice) 

For some backstory, I was repeatedly molested/assaulted by my older brother since I was a child (he's two years older than me) I don't know how old I was when it started as I have blocked out a lot, but I believe I was 10-11. When I was 15, I sat both of my parents down in therapy and told them about the abuse after he had tried to assault me again a week prior. At the time, my parents were furious, and were very much on my side. Cps was involved and I was removed from the home to live with my grandparents. After that, my parents were distant. I stayed at my grandparents for 9 months, I wanted to be back with my parents.

My abuser still lives with us but is off at college, only coming home on the weekends. A few months ago (I'm now 18) I talked to my dad about how I was very uncomfortable with my abuser still living in the same space as me. I feel like an ass but I told him flat out that I was going to move out if my abuser didn't move out. My dad chose to kick my abuser out. He lives in a dorm by himself so I wasn't worried he would be homeless.
After the decision, my dad started getting aggressive with me, he even hit me a few times. After a week of feeling guilty for it all, I went to my dad and we talked. I don't remember what we talked about, but he confessed to me that ever since he talked to my abuser years ago, he didn't believe my story. That things ""didn't add up"" due to my memory gaps and behavior during the times I told him it happened. I shut down after he said that and we have barely talked since.

My abuser is staying with us full time for the holidays, it's only been 2 days and it's been torture. I feel so trapped as I don't have a job or a license. I have a cousin across the country that has offered me a place to stay, only I'm hesitant with my no job experience and no license, along with owning a cat and 3 birds. I'm scared to uproot my whole life and I'm not sure what to do. My boyfriend thinks I should go and I think he's right, I'm just scared of the change of everything. 

Sorry its long, I have a lot on my plate. Any advice or kind words are greatly appreciated and thank you all in advance.",7,7.0,2024-12-19 09:57:37,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hhpltv/i_just_found_out_my_parents_dont_believe_i_was/

1hhqmq1,post,Is it sexual assault ,"(21f ) My first time losing my virginity was at 18. I remember that I felt ready yet nervous. The guy I had agree to do an FWB with was nice. When we started to get busy, he shoved his dick in, and at the time I was a much worse people pleaser and new to everything. I vaguely remember asking if he wore a condom during it, and he said no, and since we were already in the middle of the act, I just brushed it off and said it was okay. Later down the line, I‚Äôve had new worst hook-ups, and each hook-up continuously got worse and worse with each new person. Most would not use a condom and not even ask me. Even when they promised to use one, they would forget, or they would be too in the moment and say it‚Äôs fine. I always just brushed it off, but either way, I always felt gross after. I didn‚Äôt have much self-respect for myself, and I also didn‚Äôt want to disappoint them because I know it feels better for them without one on. For me, however, I have never been able to finish from a guy. I have never felt any pleasure really. I feel things, but I would always dissociate during the act. I know it‚Äôs my fault for getting myself in these situations, so that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs considered sexual assault; however, it does make me depressed and really upset knowing how many guys I‚Äôve caved in to just because I felt pure pressure even when there might‚Äôve been no pure pressure at all. I‚Äôm not sure. ",1,2.0,2024-12-19 11:10:12,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hhqmq1/is_it_sexual_assault/

It was in November of last year when my family and I were visiting this small town a few hours from where we live. I'm pretty familiar with the place as we've visited there almost every year since I was very little. Anyway, we were looking around one of the many gift shops. We eventually went to check out and as we were waiting in line, I felt someone grab my lower back and  start rubbing me. It startled me and I turned around to see who was touching me. This younger guy was standing literally like an inch behind me. His expression changed to that of shock when he saw my face and he immediately muttered an apology. I was extremely confused. It shook me up for the rest of the day and I didn't tell my parents about it. I thought it was super weird, but I didn't think much else of it.

1hhr86b,post,Was I [16M] sexually assulted?,"Was  I sexually assaulted?
Sorry in advance if it's triggering to some.

I [16M] had an ex [16M] who has a very high libido while I have a low one.

Okay so some background is that the ex and I were long distance (1 hour drive). I would see him every weekend via public transport. He was my first and I was his. We started dating in January and it ended in August. At the beginning of the relationship I was really quick to get into the sexual part or things and enjoyed the journey of bottoming and it in general. We would have either sex or do other sexual activities every time I was at his (every weekend, so from Friday afternoon to Sunday afternoon). In the beginning we would do it when I was comfortable with it and all that, (he was always willing and ready). He was constantly horny and would masturbate a few times a day which I don't really care about it's just you'd think that since he does it so often he wouldn't be so eager to engage in sex.

Throughout the relationship I've only initiated it about handful of times. Don't get me wrong I still was horny bc teen hormones and stuff. But at a point in our relationship (about halfway) I wasn't thst interested in sex or anything because it was kind of the only thing we ever did. We never went out, walks, games etc. He'd have me over and we'd watch TV and I wouldn't exactly be allowed to sit by myself, I had to be cuddling him or vice versa. If we weren't cuddling he'd get upset bc ""Something had to be wrong"" (as in I had to be mad or upset). He was very clingy and always wanted to be attached at the hip basically. It was suffocating.

Sorry anyways, the relationship was basically all sex. And the thing is when he initiated I would agree sometimes but if I didn't agree he'd continue asking even if I say no multiple times and would inly stop asking if I had attitude with him and then he would get sad and upset which made me feel bad. Other times I would say no and he'd keep asking and the only way to stop him from continuing to ask is if I'd agree. So I did. I didn't particularly like it but he would get upset otherwise and then bring up other stuff he's sad/upset about in his life or our relationship then would cry then he would ask afterwards and I'd agree because I'd pity him. It did feel good so it wasn't a problem at the time. 

A lot I mean A LOT of the time he'd play with my üï≥ and would try put his fingers in but I'd always tell him to stop and he would, but would continue to do it every single time. One time I confronted him about it and he said that he just tries his shot to see if I say yes sometimes. Like what.
Or he'd beg me to suck him off and sometimes I'd be willing to because I do enjoy it but a lot of times I wouldn't want to do it or wouldn't want to continue bc I felt like throwing up or just didn't have it in me but he'd keep asking or he'd say ""if you do it I'll suck yours later"", as if it was something transactional. The thing is I don't particularly actually getting sucked off anyway but he didn't know that, so I can't blame him for that. 

Another thing is that if I said no and he'd leave me alone he'd just jerk off while fondling my butt. Which isn't too big of a deal to me but it felt weird. I never said anything against it though. Or whenever there was a time where I actually was horny and he wasn't he would be disgusted by the idea of it and would get upset and annoyed at me.

Also one major thing is, all this would happen (like him asking and stuff) as soon as we woke up, an hour after we woke up, at noon, multiple times at night and all that. It was constant and I was exhausted, I was really exhausted. But luckily I'm out the relationship and I feel happier and free. 
One last thing is that he was a pretty emotional guy and really sensitive.

So could anyone tell me if what he did was bad or what. I just feel uneasy about it all.

Thank you for hearing me out.",2,8.0,2024-12-19 11:51:00,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hhr86b/was_i_16m_sexually_assulted/

1hhrgfu,post,I was molested by my Aunties Boyfriend ,I am sort of new this app. I recently was told that I avoid my issues (although i don‚Äôt feel this is true i just don‚Äôt know how to deal with it) and I figured should I open to options that i didn‚Äôt feel engaging in before. So i‚Äôll try to open up on here. I‚Äôll start now. I was between the ages of 6-9 I can‚Äôt finally remember what I aged but I know i was under the age of 18. He at first took me wherever I wanted to go. I guess it was planned to go to the library for the day and they had a dunkin‚Äô donuts so I said look they have a dunkin‚Äô donuts so he took us there. At some point we left and we passed by a corner store and i loved to go there because they had the best snacks so he took us there and got me what I wanted then took us back to the house. i‚Äôm trying my best to recall. while we were at the house he told me to come upstairs. in which i did and i enter the room and he standing in the closet i hesitated to go there but he insisted i go in so I did i forgot what he saying to me before hand but all I can remember is him saying to ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt be telling people i being buy you all these snacks‚Äù he says this as he touching/rubbing my butt. he then goes ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt want me touching your butt?‚Äù or something like that in which i respond ‚Äúno‚Äù because my mom said not let boys touch my but. that‚Äôs only reason I said no.,8,2.0,2024-12-19 12:05:45,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hhrgfu/i_was_molested_by_my_aunties_boyfriend/

Yes this is a (not so) lovely example of sexual coercion. Making you feel like you have no choice on whether you participate or not. Of course you also said that he would try to play with your A*hole, that in itself especially; if he didn‚Äôt ask, is also sexual assault.

I will also add that because of the nature of the coercion leading to sex this was rape.

1hhryna,post,loss of libido due to sa causing issues with intimacy ,"for some context im 22f and my boyfriend is 23m. i have a pretty long history of sexual trauma from my ex, and two other guys

my libido is all over the place. sometimes im extremely hypersexual and other times i cant imagine having sex without wanting to throw up and cry. i recently learned that this is a symptom of sexual trauma and not a lack of attraction to my boyfriend 

me and him have been having some recent issues with intimacy. my boyfriend has been pre mature ejaculating which was never ever problem until about two months ago. he did some research and is trying to change it

we found out that having sex more often can help the pre mature ejaculation

i recently told him about the issues with my libido (over text) and he told me that its ok and he understands 

but a few days ago we had another conversation
about it (in person). he told me he would never ever force or pressure me into sex and i 100% believe him. but he did bring up that having sex more can help with the issue we are having 

he brought up that it can be hard for him when we hang out for a while and not have sex because he is very attracted to me and enjoys being with me like that. and i usually enjoy it too but sometimes i just cant do it 

i guess my point is that its hard that the actions of some really shitting guys from years ago is still negatively impacting my relationship 

me and my boyfriend have been together for over four years and it is the best and healthiest relationship ive ever been in. hes always there for me when im struggling with my mental health and i love him so much

im not sure how to move forward from this, and i know i should probably talk to him about how ive been feeling i just dont know how to bring it up without causing more issues ",2,1.0,2024-12-19 12:36:35,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hhryna/loss_of_libido_due_to_sa_causing_issues_with/

m2tbmms,comment,,"Ok I‚Äôm gonna tell you a little story here.

When I was your age I was in a relationship with this guy, he was sweet and I felt like he was kind. At some point he too was pressuring me into doing sexual acts, I said no. He pressured me until I agreed. Then he broke up with me because he got bored. It was over the next couple months that he let his true self show. 

So my experience was very similar to yours.

Sexual coercion has 2 technical definitions.
1. Being forced or threatened into sexual acts

2. (The one that you fall under) being pressured until you feel like you can‚Äôt say no.

As for what you said about not saying no: consent needs to be a verbal and enthusiastic yes (Only exception is if say you had a CNC agreement). A yes gained through pressure or force doesn‚Äôt count as consent. It‚Äôs very simple.
 There is also the matter of physical consent, being that at any point one party doesn‚Äôt seem to be having a good time then you‚Äôre typically supposed to stop and ask if they still want to continue. Which you said that your ex didn‚Äôt do.

As for what you said about him being really nice to you. I see 2 possibilities here.

1. He was using a mask to manipulate you.
2. He knew what he was doing was wrong yet still chose to do it anyway.

When it comes to how people act in cases like this there is often a lot of people that say things like ‚Äúbut he was so nice‚Äù and it allows to many people to get away with things they shouldn‚Äôt.
Especially when that statement is used to victim blame.
And for others (myself included) it takes a while of examining their actions to realize how bad these people are.",1,,2024-12-19 12:39:26,t1_m2taamu,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hhr86b/was_i_16m_sexually_assulted/m2tbmms/

Just know that how people treat you is often in line with their motives. If they want something bad enough then they will do anything to get it.

As I said earlier i experienced sexual coercion, and so did my BF. It might take time for you to realize that you‚Äôre worth more than how you were treated and I wish you the best of luck with this.

m2tddws,comment,,"Thank you, I think it'll take a while for me to actually fully realise that what you're saying is the truth. Like I don't want to believe it but I know it's true I just haven't fully accepted that fact. I don't think my ex was faking his kindness, I just think he really lacked to understand how I feel and look (as in comfortability). But then again I do know that he knew that some of the times what he did was wrong because he'd feel bad about asking but only when I got mad at him. I don't think he meant to harm so that's why I'm still not completely set on him being a sexual assaulter. 

Can someone sexually assault without the intent to?

It took me up until my current BF treating me the right way for me to understand just how fucked up what happened to me was.

1hhts8k,post,Was I raped?,"
A few months back an I was seeing a guy, he was really patient and and understanding and I liked how I could trust him I liked receiving affection from him but later on he would want more and more and would start touching me as if implying he wanted more. I was shy this was my first time being being in a romantic relationship with a cis man he knew that I was just nervous because it was newer to me. I said I was not ready and he would back off but still do things like rub my genitals and kiss me. He always talked about sex and what turned him on or was outwardly loud about things that he found attractive. I feel like throughout the time together I  felt like a lot of pressure to make him happy.

 just one day we were sitting together I had my hand on his lap and he was rubbing my shoulder and grabbed my hand it moved it on to where his bulge was. I was caught so off guard at this moment i didn‚Äôt move my hand at all he started moving his hand down from my should to waist. I just so nervous he started moving my hand so I just went along and did it myself and he started kissing me and eventually his penis was out. He asked me if he like it and I said I did because I found him attractive. He moved my head down and I still felt really tense so I just laid on his lap and just used my hands until he started pushing it towards my mouth so I decided to just let it in just a few moments later I said I just needed a break but he said I was almost there and took my hand and just started masturbating with it and just took my head and used me I tried pushing away tapping his thighs struggling to talk and I said I needed a break and he just okay and when I stood up he grabbed my hand told me to stay and hold still and he stood up obviously at this point to finish and eventually it got on me. I wasn‚Äôt feeling upset at the time I felt nothing? I felt happy that he found me attractive and he felt good but also i just felt uncomfortable after that. We saw each other less and less withdrew my attention I talked to him less and eventually told him that I just wasn‚Äôt interested anymore and didn‚Äôt explain when he asked for a reason and he just was so content with everything he said he understands and just like that it was done.
I don‚Äôt feel sad or super emotional just uncomfortable and disappointed it lingers inside of me so it feels like it wasn‚Äôt much of a big deal ",1,2.0,2024-12-19 14:14:03,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hhts8k/was_i_raped/

1hhutoa,post,my letter to the parents of the boy who SA me,"i didnt want to put in a court order against him so i wrote this letter to this parents, please anyone give me advice on how to make it hit harder ect. 

Dear Mr and Mrs BLANK,

This is a letter you might want to sit down for and read together. I am unsure what the state of your marriage is, but I think it is important that the two of you work through this together with your son BLANK. Please read until the end of this note to come to any conclusions through it might be difficult, I am a YOUNG-year-old girl and would not like to go into further detail about my identity.¬†

On the 20th of October your son snuck into my house with my permission after meeting on a kids dating app called ‚ÄòBLANK‚Äô. I was upset because a guy who I was speaking to cancelled plans with me last minute so I wanted to hang out with someone for comfort and to not be alone. I made my intentions clear that I was not wanting to have sexual intercourse with him as I wasn‚Äôt comfortable with that. I understood there was expectations for kissing which I was accepting of. NAME came to my house in a uber that I paid for. Unfortunately, the night did not go to plan and your son forced himself on me and raped me. Right after he inserted himself I lay there curled on the side of my bed with a tear running down my face and he sat there holding his knees rocking back and fourth. Being a female who comes from a background of lots of arguing my initial reaction to someone feeling sad is to damage control. After I was raped I comforted him and said it was okay and its fine making it not want to become a big deal. I also didn‚Äôt know him well and was unsure what was going to happen to my safety. He was persistent about going outside and smoking a cigarette from a packet he had on him so, we went outside and he did just that. We then went back to my room and I just wanted to sleep it off so he could public transport home in the morning and leave but he was persistent he couldn‚Äôt sleep until he ‚Äòfinished‚Äô as it was uncomfortable for him. Wanting to get it over and done with and feeling his pressure I just gave up and he used my body. The next morning he left. I have never felt so ashamed, humiliated and weak as a women in my life.¬†

I stripped my bedsheets and broke down. I sat there on my comforter staring into the wall for what seemed like forever. Every traumatising moment in my life, every decision I ever had made, If someone was to ask me what the moments before death would be like I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs similar to the moment after I was raped by your son. It‚Äôs a feeling I can‚Äôt explain or even think about contextualising into words unless it‚Äôs happened to you, and I hope it‚Äôs not happened to either one of you. following this I left my room and wouldn‚Äôt come back until the week after. I felt physically sick any time a walked past the door. I slept in the study for the first 3 days. Every time I‚Äôd lay down I‚Äôd feel it all happening again so I slept upright in a chair for 3 days. Running for hours each day and late into the night so that I was so physically exhausted that I could be granted the comfort of sleep to escape the visions and feeling of your son taking advantage of me. I later moved into my siblings beds and finally a week later I went back into my room and tore down all my posters and memorabilia, all my personality that had been built up hanging on the walls gone in a hour. I didn‚Äôt go to school that whole week, unusual for a student like me. I had to push this all aside because my dad had an injury and I had to take care of him so I didn‚Äôt have time to mourn the loss of myself. Only now at the conclusion of school have I been able to sit down and properly decipher what had happened. I can‚Äôt begin to work through it honestly. I‚Äôve tried with my therapist but I break down every time I think about it. This is not typical for me as I‚Äôve delt through childhood abuse, a bad divorce Aswell as having a bipolar mother. I‚Äôve always thought I was strong. Your son stripped me of my strength with every trust he invaded my body with. I‚Äôve tried all my past hobbies, art, reading, cooking. Absolutely nothing brings me the same joy it did before. I struggle to even be around men and the smell of Tabacco sends me into high alert and gives me anxiety for hours. I‚Äôve turned into a shell of the women I used to be. Its been 2 months to the day that I‚Äôm writing this. Every month on the 19th I cant sleep on my bed. its not even that I‚Äôm aware of it, my body will not let me sleep, an anniversary of the day I lost myself. I am trying my best to function as a person in society but I feel so alone and detached from myself and emotions.¬†

I live alone with my dad and he was recovering from a brain bleed and has a history of heart attacks so I did not want to burden him with finding out his little girl was raped. I spoke to my therapist about this because I was unable to deal with it myself and she helped and my school then got involved. I now have had child protective services reach out to me. I am sure you are wondering how to defend your son in this and what the legal repercussions of rape are. Because I am NOT A MINOR he cannot be charged for raping a minor although because he is between 16-17 years of age he can go to prison for up to 10 years as this was sexual penetration. If you would like to educate yourselves on this there is recourses online or you can contact child protective services phone number: 13 21 11. I have full ability to take you to court as I come from an affluent family where lawyers will not be an issue. Although because of the nature of this situation I could not bear slandering my families name and forcing my family to confront this situation or even fathom sitting across your son at a table in court knowing what he took from me. I also don‚Äôt believe in ruining someone life over a moment, this is the mercy I‚Äôm showing your son that he didn‚Äôt show me. I have only now told my dad due to fear of CPS contacting him before I did and no one else but professionals and the police know. I feel extremely ashamed and want as little people to know about this as possible because your son has stripped my power and made me feel weak to my bones. I do however expect you to teach your son the importance of consent and to translate the pain I feel in this message to him as your duty as a parent and as a human being. I would like to move forward in my life in whatever way I can after this horrific event and I hope you have the decency to allow me to do that and not search for my identity, please if you can offer me anything after this event it would be that peace.¬†

I struggle with confidence now but I am confident that I did not deserve what happened to me and I‚Äôd hope you do not wish rape on any other girl or women in this world. Please do what you can to fix your sons mindset on consent and sex for the next happy little YOUNG-year-old girl who might fall victim to this. ¬†",5,6.0,2024-12-19 15:04:02,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hhutoa/my_letter_to_the_parents_of_the_boy_who_sa_me/

1hhvgie,post,My step-brother came into my bed,"I still cannot wrap my head around it, even 4 years after it happened.

(I was 19F and my brother 18M at the time)

My brother and I always had a rocky relationship but one Christmas Eve the family got drunk and step-bro and I got to talking. I don't remember about what since I was drunk.

Long story short I went back to my room to sleep (I somehow drunkenly maneged to undress for bed) and I woke up with him ontop of me, naked. He was kissing me and moving against me.

I was disoriented and scared so I kicked him off and ran down to wake up my parents. 

I don't quite remember more.

I've told our parents, but my mom confronted me after that night and said she always knew I had it in me to do these kind of thing.

""Boys will be boys"" she said the all known saying.

The story never got anywhere, I was told never to speak of this again, and that I was the one who riled him up.

My brother said I innitiated it and it was all my fault and our parents went with it.

My mom responded to these events by drinking 3 days straight to a blackout making me take care of her, she was yelling about how her partner's son raped me, while her partner kept yelling back I was a whore.

Regardless they are still married, very much love each other and my brother.

I moved out of the country a few years later.

And I still don't know if I was even raped.",2,3.0,2024-12-19 15:32:47,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hhvgie/my_stepbrother_came_into_my_bed/

1hhwldw,post,"Sexually assaulted by my cousin, I don't know what to do","Damn, this happened to me recently, and I don't know what to do, and I really need to express myself. For context, I (17M), was on vacation without my parents at my aunt and uncle's, who have two children, including a 12-year-old daughter. We'd always had what I'd call a normal relationship between cousins who are 5 years apart, and from memory, nothing ""weird"" had ever happened. However, that was until last night. The evening had gone as normal (dinner, some chatting, a bit of TV), and everyone had gone to sleep as normal. I sleep a bit apart (in the guest room) so am just asleep a bit later because I allowed myself to watch a movie on my phone. 
However, I wake up to strange sensations, it takes me a few seconds to understand what's going on: my cousin had my sex in her mouth. I jumped like never before, almost screaming, and she fled very quickly, giving me time to do nothing.

Obviously, I couldn't sleep all night, I was far too panicked (and still am). I'm in far too much pain to talk to her about it, and I don't think she's very well either. I'm afraid to tell anyone in my family, for fear she'll blame me, out of panic or some other reason, and make me look like a monster. F*** it too, I've been assaulted by a child, I feel terrible, guilty and I don't know what to do. I just wanted to talk about it, but if you have any advice on how to deal with this situation, thank you in advance.",7,9.0,2024-12-19 16:23:25,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hhwldw/sexually_assaulted_by_my_cousin_i_dont_know_what/

1hhxbh4,post,Was I SA‚Äôd if i didnt say no?,"All the things I described happened a month ago but it‚Äôs been on my mind ever since. I really want to know if what I experienced was SA or not, since I never explicitly said no in any instance. Sorry in advance if this is triggering.

I agreed to go on a date with a guy at his place. While we were there, we cuddled on his couch. I turned around and he suddenly started kissing me, pulled down my shirt (I was wearing a strapless bra, so my breasts were completely exposed), and put his hand down my pants. He did not ask for my consent before doing this. I didn‚Äôt feel ready to even kiss him yet, but it happened so quickly that I didn‚Äôt know what to do, so I just let him continue. He stopped after a while. 

Eventually, we met up again. At this point, he had repeatedly told me how much he wanted to have sex with me. I initially told him I wasn‚Äôt ready, but since he had spent so much time/money on me, and he had made it clear from the start how much he wanted to sleep with me, I felt like I ‚Äúowed‚Äù him sex (which i know is fucked up). Even though I didn‚Äôt want to, I agreed to have sex with him since I felt like I had to. We started having sex and he was very rough with me. I was in a lot of pain during the penetration, and I verbally expressed this multiple times (like ‚Äúow‚Äù, ‚Äúouch‚Äù, ‚Äúthat hurts‚Äù, etc).  However, he continued to penetrate me. Eventually, I had to give the excuse that I needed to go to the bathroom to make him stop.

Afterwards, I felt really gross and objectified. During the act, I felt more like an object than a person. It didn‚Äôt help that he was talking dirty to me while he did it, which made me feel even more objectified. I didn‚Äôt see him for a while afterwards, though eventually he asked to meet up again. I remember feeling extremely anxious about meeting him because I was scared he would want to have sex again. When I finally saw him, I remember shutting down completely, I couldn‚Äôt talk to him at all and I felt extremely frightened/disgusted being near him. I was breathing irregularly and was having heart palpitations. I eventually asked him to leave, then I later ended things with him since I knew I would never feel comfortable being with him.

In addition to all this, he would sometimes do what I explicitly told him I was uncomfortable with. For example, I told him that I don‚Äôt like kissing in public. However, he attempted to kiss me twice in public. He would also make sexual jokes about me to our friends (we share a friend group) while I was right there, which I also wasn‚Äôt comfortable with.

Honestly, I can‚Äôt help but feel like it‚Äôs my fault. I never actually said no, which makes me feel partially responsible as well. I believe I could have communicated better.

Anyways, I just needed to get this off my chest and I want to know if what I experienced really was SA or if I just didn‚Äôt make my feelings clear.

TL;DR: Guy did several things to me which I was uncomfortable with. He kissed me, took off my clothes, and touched me without asking. He had rough sex with me and didn‚Äôt stop when i expressed pain. He also said/did things in public which were quite uncomfortable to me. Not sure if I was SA‚Äôd or not since i technically didn‚Äôt say no.",3,5.0,2024-12-19 16:55:09,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hhxbh4/was_i_sad_if_i_didnt_say_no/

1hhxhck,post,Church member tried to groom me - how do I expose him / should I expose him? ,"A church clergy member tried to groom me & two years later I can't move on.
I say ""tried"" because I got away in time before any physical assault could happen. (I know this is a group of sexual assault but I am unsure of where else to turn to). I want revenge and my plan is to print ""PSA"" style notice letters and deliver them around his neighborhood as well as the church he still attends.
He did not face any consequences, & the church kept it hidden. I tried to take legal action but because I didn't get assaulted, no one wanted to take my case. I have plenty of proof including screenshots and voice audio.
I don't know what to do... should I go forward with my plan and warn his community of the horrible person he is? I wanted to make a post on social media about it but I don't know if it'll get the traction I would want to fully expose him.
The trauma I have from this experience lives with me everyday, In my head doing this (printing the letters & exposing him) will help me close the chapter and move on but I don't know anymore.

1hhzk0l,post,I think I was raped last night,"I think I was raped last night. I matched with a local shop worker I see pretty often, on tinder. I had a bit of a crush on him for the past few months so I was chuffed he swiped right on my profile. He invited me over & we had discussed having sex over text so I went with the intention of having sex. We bought some vodka & smoked some weed. We were chatting for a while and then all of a sudden I greened out- a lot of that time is a bit of a blur. I do remember getting sick into the toilet though because I was so fucked up. I don't really remember how we started having sex but I do remember saying ""no wait, stop"" a few times. Bare in mind, I'm so drunk/high I can barely move. So, he's flipping me into different positions. I struggle with male validation so I kept giving in after I was trying to tell him to stop. I said ""ok fine"" after every excuse he told me e.g. ""I promise you'll enjoy it"". So I'm struggling to recognise if it's rape or not because technically, I agreed even if it was coerced. At one point I just closed my eyes, partly because I wanted to see if he'd stop if he thought I was unconscious but also because I just wanted it to be over. Once he was done, I 'jokingly' said ""I was too drunk for that"" and he said he was so drunk too and made the a comment ""well at least we both enjoyed it, right?"". He wanted me to stay over for a second round and we'd order pizza. Of course I wanted to leave straight away so I made an excuse up. 

I haven't told anyone in my life because I told everyone I'm sober so I don't want people to judge that I slipped up last night. I also will not be going to the police.  ",24,8.0,2024-12-19 18:30:12,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hhzk0l/i_think_i_was_raped_last_night/

I told my psychologist and she encouraged me to report, but I just didn‚Äôt have the bandwidth. We were completely alone and I couldn‚Äôt handle being called a liar if I reported it. I didn‚Äôt tell anyone at the time except my ex and I buried it.

Now there are multiple other women who he has done this to. I came forward and there‚Äôs over a dozen and counting. His press release is on social media, and I cannot help myself from being obsessive looking through the comments and shares. Some of the comments are so gut wrenching that it physically hurts me to read them or think about anyone else that he‚Äôs done this to reading them. His oldest victim has a senior ffs. We aren‚Äôt even safe from this when we‚Äôre elderly.

My biggest question is how do I take care of myself while all of this is on social media and plastered on all of our local and national news? Should I just deactivate my accounts and block key words on google? Is it normal to feel obsessive over this?

m2v0jhe,comment,,"First instance: yes it was sexual assault. He didn't ask for consent, and also he was so aggressive and violent - this wasn't just a little peck on the cheek/lips, this was a full on kiss where he also pulled down your top. 

Second instance: this is rape.  He put a lot of pressure on you and coerced you, keeping on saying how much he wanted to have sex with you despite you repeatedly expressing your reluctance to do this. He then kept penetrating you after you expressed that you were in pain. This is a sign to STOP and ask, 'would you like to continue?'. This is not a sign to keep going. 

I actually think you communicated very well. In the first example, the only reason you 'didn't say no' was because he literally didn't give you the chance to. That's like me saying 'oh but I didn't say no' if someone lept out of the bushes and stole my phone. Maybe a bad analogy (you aren't a phone, you're a whole person), but I'm trying to use it to describe how unfair it would be for someone to say 'you didn't say no though' when something was literally taken from me by surprise with no forewarning. The other times, you very much communicated, multiple times. Not only did you communicate through body language cues (showing you were in pain, freezing up etc), you also communicated through verbal language. 'I don't feel ready for this', 'I'm in pain', 'maybe later' are all known as 'soft no's', and they are just as valid as a 'hard no'. They're very fucking obvious signs for your partner to stop and check in. He deliberately bypassed that and in doing so assaulted you.

What's more, I'm really scared to tell my aunt/uncle. First of all, obviously I'm afraid that if I tell, she'll panic and accuse me. In that case, things could get complicated. But above all, it makes me really fucking nervous to tell them.

I loved and cherished that bear and would hold it when I cried and bring it with me if I went on trips. but with his bear of me, he was always using it to make sexual jokes. never did I see him hold it and cherish it, he just pretended to hump it or do stuff like that. it just kinda showed another layer of him only seeing me as a sexual object. when he couldn't get to me the object that was supposed to represent me in a wholesome way was used for him to pretend to use me.

One of them I trusted because I've been friends with him since I was like 15 and I never expected he would put me through this but I guess I was wrong just like with most men. I was invited over to his apartment after he visited me for his birthday. Like I said I trusted him so I went but maybe I'm just an idiot. Right when I got there, there were 2 guys I didn't recognize and they made gross comments towards me which immediately made me want to leave but than they just kind of forced me on the couch to drink alcohol then they made more gross comments I don't want to mention and took me to the bedroom where my friend raped me first while one of the other guys held me down I kind of struggled at first but after the first rape finished I just let it happen and wanted it to be over with. Yes it hurt they did not go softly and my vagina is bruised but I don't want to go into any more details. After they finished they told me to stay there or they'll kill me so bring scared I just stayed there on the bed and I was raped once more later. In the morning they finally said I was free to go but if I told anyone they'd kill me. I just went home and was crying the whole time I tried to keep a straight face and not let anyone know but I just kept crying alone in my room the last few days. I feel ashamed disgusted betrayed, and physically sore and bruised. I still went to work this week but felt miserable the whole time. I just hate this. I hate everything. I hate men. Idk how I'd turn them in Id feel even more disgusted with myself if I told anyone and I don't have the necessary evidence for anything.

1hi2zi1,post,I'm bothered by my loved ones keeping contact with his family.,"I can't really blame her, as my mom has asked me a few times if I want her to cut them off and I say no, but it's bothered me more and more. Almost five years ago, when I was 19, I attended a close knit church with my parents. I needed a place to live, so I lived with the Pastor's adult daughter, her husband (Bobothen, 35), and their kids. I was very close to many of them, including Bobothen's kids and his MiL, Persephone. 

Anyways, Bobothen was drunk one night, pressured me to join him, molested me some over the course of a few hours, etc. I was traumatized. No one seems to agree with me on this, but in hindsight I think it was a failed rape attempt too, since I got closer to his wife's bedroom when I started vomiting and I had my brother on the phone. That has messed me up, but I'm only typing it because this is an anonymous forum. I have little proof. 

Afterwards, I moved back in with my parents and told them, Bobothen's wife, and his in laws. Bobothen calmed them down, and the conversation turned to how we could help Bobothen with his depression, with his drinking, with his issues, and I felt abandoned. After a few days I considered reporting him to the police, so my mom warned Persephone and Bobothen's wife as she tried to talk me down. They agreed to meet with me as they tried to convince me that nothing happened and I could let it go. I wasn't confident in myself, so I accepted it. 

Persephone was especially bad then. She told unprompted that I shouldn't like women (because she is homophobic), that the whole thing would be used by God to better Bobothen's life, that we would all move on, etc. She kept focusing on how he spoke to her and her husband, how he apologized to *them.* I considered her closer to me than my grandparents, and I felt like she barely cared after I was traumatized. I went very low contact after that. 

My mom is still best friends with her, and I realize I don't like it. She was on speakerphone, and just her voice got me in a weird headspace. Then she started talking about how she was going to drive Bobothen to appointments, and it reminded me how intertwined we all are. My mom has seen Bobothen since the event. Persephone sees him regularly and doesn't think of me. My mom brings the kids she watches to church, and part of me doesn't like that she trusts Persephone enough to do that. She does stay with them though, and Bobothen doesn't go to church anymore.

After everything it feels so minor, but I wish we weren't intertwined. I wish my mom understood why I hate them both so much even when part of me still loves Persephone too. I wish they were forever out of my goddamn life",1,1.0,2024-12-19 21:00:54,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hi2zi1/im_bothered_by_my_loved_ones_keeping_contact_with/

1hi6d7d,post,Idk anymore.,"When I was 12, I had a boyfriend who was the same age as me.

He would message me very explicit things, which made me uncomfortable, but I went along with it because I didn't want to lose him.

Keep in mind we were long-distance.

When we met up IRL for the first time, he was very touchy and wanted me to be right next to him.

When we were driving him back home, I was in the back seat with my boyfriend, sitting right next to him. He would take my hand and make me jerk him off.

I still think about that to this day. I don't know if I was abused or if I was the abuser. Maybe both. Like I said, we were both 12.

1hi6tc7,post,"Was/is this sexual abuse or something else? f9-f14 and step-father, drunk mother","He drank a lot. He usually did things when he was drunk. I was either 8 or 9. My mom, also, but she was always extremely drunk. He made me finger myself in front of him. He made me touch/suck his area. I got under him and my mom while they did IT. I've always complied, because I didn't see an issue. I felt shy and weirded out, but I did it because I thought it was normal. One time my mom licked me down there, after I tried and tried to get out, my stepdad held my leg up as she did it. I was in her room. I remember her chasing me so she could do it after my stepdad went to the store to get more beer. I remember begging him to let me go with him. I remember one time he told me to go get my moms dildo, and I did. He made me 'experiment' with one. Or multiple. I can't remember. Now, he slaps my ass and makes comments on my body, calling me 'jugs' or 'booty.' I now completely avoid going out when they are drinking because of these horrible flashbacks and the reminder of what happened and I'm alerted when he's walking down the hall (the bathroom is right next to my room), so I run to my door and lock it/shut off my light if it's not. And sometimes if I'm on call, I become quiet and turn my phone down and tell them to be quiet. I now realize a lot of what I do is shaped by what happened, and what still does. I avoid him whenever I can. He isn't a good guy, due to facts that would basically be more trauma. When I told my friend about a certain memory on call (just one), I kept pausing to sob my eyes out. It's such a touchy subject. I'm wondering if I developed more mental issues, like maybe C-ptsd, and didn't notice it? For the fact that I was abused my whole life on different spectrums. Neglect, emotional abuse, physical abuse, and, I'm assuming sexual too. I am just..only 14. And it is quite disturbing. And confusing. I keep telling myself that I'm not special enough to have ptsd/C-ptsd or bpd, but I match with every singular symptom with both. I feel like I don't have it because all my life, my experiences were dumbed down by both my step-father and mother. So...I can't tell what I experienced or not.

1hi9myr,post,I was assaulted 2-3 years ago,"For context, I think I was 14 years old. For years, my mom has had a friend that we'll call D, for short. They don't talk much anymore, but in 2007 he was put in prison for getting a 14 year old pregnant. I was still allowed around him despite what he did and neither of my parents know what happened.

Not long after we moved to our apartment, I was home alone and D was coming to drop me off food. He did, but stayed longer than my mom knew. We sat in the living room on the floor, I thnk we were playing something for a bit. He started to reach for my thigh often and offered me money if I didn't move his hand. I wasn't thinking, and went along with everything he did. I was freezing up.

We ended up in my bedroom. I was on my bed and he was on the floor. I remember putting a blanket over my lower half because I felt uncomfortable. He got on his phone and pulled up porn. He showed it to me and told me ""this is us."" I pushed him away from me and he chuckled and said it was a joke and that he was kidding.

I eventually got him out of the apartment and I immediately locked the door. I got in the bathtub in an attempt to calm down but I was shaking so bad and I couldn't stop worrying about him managing to get back inside. The entire time he was here I was terrified that I'd get raped. Since then, he's been banned from the apartment complex but I have seen him two or three times since. The only people that know the details are my ex, a friend of mine, and my current boyfriend. I'm still terrifed that I'll get raped one day, but sometimes I feel like I want it to happen (which I know is common).
I've felt miserable and I may be getting a rape kink. I feel like I want used, but when I'm in that situation, I can't do it. I also feel like my situation is invalid because others have went through much worse. I've only heard support, but some days I still try to find creeps online that want to do things to me.

The 6 people that have been harassing me all year for ‚Äúlying about what happened‚Äù were calling me a slut and a tramp and worse saying they hope i try kill myself again and told my boyfriend ‚Äútell your girlfriend that we hope she cuts deeper next time‚Äù along with them making fun of him for his mother who passed away when he was young, and im scared to go to college because these people go to the same as me, im scared to sleep because whenever i lay down i can feel him and i can hear him like hes really there and i hate it, i want it to be over, and i dont know how to deal with it. My parents are saying its my fault im letting it affects me and that i cant blame everything on him, because i failed all my exams because i was taken out of half my lessons because he was in them and i kept having panic attacks ( they made fun of me telling me i was faking it), my ex/assulter also said ‚Äúif it wasnt for what i did when she tried to kill herself she would be dead‚Äù

1hicrv9,post,Finally went to the Police ,"About 7 months ago I was SA'ed (¬øraped?) by the guy(now 17 then 16) I (now 18 then 17) was dating at the time. Immediately after it happened I felt angry and dirty and wanted to go to the police but I didn't know how I would explain to my mom calling from a police station and wasn't sure even where to go so instead I went home and just tried to wash off the feeling and ignore it. Now 7 months later I finally decided to tell adults about what happened. Originally I was just going to tell a trusted teacher but it quickly became larger than that. After spending a few hours at the police station and retelling the explicit story a few times today I just keep wishing I had gone to the police right after and hate myself for not doing so. It was also a case of fight, flight, or freeze AND I ENDED UP FREEZING which after talking to the police has made me start to feel like I should've just said ""no"" like I wanted to, but also I know that I couldn't get those words to leave my mouth, and that it was instinct not me. I'm slightly relieved to have finally told adults since 7 months on emotional turmoil hasn't been fantastic but I know giving this report was only the beginning of the process, and my ex is rather unstable and I'm somewhat afraid of what's to come.

1hiedqs,post,I'm confused ,"I'm not the best at writing sorry if it's written poorly, I ran it through a grammer checker just in case though 
I recently left a yearlong relationship (M15), and I'm trying to figure things out, and something I keep thinking about is what counts as sexual assault because I'm not sure if my partner did it to me or not. We were each other's first everything, including sex, which was mostly initiated by her (F15). The issue is she had some issues understanding no.When I said it, like she would ask about sex, I would say no, and then she would say please, and I'd say no again, and that would continue until I said maybe or later, and eventually she asked again, so I'd just give up and say yes so she'd be quiet, and I spoke to her twice about this behavior and about touching me in certain places in public. I don't remember the first time I brought up her issues with her, but I remember some of the second time I brought it up with her. My ex has autism; this is important to the explanation. Anyways, her defense the second time I brought it up was that she had issues understanding tones of voice because of her autism, which is why she kept asking after I would say no. She wanted me to say it sternly, but I didn't because I was worried she'd get annoyed at me using a tone like that. I probably thought that because of all the arguments we had. I'm not sure if I remember properly or not; my memory isn't always perfect, but she might have said she forgot what no means sometimes. I really just need clearance on this issue because I am confused and don't know how to feel about it.",1,2.0,2024-12-20 07:09:24,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hiedqs/im_confused/

1hif1ew,post,Does it count as SA even if I didn't say no or fight back?,"Reddit doesn't let me use 2 tags but this story is involving a minor and has explicit details, please don't read if this is triggering. I just feel like I'm going insane 

This happened a year ago, I was 14 at the time and I had gone out with a guy that had asked for my number the day before. He met me (accompanied by his friends) outside my school and we walked to a nearby mall, when taking he asked for my age and was surprised when I said 14, he then told me he was 17 and said he had been 'investigating' me and that he wasn't from my school, which struck me as weird but I tried to not think much about it.

When we arrived to the mall we kept talking sitting on a bench when he grabbed my face started kissing me, it was out of nowhere but I didn't say anything, then the conversation kept going for a bit until he told me to go to the parking lot and grabbed my wrist, I followed him without thinking much about it, he suddenly stopped on a set of concrete stairs that was isolated from the rest of the mall and started kissing me again, but then he started groping my ass and kissing my neck and I started getting really uncomfortable and scared, so I told him to wait and he just kept going. Then he grabbed me by the waist and just started moving me however he wanted, he started pressing me against his crotch and then he put me against the wall and started touching me under my clothes. I told him to wait and that we shouldn't do this here but he just kept going as if I hadn't said anything. then he put his fingers inside of me and it just kept going for a while. I felt disconnected from my body and I just stood there without doing anything to stop him. Then he started reaching for my chest, but I pressed my arms really hard towards my torso so he wouldn't be able to touch me there, then he grabbed my wrists again and pushed me towards the stairs telling me to sit down. I did. He sat too and started undoing his pants and pushing my head towards his dick. I told him to wait and that I hadn't ever done that before and was putting resistance but he just told me to open my mouth. And I just did. It kept going on for a while until he decided to stop and we kept walking. He was still grabbing my wrist and I just followed him. I felt like I wasn't in charge of my body. When we reached another isolated area he told me to kneel, but he also let go of my wrist and I said no and started walking away from him. He followed me and started saying that it was the perfect spot and that he had to finish. Then he cornered me and started asking me if I was going to abandon him like everyone. I was petrified and didn't say anything. He started asking me to promise I would never abandon him and kept going until a cop came, then he just grabbed my hand and started walking and talking like nothing happened. He walked me to back to my school and I just cried for hours. I blocked him immediately.

The next day he reached out to my friends and asked them if I 'was okay' and said that he was very worried about me. they blocked him too. One of his friends reached out to me and said the same thing. I blocked him too 

The next week I was leaving school and I saw him standing on the other side of the street waving at me. I just started running and ran until I reached my house. I became super paranoid and started stalking his social media, and learned that he was actually 20, not 17. 

I feel like I'm doing insane. I've had constant panic attacks and been having dreams where I get raped and assaulted and I just feel disgusted with my body. I don't know if I'm overreacting. I just want everything to stop. I need to know if it was actually something bad that happened to me or if it's just in my head.

Second, sounds from the way you tell the story that you did tell him, repeatedly, that you were not ready for these kinds of activities. And at the very least, you made it abundantly clear that he did not have your enthusiastic consent. 

He sounds like a predator honestly, and I think you should consider reporting him.

1hih93e,post,Was this SA?,"I was dating this girl a year ago and it recently came out that she sexually assaulted a couple people (among many other horrible things) and now I'm sort of questioning things. 

When we were together she was super pushy with physical affection, which I wasn't the biggest fan of bc I hate pda but I tolerated it bc I figured that's just how she is and since she was a year older than me I figured that was to be expected bc hormones and stuff. This meant I'd often just let her do things like put her hand between my thighs or put her hand up my shirt (I think there were other things but it's hard to remember a lot of what happened while I was with her tbh).

I also suck at saying no so I'd sort of just try to physically remove her from my body when it went too far. I don't know if the things she did to me count as sa bc it never went further than her touching me or her putting my hands on her while we made out. (For dome reason I still feel gross and kinda hate myself when I think about things I did with her even if it was just kissing.)

My main worry is that I'm only thinking it was bad bc of what's recently been said about her and all my concerns are only bc of hindsight. Overall I just feel pretty confused about everything and since im only 16 I don't have a lot of examples of good relationships to base things on.

Any help with how to tell if it was sa?",1,2.0,2024-12-20 10:48:10,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hih93e/was_this_sa/

1hihebw,post,Did my mother SA me?,"My [23F] Mother [52F] was always narcissistic and abusive, and back in May of this year I moved out for the first time, moved in with my boyfriend, started a whole new life. It‚Äôs lead me to remember and realize a lot of things about my life, and one of them being SA. 

I believe I may have been SA‚Äôd twice in 2 different ways, but I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs really what it was because‚Ä¶ idk. I‚Äôm only gonna write about the 1 that‚Äôs bothering me most, cause the other time Is more context to write out. 

When I was 16, me and my mom had gotten into a major argument (as we did on a daily basis), and she told me for the millionth time that I should be happy because I wasn‚Äôt r*ped and thrown out of the house like she was, and that I shouldn‚Äôt ever feel sad or depressed or be angry because if that never happened to me then my life is perfect. 
This is a routine she went through regularly,
But this time she decided that I needed to understand her trauma better. 

So she forced me down, felt up my private areas through my underwear, and this went on for a few minutes. 

Afterwards she said it was only to teach me lesson, and I just sort of accepted that as if this was a normal thing that happened. It was a little unsettling but I figured that‚Äôs how she intended it to be. 

I literally never thought of it again until after I moved out, now I‚Äôm realizing that perhaps I had been molested.

m2z50nb,comment,,"Oh my gosh, I want to reach out and offer you the biggest hug right now! Thank you for reaching out with this question, as I think there are so many people struggling with the same question.

Let me say this clearly and unequivocally: you said no so many times. What happened was absolutely not your fault, and he knew what he was doing was wrong.

When happened was terrifying and your body went into survival mode. That‚Äôs what you did to keep yourself safe, even if it doesn‚Äôt feel like it! You complied, which means that you did what you needed to do to get out of there without getting more hurt than he would have hurt you otherwise. You told him ‚Äúwait‚Äù several times, because your brain was trying to process what was happening. And any resistance like that- ‚Äúmaybe later‚Äù or ‚ÄúI have a partner‚Äù or ‚Äúslow down/wait‚Äù, or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure‚Äù or silence or physically pulling away‚Ä¶ ALL of that is a way of saying no.

Let me put it this way: when I am having sex with someone, I‚Äôm doing it because I want to, not because someone has their hand on me and I feel scared that if I say no, that they‚Äôre going hurt me‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs because I really want to (and have communicated that to my partner) and that they really want to (and that they‚Äôve indicated that to me). No one thinks that what they did was okay. There are so many red flags (many of which you wouldn‚Äôt have been able to identify because they come with time and experience) that tell me that this guy is really bad news and that his behaviour afterwards makes it sound like he has done this before, and maybe have some kind of personality issue.

What he did was horrific. And I want to tell you something else, something that could be relevant: oftentimes, people will become physically aroused (turned on) when this happens. That is in no way, shape, or form an indication of you consenting. That is not a reason for you to think ‚Äúwell, maybe I was kind of into it‚Ä¶‚Äù. No. That is a normal bodily reaction that keeps you from getting more hurt. (Stuff happened to me when I was 11‚Ä¶ and part of the shame and guilt I carried for so long was that I actually kind of reacted to the things that he did to my body, even though I knew I didn‚Äôt want them to happen and they shouldn‚Äôt make me feel that way. That was not my fault. This is not yours).

You did a good thing by you and your friends completely blocking him. But are you getting help? Like, from a therapist you trust? Or have you confided in an adult? I want you to know that what happened isn‚Äôt okay or normal or anything like that. I can tell you until I‚Äôm blue in the face (I‚Äôm in my mid thirties), but you need to hear it from someone you trust.

Please feel free to ask any questions about what you‚Äôre feeling or questioning. You‚Äôre not alone here ‚ô•Ô∏è",1,,2024-12-20 12:59:26,t3_1hif1ew,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hif1ew/does_it_count_as_sa_even_if_i_didnt_say_no_or/m2z50nb/

Now, about a year and a half later, I (19F), found the love of my life living in another city. He knows about my past, actually recommended coming here to people who might understand.

1hiknkx,post,Idk if this is SA and I‚Äôm freaking out,"
So a few weeks ago, it was pretty cold out and I made the really dumb mistake of wearing this thing that's kind of a mix between a skirt and shorts, and it's kind of flowy / long. I ride the special bus because I'm disabled. So we have an assistant, but our normal one is in his homeland for a while. So we have this substitute which I've met before. My TA was about to get off the bus and the bus driver was using the restroom inside the school. Nobody was looking at this point and he got down on one knee in front of me and started touching my legs, which was kind of close to my upper thigh. (kind of funny he was touching at the part where it began to show my legs on the shorts if that makes sense)  And he kept using two fingers one on the right side of my thigh and one on the left side and started squishing my thigh and massaging it , patting it, etc. without my consent.

I was so concerned I didn't move for a while, but I moved his hand an inch away and politely asked ""uhm what are you doing?"" And he responded with the dumbest excuse of the century by saying. ""I'm trying to see how skinny you are."" Which is really dumb, especially because I was wearing. jersey that's kind of tight because I've had it for a while so he didn't need to touch me in such form, considering he was looking at me for half the time he did that he could just look at me for a second and not need to touch me

Even if it was with no ill intent I'm a teen and he's no younger than his mid 40s at minimum . I've had an awful feeling about this guy for a while. And his voice is like he's congested and doesn't want to clear his throat.

I told the counselor about this, but they still haven't fired him. They only made him work on a different bus for two days and I was excited thinking that it would be a permanent replacement and that I could finally heal from that weird experience but no

I almost forgot to mention this, but when I finally was about to get off, he tapped me on the shoulder and said ""You have a nice beach tan!"" And started giggling like a little girl mind you he knows that that's my natural skin color and my bus driver told him to stop and my dad was just awkwardly laughing because he didn't know what to do

And then, when I got down to the first step, he interrupted me and said ""h- hey I know why you wanted to wear shorts today."" And I said ""OK, why is that?"" And he said ""s- so You could show your legs off to the boys and look pretty / cool."" Like I said before I'm disabled and my mom helps me pick out my outfit sometimes. And I don't impress men . And if I do something to fit in, it's to fit in around my friends not around boys just because I wear shorts doesn't mean I seek appeal And that just felt really weird coming from him so I just gave him a nasty look and got off that bus as quick as I could.

Mind you those two paragraphs that you just read were right in front of my dad. And my dad is way stronger than that toothpick but we both didn't know what to do. 

Tension is high now and he won't talk to me thank goodness, but I'm still really scared and I don't know what to do. I think he might've gotten scolded considering he doesn't sound as congested and he sounds more depressed


EDIT: I forgot to mention this, but about a week prior, I was about to walk to the front door of my house and he screamed out loud to me ""I NEED ME A SOUTH AMERICAN WOMAN HIT ME UP IF YOU KNOW ANY."" 

Which I found really odd because he knows that I'm South American, and he knew that I am. Not just that, but I find it really odd that he did that to me out of all people which is no coincidence because he knows that I'm the only fully conscious girl on that bus and he goes up to the front of the bus where I sit frequently. And he knows that I'm pretty quiet when it comes to things like reporting people or just quiet to some people in general so he thought that he could get away with it probably even though there's a security camera right above my seat",5,6.0,2024-12-20 14:13:45,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hiknkx/idk_if_this_is_sa_and_im_freaking_out/

1hilrzt,post,I need help.,"Hello. I'm a guy (20). When I was smaller (9-13 ish) I was being molested by my doctor and didn't even know. My grandma wouldn't be in the room most of the time and thinking back she would always hold and grab my penis well after I was done coughing.One day grandma caught her and I haven't had a physical in almost 7 years. When I was in my freshman year of highschool my teammates held my arms and spread my legs to shove a cone in my ass. My shorts were never taken off but it still really hurt and I might've limped for a minute. I ended up staying on the cross country team because I was so lonely and just wanted some friends. Fast forward about two years and suddenly I feel the urge to explore myself. I liked it. I mean really did it was great. But immediately afterwards it popped into my head again and I felt disgusted with myself and called myself all kinds of horrible things. I started struggling with my sexuality afterwards because I don't know if I like it because of what they did to me or it's something else. All I've gathered for a conclusion is that I deserved it somehow. I've been suicidal, tired, frustrated because I'm scared of meeting and being vulnerable around people anymore. I'm not normal anymore and I want to know how to be normal again. Even the women at my job are triggering me because they're always saying weird things about dating the senioras or trying to tickle me and forcing me to dance I can't feel strong. I've been trying to figure out what I've been doing wrong but I'm tired. I'm weak. I'm worth less than a street dog. I don't want to deal with myself anymore. I think I deserve to die.

He said it was okay and not a problem and si we started having sex. He decided to switch positions and he was behind me. He took the condom off and tried to hide it under the pillow next to me.

1himlre,post,Is this really certified as 'sexual abuse'? (Involving a minor & quite the rant),"So when I was 12, I always wanted to make friends online or even try to date. I only wanted to feel how it was having a boyfriend who would like you, since my friend had one at that time and so on. I still only want to make online friends but I'm more cautious. So I downloaded an app that was normally used to only make friends, but ofcourse some do date. So I met a supposed 14 year old American boy named Josh. We talked for a bit and then we got on snapchat. He instantly send sexual messages, but at the same time he told me how beautiful I was. He send nudes of himself and him having an erection, and he wanted me to send some too, and I did. I 'knew' that what I was doing was wrong even though I thought I was pretty smart at that age, but I ignored the warnings and thought everything would be okay. I was too young to realize how really severe it was. He also told me it was normal. So when the day ends, he always tells me good night or love you. It made me feel cared for. The next days he would tell how he got horny when he thinks of me, and I played along. This continued for a month when he randomly dissapeared and stopped responding. I tried to text him but he didn't respond. I then became a little nervous at the thought of him having my photos on his phone and the possibility of sharing it. Also, I asked him to send another picture of his cheek to make sure he was 14 and he send a very convincing picture of the same boy. 

Just a few days ago after a couple of years, I found a few pictures of him from that whole experience. But when I examined it, I realized that he wasn't 14 and faked his identity and stole the photos from the internet. He had the body of a grown man between 30-45. My personality and sensitivity changed since then but I don't know if it was because of this or not. And I can't get this experience out of my head, I tried to forget it but I can't. This hasn't made me cry yet but I feel ashamed that I did what he told me to.",3,11.0,2024-12-20 15:46:30,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1himlre/is_this_really_certified_as_sexual_abuse/

m2zyqbt,comment,,"Just to let you know, you're not alone. Sadly, many people go through what you experienced. But dont let it get to you, you are more worth than suicide. You're 20 and you still have a whole life ahead of you. Don't make them satisfied, live like the person you are. You are not disgusting, the people who did that to you are disgusting. You feel disgusted because your body was touched without permission, but that doesn't make you any less worth and that doesn't make you look ugly. You are a human being, as much worth as anyone else, so be you.


And if your coworkers are bothering you, don't be afraid to say it. If you cant, I advice you to speak to your boss. But if that also doesn't work, my last tip is too try to find a job at a more 'calmer' place where others won't just tickle you. I can't say much since I'm still too young to work but your opinion and feelings matter.



The thoughts are probably going crazy in your head, so that's why you need distraction. Do you have hobbies? I recommend finding something that will built character. I don't know if you struggle with image or if you're self conscious, but if you are, work out. I'm totally not saying that you are fat or something, but when improving your physical look, your confidence can go up. If you don't want to go to the gym, just work out at your home. Works out fine! I do and I got leaner and more toned. You can also practice baking/cooking. You don't have to stress your body out too much but atleast you will move your body once in a while. And after all that hard work, your food will be your reward at the end.",1,,2024-12-20 16:08:16,t3_1hilrzt,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hilrzt/i_need_help/m2zyqbt/

1hin6jl,post,Was this sexual assault?,"An adult man in his 30s locks a 5/6-year-old child in a room and tells them to give him a head massage. The child complies because of a promise for material things. During the massage the adult man steals a kiss from the child on the lips, knowing the child hates that. He has done so before alongside other forms of manipulation. The child attempts to run out and feels disgusted with their body. The adult man is their father. It's normal for fathers to kiss their children affectionately. Some have said this isn't assault. Add to that that children must have no understanding of consent.

I'm not you so I don't know what happened in detail, but if that man did touch any sexual body part (which is sexual assault) or had sexual intentions then, make sure to report it.


Sexual harassment is ofcourse no different than sexual assault, and it's better to prevent that from happening to you.

1hipydn,post,How to survive the first few days?,"Hi all, 
I (f21) got raped yesterday evening. Afterwards I called the police and had the whole proces done with the rape kit etc. 
I also called two close friends for emotional support. 
The whole proces of the rape kit and stuff took basically the whole night, since it was late at night and people (doctors and special police) had to come from all over. 
Afterwards I didn‚Äôt want to be alone so I slept at my friend‚Äôs place. 
They are really good at comforting me and seeing the small signs when I‚Äôm about to go into panic mode. 

I went through a similar situation about half a year ago. But that time I didn‚Äôt go to the police (it‚Äôs part of the reason I did go this time). I am a medical student and the first time my mind went into a sort of clinical headspace. I showered, the next day called for a STD testing appointment, did research about common symptoms and I kept a list of my symptoms. 
It took me a few months to understand the gravity of the situation. 
But that initial time period, right after, my mind was in a denial, quiet, peaceful mind space. 

This time is very different. Maybe because I went to the police and had the rape kit (and the whole proces)
My mind is in shambles. 
I feel completely empty and so heavy at the same time.
And I can‚Äôt stop shaking. 

I can‚Äôt stay at my friend‚Äôs place. I am trying to find an other friend to stay at. 
I am terrified to go home. 
The guy who did this lives in my street and knows where I live. 
Also I‚Äôm terrified to be alone. The moment I‚Äôm alone I start shaking, hyperventilating, reliving yesterday. And I mean literally the moment. It also happens when I go to the toilet. 

My mind is in shambles. I don‚Äôt know how to survive these first days. 
How do I survive this? 
How do I survive these first few days. 
And even if I can find a place tonight, I‚Äôll have to go back home the day after. 
How do I do that? 
How do I survive being alone?
How do I pretend everything is fine at home (especially with the holidays)?

I‚Äôll appreciate every tip <3

1hiquup,post,Was this SA? Is it possible to have trauma from this?,"I'll be direct with this, so trigger warning for explicit discussion of child sexual assault, and domestic violence. 

When I was young, probably between 5-8, a relative who is 10 years older than me made me touch their chest regions, and touched me around my chest regions and a little lower. This was framed as a game, and I was visibly disturbed and confused even at the time. This relative, I remember, always made sexual remarks towards me when I was a kid, and would often ask me to be naked in their presence and do certain things that didn't involve physical contact, so ik that their intentions were also sexual when this incident happened.

But my question is if this incident can even be considered as sexual abuse or harrasment because they were also only in their teens, and it wasn't anything too severe. 
And if my reactions- which weren't present during my childhood and early teens, but came up recently- ( shaking, crying, feeling sick, verbal shut downs, nightmares ) to media with depictions of CSA in it are rooted in this experience. Or if they are more rooted in general domestic violence which I also experiencing at the same time, or the adult-child romantic/sexual relationships I had during my early teens, which were often emotionally abusive. 

I'm sorry if this is a dumb post to make, but I've been very confused and somewhat in denial about this for a long time. It wasn't until I had a very violent reaction towards this relatives non-sexual touching recently that I realised that there was no point in debating wether it had happened or not, because ik that it has. And now I wanna understand it better, so that I can come to terms with it.

m31bmt8,comment,,"The reason you never 'said no' was because he didn't give you a CHANCE to say no. If we take the tea analogy, he never offered you a cup of tea - he just forced it down your throat. He should have ASKED to kiss you, either verbally (can I kiss you), or at the very least non verbally (slowly moving in, looking into your eyes, seeing if you're moving in too etc). Just grabbing and kissing you never gave you the chance to say no, or time to pull away. 

Also, you did actually 'say no'. Saying 'wait' means 'stop' to literally everyone - it's quite clearly saying, 'lets stop for a bit'. So you did verbally communicate, very clearly, and multiple times. Furthermore, you gave a VERY clear 'no' through body language - you pushed him away, multiple times. That's a very fucking obvious 'no'. 

No, this isn't all in your head. He was really sexually aggressive and awful. I'm so sorry this happened to you.",1,,2024-12-20 20:41:17,t3_1hif1ew,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hif1ew/does_it_count_as_sa_even_if_i_didnt_say_no_or/m31bmt8/

m31g4gp,comment,,"Honestly, my first response is to let you know that you probably won't have a normal weekend, I'm really sorry. Something really scary and horrible just happened to you. A crime was committed against you.  Here's my advice for what you should probably do: 

1. GET A RAPE KIT DONE AS SOON AS YOU CAN. Go now, go fast. Look up medical practicies/charities in your area which provide a test - many SA charities will provide for you. Take the clothes that you were wearing when you were assaulted. You might feel like you never want to prosecute, but it won't hurt to have his DNA evidence in case you ever do decide that you'd like to prosecute. 

2. Phone and report to the police, if you can.

3. Tell your family what happened, if you think they'll support you. I know that you're probably feeling a lot of pressure to make it a 'good weekend' for your family, but I promise you that they'll want to know what happened. It's so much better to face the weekend with love from your family rather than feeling alone in the knowledge of what happened, feeling constantly under pressure. You need their help, love and support right now.

I felt guilty that he felt bad so I started offering we do the things that he forced me to do, even though during it I was extremely uncomfortable and felt unsafe 

So I guess what I‚Äôm asking is is that consensual? If I started it? 

Also - I felt I became very aware of when he wanted it, like hyper vigilant. So if I felt he was showing a sign I felt I had to go through with it and offer myself. But I don‚Äôt know. That can‚Äôt be abusive because he‚Äôs not actually doing anything. In fact I‚Äôm the one being overly sexual

1hiufba,post,Struggling with mental health that it affects bonds,"Tw: childhood sexual assault, slight detail




As a baby, I was raped in front of my siblings once for trying to tell my parents. I remember the traumatised looks on their faces. I later consented to sex on the condition she stop involving my siblings. It continued for years and we've experimented a lot. I feel so dirty since she's touched everywhere. I've been working on my feelings but I can't rid myself of my attachment to her. Like a permanent mark I'll be her sex toy forever.

I broke down in front of a younger friend. They got overwhelmed and haven't replied to me. It's a mistake I keep making because I don't have much support. She also seems to hate when I consider myself a sex doll or someone undeserving of her kindness. But I can't help what I truly feel. It's not just 6 years of sex I consented to. A female friend raped me in my sleep when we were both teens. I can't help but feel even more of a failure for not being the ideal strong man my family and friends need. 

I know I've been pushing myself to recover but I hate that I've made the mistake of throwing the burden onto my friends.

1hiuze3,post,"Was this sexual assault, even though they were kids too?","This happened years ago when I was in elementary school. This happened when I was around 7 years old.
I was bullied a lot during elementary school for different reasons. My bullies were really popular and I desperately wanted to have friends. 
So I just ignored when they made me feel bad, because back then I thought that friends just acted like that.
This also caused me to be easily manipulated into doing stuff for them.
So this is what I'm not sure if it's SA, because we were all kids:
Two of them cornered me in the school bathroom and made me go into a stall with them. They locked the door behind them and told me to be quiet. They told me to take off my clothes. 
I remember telling them to please not do this today, so I think this maybe happened more than once, but I can't remember clearly.
I did as they asked when I realised they wouldn't stop. I can't really remember a lot more than that. I don't think they touched me. I think they just... looked.
I can't even remember their faces properly, but I remember how ashamed I felt.
So that's what happened.
I know that kids experiment regarding their bodies and that's normal.
I just can't tell if this is also what happened here, since they were minors too or if this was SA.
I'm also unsure, because they didn't touch me or anything like that.",3,5.0,2024-12-20 22:03:00,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hiuze3/was_this_sexual_assault_even_though_they_were/

I don't think the second time sounds like abuse but I do think you need to forgive YOURSELF for offering and also for following through with the offered sex that you didn't really want to have 

As someone who has had a lot of consensual sex that I didn't really want to, let me be a reminder that you can, and MUST stop at any point the sex is not satisfying to you. 

It will fuck up your head, time and again, to have sex while wishing it was over.

I understand that in this situation there was probably some fear that he wouldn't stop even if you revoked consent.

1hiwbl6,post,How do I get over the severe anxiety of being raped?,"I hope this is the right place to ask about this, otherwise I will delete the post.

I'm a 15 year old girl, and I have severe depression and anxiety. I've never really been through any sort of trauma from what I know, and it's probably just a chemical imbalance in my brain. 

I'm extremely afraid of being sexually assaulted. I'm 5'0 and extremely weak, as a minor I don't have many rights and I'm not a very assertive or loud person. 

I've done everything I can to avoid going to doctors these days in the case that I'm left alone or put through some sort of anesthesia. I'm especially scared of being left unconscious with anyone I don't know.

I feel like hurling seeing scenes of rape or even the mention of it on TV or any sort of media. The second it pops into my head I just want to run away at that very moment. I can't stop shaking and I want to get over the fear. Or at the very least have the fear not affect me as it does. 

My parents told me it's not normal how much anxiety it causes me and I shouldn't have to worry about anyone hurting me. But my mom's the one who's told me stories of sexual assault in our family. My grandmother was molested by a priest as a child, and her father killed him after finding out.

I wish they understood how I felt about the topic instead of undermining how it affects me. I feel like dying everytime it enters my thoughts. 

Techniques taught in therapy have never helped me. My body basically has it's own mind and reacts how it wants to. No visualization techniques work because I'm not good at visualization. No grounding techniques help because I'm constantly dissociated.

How do I stop having panic attacks over it? How do I stop it myself? I'm desperate at this point. I don't want anyone to tell me I'm dramatic or tell me ""it's not as common as you think"" because it happens literally all the time, every day. I just want to feel secure, and therapy isn't helping.",1,2.0,2024-12-20 23:07:30,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hiwbl6/how_do_i_get_over_the_severe_anxiety_of_being/

m324jk7,comment,,"I‚Äôm sorry my dear. It sounds like there is not a safe space for you to share this with the folks around you. If doing something like that will only make you feel worse, you don‚Äôt have to.

I know it will be tricky, but think it‚Äôs best to come to grips with the fact that he hurt you, which he did very purposefully (just think ‚Äî you‚Äôd never do that to someone, would you?). I‚Äôm saying this namely so that you do not entrust yourself to be near him again, at least as much as possible.

These things can be so complex. You say you‚Äôd be shot for accusing him of that, who knows, I suppose maybe he feels like he‚Äôd be shot for being gay, and these sorts of deep seeded shames can manifest in really monstrous ways. It‚Äôs awful that he had something so bad inside him and chose to take it out on you. You deserve so much better than that, especially from someone who calls you their friend.

You‚Äôre going to be okay. It‚Äôs okay that this happened. Try to think of it this way: it literally does not change anything about who you are. It happened *to* you and you didn‚Äôt have any control over it. That‚Äôs the horrible part. But you‚Äôre going to be okay, and you‚Äôre going to get through it. It unfortunately did happen and it was a downright horrible thing for him to do. But you‚Äôre going to be okay now.

You don‚Äôt have to tell anyone, or you can continue to talk it through with strangers on the internet, just like many of us do here. You can actually do absolutely whatever you want and whatever makes you feel safe now. 

These issues can be especially complex for men. But I really need you to know that you‚Äôre absolutely a man. You‚Äôre extremely strong. Don‚Äôt think of it as ‚Äúthis happened *but* I‚Äôm still a man‚Äù, just think of it as perseverance. There‚Äôs no exceptions to your manhood and never will be.

You shouldn‚Äôt *have* to persevere through something so horrible but I wholeheartedly know that you can. You have a sense of brotherhood among your friends. That is a positive and manly trait. But this person did not treat you like a brother. They exploited your trust.

God willing, nothing like this will ever happen again in your lifetime. These feelings are complex and it is completely okay to have them. Just do me one massive favor and promise me that you will remember you are never ever truly alone, not in this day and age, you can call a hotline, you can come on here, you can tell someone you strongly trust, maybe a therapist, etc. But it will be essential to your health and your life that you do, when you are ready.

I mean, I don‚Äôt know how you feel about this, but you *could* beat his ass. I mean what‚Äôs he gonna say? 

I know it feels so isolating, but that‚Äôs largely because men don‚Äôt discuss these sorts of issues. But hear me when I say these things absolutely happen. They happen to men all the time, not quite as often as women but honestly almost just as much, if you can believe that. It‚Äôs just not talked about. And that‚Äôs really fucking lonely. And you deserve better. So that‚Äôs why I want to be sure you will speak when you are ready to speak, be it here, or anywhere else.

You can do this. You‚Äôre going to be completely okay. Just be kind to yourself, don‚Äôt say any mean things to yourself in your head. You‚Äôre a lovely individual with a great capacity for love and joy. You are going to do wonderfully in life.",5,,2024-12-20 23:35:34,t3_1hiwgpj,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hiwgpj/was_this_rape/m324jk7/

I would focus on recovery. You have shock, pain, & guilt swirling. How could this happen to you? Why me, why then? You have certain physical, emotional, and psychological trauma. You are clearly in dispair.  Please process it with a good friend, mentor, sibling, parent, or counselor. Professional help may be required.  You may become depressed, angry, or anxious. Please do not clam up, or flip out. It will take time to process but you will get better. Over time the pain will yield. This too shall pass. Thankfully he did not put you in the hospital, or worse. Yes this is heavy, but it could have been much, much, worse.



Overtime YOU WILL RECOVER. How will you adapt is key. At some point, if you you invest the time, and work on recovery you will return as a stronger and wiser woman.

The rape happened in 2019, and I have received ongoing counselling and mental health support since it happened.

 It was committed by an individual who I thought I could trust with my life and that itself destroys your ability to trust in other people for a while. I am working on that. 

I know when I was at my lowest I wasn't looking after myself. But even now, when i feel, no, I know, I am in a much better place.. I still do not make any effort with my appearance PURPOSELY. I do not want to look attractive to anybody. I dont want somebody being tempted. 

I dont know if that's something anyone else has had to overcome, or if I should overcome it? I used to take pride in my appearance, I used to want to look good. Now, I avoid it at all cost",3,,2024-12-20 23:42:22,t1_m324sf2,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hiwj3g/letting_yourself_go_after_sa/m325kbm/

It's so emotionally draining I want it to stop so bad, but they won't stop I get scared and freeze up and let them progress its so tiring I feel like such a slut after, and it makes me sick. They recently went the extra mile and pulled my bra down and followed it up with ""we (4-5 girls) just wanted to see what color it was"" excuse me??? Fuck you mean? I was having an anxiety attack and giggling as my other friend just watched in fucking horror and I've acted like nothing's happened since but I'm so self conscious. I have self harm scars everywhere besides my right arm, left calf and stomach, but I have a huge burn mark on my left boob from a light that overheated and I'm extremely self conscious of it and I'm all over the place, thought wise everywhere they touch I crave but I'm so scared of being seen and touched I went through grooming and sexual abuse at 10 and was being SA'd less by friends and more by my at the time boyfriend its given me a complete fear of being touched and used i physically cant cope, and I feel like ill spiral so that I'm so fucking ugly and unrecognizable that people will stay away.

But I've been blasted with a lot of trauma coming up for me I have hunch. I returned to the source of harm after being abused. I habe degraded myself in the same way those men did to me. From the outside it looks like I was asking for it and it's easy to shift blame away from the ones who raped me. 

Low self-esteem and worth have directly caused me the same amount if not more trauma for what I subjected myself to. I should have reported it. I didn't. I should have stayed away and I didn't.

1hize3c,post,i don‚Äôt remember what happened to me and i don‚Äôt know what to do. scared im going to lose my partner over it.  ,"recently me (26f) and my girlfriend (25f) went on a trip to california. we were only there for a few days and on the first day we went to a restaurant where they had bottomless mimosas. i‚Äôm not much of a drinker but we both got our own and were celebrating our vacation, and chatted about our future plans and how excited we were while eating over lunch. by the time the meal was done, somehow we had made it through what i thought was 2 pitchers of mimosas but my girlfriend recalled was 3. because they were walking around replacing them i guess i didn‚Äôt realize how much we had drank which resulted in us getting wasted very fast. our hotel was available for check in so we walked to our hotel and we both blacked out the entire walk, check in, and next 2 hours. 

the next thing i remember is im in a shirt outside my hotel room knocking, i have no pants on or any recollection of how i ended up outside the hotel room or why i would‚Äôve even left. i was anxious and embarrassed and still really drunk, i didn‚Äôt know if i was even knocking at the right door which lead me to get even more nervous so i walked to the end of the hall looking for a house keeper or someone who had a towel until i couldn‚Äôt find anyone and went back to knocking. my girlfriend wasn‚Äôt answering and at this point i was too incoherent to know what to do which was stay knock louder i suppose. at this point a man walked by the hallway, i have no recollection of his face, name, or anything else but he asked me if i needed a towel to which i said yes please and he led me down the hall to his room to give me one. when i tried to leave he kept pulling my arm to stay and then next thing i remember was he was on top of me, i know if i was sober i wouldn‚Äôt have ever let that happen and i couldn‚Äôt move or get up. he didn‚Äôt finish, and i eventually stood up and rushed out of the room and when i banged on our door again she answered and i balled my eyes out to her in the shower explaining that i don‚Äôt remember how i got locked out and i don‚Äôt know why that happened. we then got in a fight because she was puking in the bathroom the whole time and couldn‚Äôt get up and was yelling at me for being stupid. she was screaming mad asking if i was r_ped and i said i don‚Äôt know, no. she then left and started banging on the doors and went to the front desk before coming back and yelling more. i think we were both just too drunk for our own good and i wish it never happened. 

a few years ago, i went travelling and had gotten sa‚Äôd by a guy i met and i told my girlfriend about it a few months ago and it completely destroyed her, i told her i had gone to therapy for it and have been doing my best with that. now i feel stupid, embarrassed and angry that something like this happened again. it completely destroyed my girlfriend for weeks imagining something bad happening to me and i reassured her that there was nothing she could‚Äôve done because it was before we met. the next day she cried to me apologizing for yelling at me, she just was upset that she thought something bad happened to me and she wasn‚Äôt aware of it happening. i lied and said nothing happened, a guy took me to get a towel and was being creepy and then i came back and she let me in. 

 we‚Äôve been faithful to each other for over a year and i am confident i want to settle down with her and have a long future with her especially after our talk at dinner but im so terrified that by telling her what happened it‚Äôll destroy her and ruin our relationship. i came back home and went to the doctors to get tested and got blood work done and everything, im just scared that if this man i don‚Äôt remember gave me an STI, im going to have to tell her but i really want to wait until I know. it‚Äôs been really hard processing that this has happened again and it really has only been on both those two occasions ive been flat out drunk like that where i can‚Äôt function. every night since then ive laid in bed trying to remember how i got locked out, why i didn‚Äôt say no, why i didnt keep knocking and banging at the door, why i went to this man‚Äôs room. i don‚Äôt know what to do.

1hizjx6,post,was this sexual assault/molestation?,"hi, throwaway account because this is a deeply personal, and, for some reason, embarrassing experience.

when i was somewhere between the ages of (i think) 6-8, i was playing/roughhousing with my older god-brother at his house. i believe we started out downstairs in the play area with my other god-siblings and he either chased or carried me upstairs, where he then threw me onto his bed and pinned me down by my arms/wrists while i was on my back, and at some point he grabbed my ankles or feet and pulled my legs apart, and he basically stepped on my privates. the whole time we were roughhousing i was laughing and play-screaming but i do remember when he put me on the bed starting to actually struggle and feel kind of nervous, and then uncomfortable, and then confused. all of this is very choppy/foggy in my memory, as i repressed the memory of this event for years and years without realizing, and then when it did resurface i had trouble believing it had actually happened and thought i was making it up. i don't remember exactly how old he was, probably somewhere around 13, and i don't remember what happened before or after this. in the memory after he steps between my legs all i can remember is that i felt uncomfortable, and confused, and was not laughing anymore, it's almost as if i was in shock, and i can vaguely remember him beginning to move his foot around and then the memory cuts out very abruptly, like turning a tv off. i think something else - something worse - may have happened but i can't recall it. i can also sort of feel it happening in my body as i recall it. and it makes me uncomfortable, obviously. but i still don't fully know if what i do remember/know actually happened counts as sexual assault. yes it did involve my privates, and i was overpowered and touched without consent, but this was within the context of play, and i had no idea what sex was at the time, or what my god-brother's intentions were. how do i figure out if i was actually sexually assaulted?

I just don‚Äôt know if I can do it. it feels like me reporting may make my healing process go down, but at the same time I desperately want justice for what he did. ever since deciding to report, I‚Äôve been more triggered. this is the hardest thing I‚Äôve ever had to do and it‚Äôs very overwhelming. I‚Äôm worried because the process hasn‚Äôt even started and I‚Äôm already a wreck. 

I have a lot of evidence against him, including two strong witnesses, proof of attendance for an SA support group, and a message from him pretty much admitting to it. 

I am wanting to think about it like this - I‚Äôm going into 2025 taking my voice back from him. I am putting myself first. what he did was illegal and a crime, and it shouldn‚Äôt have happened. I am the one who is living the consequences of his actions, and this is incredibly unfair.

1hizv88,post, help me understand,"So this happened like a few months ago. I am f20 and my bf is m22. 

I've been in an abusive relationship with him for like 3 months now and it used to be a nice relationship but it slowly became horrible.

I first started noticing it when he was yelling at me for small things and then he began to physically hurt me when things didn't go his way. It got really bad at a point and he one time burnt my hand on our stovetop so bad that it turned like a yellowy color and felt like it was numb. 

One night when I got home I had to take my medication as I do every day when I get home. I realized almost immediately that the water tasted weird. So I asked him about it and he said he didn't know then quickly changed the topic. he asked me if I wanted to have sex which I never did before and I told him no because I was not comfortable with it and didn't like it either. He told me I would like it but again I said no. He kind of made me do it anyway and at one point I was screaming for him to stop but he didn't. I felt really weird during it like I had no control of what I was saying to him. Was I drugged or did something else happen?",1,1.0,2024-12-21 02:12:54,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hizv88/help_me_understand/

When I was in early(?) elementary my older brother touched me once, and it never happened again. About a year after it happened I just kept telling myself it was just a dream. But it couldn‚Äôt have been just a dream because I remember him trying to blackmail me or something saying he‚Äôd tell our mom if I didn‚Äôt do something for him (not sexual just him trying to manipulate me or something), which means it was real. I can‚Äôt think of any explicit details, and I know he didn‚Äòt ‚Äúrape‚Äù rape me, and I didn‚Äòt fight back in anyway. I feel stupid, I should‚Äôve said no, because now I look at my brother different. I think I may have been around seven, and he‚Äôs about five years older than me, so he would‚Äôve been twelve, and in sixth grade. I remember my mom caught him and his friend watching porn and they got in trouble, so maybe he tried to replicate something he saw with me. It still makes me sick, but I feel like it‚Äôs incredibly stupid, it‚Äôs not even rape, but I can‚Äôt forgive him. There‚Äôs been other instances of other comments he‚Äôs made that are weird. When we moved to a different state, me and him had to share an air mattress temporarily until our furniture got here. At this time I‚Äôm like thirteen, and he‚Äôs turning eighteen soon.

It starts with an r and ends with an e.‚Äù I‚Äôm laying there confused and then I realize and I‚Äôm silently panicking. I think I‚Äôm gonna be sick. Then he looks at me and he‚Äôs like ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs rope, haha I‚Äôd choke you. You know I‚Äôm just joking right?‚Äù or something like that and I‚Äôm like yeah and trying to laugh it off. I still vividly remember that. It‚Äôs just weird, we get along fine, but I can‚Äôt just put it past me.

m33i85s,comment,,"He‚Äôs definitely at fault for the first assault. The rest is murky ethically, because he probably should have been checking in with you, reading your body language, etc. Rationally‚Ä¶ most people would‚Äôve been concerned if their sexual partner was suddenly into something they hated before. Is that second part assault? Idk but it‚Äôs messed up that he didn‚Äôt hesitate and continued to just take advantage of the situation. Doesn‚Äôt sound like someone who has your best interests in mind when he made choices 

And then it sounds like you did what many survivors of SA do and tried to ‚Äúmake it okay‚Äù or ‚Äúmake it make sense‚Äù by making it seem less threatening and more controllable. or went into Fawn mode and tried to please someone some part of you was still scared of. Hyper sexuality is a common defense mechanism. Some people do it with their initial abusers, many do it with other people but it follows this same pattern you‚Äôre describing of trying to anticipate the persons needs, feeling guilty even though you did nothing wrong and did nothing to deserve the assault 

It is not a healthy dynamic but it‚Äôs understandable how people end up in it. People cope with their first instincts, then later they figure out what they really need to give themselves to heal. Common journey towards self-validation eventually. You matter and it doesn‚Äôt matter if he wants that specific thing

For months I felt I couldn‚Äôt tell anyone. I still interacted with my assaulter multiple times a week. So it‚Äôs not like I could get away from him.

Then one night one of my friends offhandedly mentioned that one of my other friends had been assaulted in a similar situation that I was. So him (the one that I was told for assulted)and I talked about it. Which allowed me to open up to some of my other friends.

The first time I told anyone the full story it was over text to my crush at the time. Within a couple months I found out he had told some of his friends and was convinced I lied about the situation.

Then I told my 3 best friends in person. I didn‚Äôt give details about the actual assault but they got everything else. There was lots of tears.

You will need to get tested at some point, and you‚Äôve got the Plan B. But even more important is if you have major injuries that you might want to get them checked out. It would be totally fair to ask if there‚Äôs a SANE (sexual assault nurse examiner) who could see you, even if you didn‚Äôt want the full exam.

When it happened to me‚Ä¶. I couldn‚Äôt sleep, I couldn‚Äôt eat, I was so confused and walked around in a cloud of exhaustion and confusion. I didn‚Äôt know how I could keep living like that. And then I got the best advice I ever heard.

You need to give yourself a week.

It‚Äôs not a week or a month or even a year to get over‚Ä¶. It might be years, it might be never, it might come and go in waves. But after one week‚Ä¶ I felt like I could finally take a deep breath again, I could see beyond the absolute fog that surrounded me.

I‚Äôm sorry to say that this isn‚Äôt going to go by easily. It‚Äôs going to suck. And there‚Äôs no way around it. The only way through is through now, there are no shortcuts. But I promise you‚Äôll be able to breathe without the weight of the entire world pressing down on you and your lungs and shoulders quite so soon.

1hj4p9t,post,I will never own my body,"I am really tired of all of this and just want to get it out there. warning for mentions of sh stuff. Also this is SA involving a minor as I am still a minor but it won't let me pick 2 tags.

My body has always been the cause of violence. I was touched and seen sexually since I was 3. I've always felt like it's my duty to perform sexually and be desirable for anyone that looks. I was blackmailed into sending pictures of my body when I was 9. I used to watch porn to learn how to make myself look 'better' when I was 11 and have always treated my body with the same violence and disrespect that people in the past have treated it with. A year ago when I was 14 I was raped and I am hopeless. I can't even believe myself when talking about all of these experiences. I know I'm telling the truth but I still feel deep within myself like I'm lying. I would tell my story with every last detail to anyone and everyone it that meant that I can be sure that what happened was actually rape. I didn't want it. I have never wanted any of this. No person that loves me can stand to look at it because the scars it has all over are just a reminder of everything that has happened to me. I can't stand to look at it and think it's mine forever and that I will never be able to get rid of it. Everytime I am sexualized I feel disgusted and like I'm doing something right at the same time. I feel like it's my place and like I am an object pretending to be human. I hate myself and my thoughts and feelings and impulses and the body I'm in. I don't think I can ever call it mine.",17,6.0,2024-12-21 07:15:51,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hj4p9t/i_will_never_own_my_body/

1hj5ygq,post,I‚Äôm just not sure anymore ,"A coworker of mine invited me to his house to look at a nice cat tree that he was giving away (I had 4 cats in my house at the time) so I said yes. I had worked with him for about 2 almost 3 years at this point, and it seemed harmless.
He said he needed to cook dinner and invited me to help cut the veggies and offered me a drink. I drank it and the next thing I remember I was on my front lawn in about 6 inches of snow, (it had snowed that night and I was covered in snow) at -20 below, in Alaska. I walked up my stairs and to my front door and fell in my coat room, busting my nose in the process because I felt like I couldn‚Äôt speak or feel my legs. I eventually ‚Äúwoke up‚Äù again and made it to my room, crawling, and tried to change into my pajamas and noticed my underwear were missing. I messaged him and asked him what happened and he said I ‚Äúbegged for it‚Äù from him. I have a pretty high tolerance for alcohol (not the point, and not necessarily something I‚Äôm proud of) but I feel like he took advantage of me. Then the next day I was getting flashbacks of him buckling me into his dirty old truck, where the seatbelt didn‚Äôt lock, and it explained the bruises on my forehead. When I asked him about it, he said I was so messed up that I was passing out in his truck and hitting my face on his dashboard. I feel like it was my fault for taking the first sip of alcohol but I don‚Äôt even remember having the next drink. I felt hazy the next day, and not hungover kind of hazy, and didn‚Äôt have my fine motor skills. I could barely even brush my teeth. I went to the hospital because I felt like I was not right physically and needed to get my nose checked and they told me that not only my vaginal area, but my anus and wrists and ankles were bruised too. I also had bite marks on my thighs and breasts. I‚Äôve been having flashbacks that feel like a bad dream but they seem too accurate. Like when he said he had to ‚Äúbasically drag (me) down the stairs‚Äù which would explain the bruises everywhere else. I guess I‚Äôm just feeling triggered because he keeps trying to Snapchat, text and message me on Facebook, and keeps saying he‚Äôs ‚Äúsorry I‚Äôm going through so much‚Äù, but I wouldn‚Äôt be if it weren‚Äôt for this bullshit. Sorry, I guess I‚Äôm just venting. I think I know the answer, but it‚Äôs a hard one to accept, especially since I‚Äôm supposed to be a mental health professional and I feel like I need professional mental health help myself.

m3485rp,comment,,"Late responses don't matter to me. I'm 14, and yeah, it's better if you don't go to detail, BUT I've read and seen worse (unfortunately) so it doesn't affect me. 

So, if you did experience any physical responses such as arousal, or if the thought that you liked it came afterward, it can occur involuntarily too. It doesn't imply that you consented to it or enjoyed it either way. These responses can confuse victims, but that doesn't mean that the assault was wanted or enjoyed. I'm not going to say anything about sexuality, but if you are really questioning it, I do recommend talking about it to someone or do some research. For example, some female victims also felt arousal while they were assaulted, but they didn't choose to feel that. It occured involuntarily since their body is reacting to certain stimulus. 

I'm not trying to scare you, but I've heard some stories where therapists don't do their job like how they're supposed to. They either make it worse or make you re-live your bad experiences again. But you can easily find that out based on if they are actually trying to help you or if they're behaving weirdly. It's highly unlikely, though. But searching for a therapist is definitely a good idea. Some victims try to keep their emotions and thoughts to themselves, and it usually goes badly later on in their lives. Make sure to take care of yourself in the meantime, and don't let any of your experiences bring you down. When you walk through the streets, you may see 'normal' people doing their own things, but you don't know what they have been through. Trauma doesn't affect appearance or the ability to live life, so don't feel disgusted with yourself or think that you're ugly. You are a beautiful human being and you arent different compared to others based on worth. Don't think about what you went through, think about the future ahead of you.",1,,2024-12-21 10:08:04,t1_m31dl8g,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hilrzt/i_need_help/m3485rp/
1hj70b3,post,My abuser is visiting for christmas and I'm terrified to see his face again,"Hi everybody! Okay first of all I'd like to put a warning that this post contains a minor molesting a minor, and that I won't be going into much detail about the assault but I'll state what acts he made me do. Now with that out of the way I'd like to start off with a few important things and a backstory! I'm \[13F\] and my uncle/abuser is \[25M\] in the present time. So It all started when I was around 4-5 and he was around 17-19 (I can't fully remember how old I was when the first time he did it but around there), I believe he was staying with me and my mom for a few months or either just babysitting me. I don't remember how it first started but all I remember is that he made me perform oral on him and jerk him off, It happened multiple times. Then a few years later when I was maybe around 7-9 when I was visiting my aunts(mom's sister) house with my mom, my abuser and another aunt(um idk how we're related I just call her aunt) with her two children around my age, it was getting late and I believe the adults were outside drinking and smoking while me, the two children and my abuser were inside. The 4 of us were goofing around and having fun until the two children got tired and wanted to relax and get ready for bed, so me and my uncle left them in the room they were staying in and went into the living room where I was staying. My uncle said that I should also head to bed and i agreed so I got ready for bed as he pulled out the bed from the couch. Once I got in bed he insisted he should lay down with me, i thought nothing of it and let him. After a few minutes he asked me ""Can you do something for me"" and I obviously said ""Sure what do you need"" Or something along the lines of that, he then guided my hand to his thingy and made me do yk what to his thingy. By this age I knew what he was doing was wrong because of other instances, but I just did what he asked of me for awhile. My mind filled with ways how to get out of the situation I was in, one being I would go to the washroom and just leave by the backdoor that was right beside the washroom and run around the house into the front where the adults were to tell them what was happening, but there's only so much courage a child that age has. After a while he asked me ""Can you do something else for me?"" I asked what and he guided me down there and yk how that goes after that, but that didn't last long because I had the great idea of telling him that I was tired, so I did. He then let me go and go to sleep. Sorry for the sorta long but necessary backstory, Now onto a present time(this year) backstory(I'll try to keep this one more short). Me and my little sister were taken away from my mother in April, placed with my aunt until my grandparents came to get us in may, now we're currently staying with them,. Rewind back to August 17, one of our cousins had passed and we came down for the funeral. Once we got there we rented a hotel room for the nights we were gonna stay, once in the room we started to relax for a few hours because we were drained from the 7ish hour drive to the little town. After around maybe 2 hours my grandparents wanted to go to the downstairs casino so they started to get ready, after they were done they said they were waiting for someone, that someone was my uncle. He came in and gave everyone a hug, including me, I was terrified, I was on the verge of tears but kept it in for the 10 minutes they were in the room till they left for the casino. Once they were gone I completely lost it. I cried for awhile until I couldn't take it(little background, I have a history of suicidal thoughts and by that time I had attempted once but failed), I called my bsf but she told me to call by cousin that was in the same hotel, but by the time he called me I had grabbed a bottle of pills that contained 40 pills they had laying around and took most of it(Leaving maybe 3). At his point in time I was unaware of how much I would actually need to od but I believed that smth would happen to me so I told my mom, my bsf and my cousin of what i did. So my mom called people in town to check up on me, after a few minutes my grandparents came bursting in and started screaming asking what I did and since I was a crying mess it took me awhile to spit it out, then they started accusing me of lying after I told them what her son did to me as a child. After that they made me hang up on my cousin and made me go lay down. A few people came knocking on our door to ask if I was okay and needed help but they would slam the door in their face, then I passed out for two hours(2am now) someone had called an ambulance for me and they answered the door, they asked to see me and they woke me up, asked if i needed help and i obviously said yes bc i didn't want to be there with people who didn't believe me, so i went to the hospital, stayed for the night, then left. One thing I find kinda fucked up is that the nurse didn't tell the police or anything like that, they only told me to go back with my grandparents, the ones i didn't want to go back to but they said i had no choice but oh well i digress. Now onto the main point of the post, my abuser is coming, he should be here today later(Dec21) or tomorrow(dec22) now i was devastated when I found out, mostly because the nurses made a deal with my grandparents that if I go back with them he couldn't come, so yea fucked up. Anyways the only thing that was kinda calming me down is that my mom was SUPPOSED to come as well but smth happened and now they don't want her to come so it'll but be him, his gf, and my aunt. I'm scared I'm gonna do smth I might regret again, I don't want to leave the people I care about but I also have handle seeing him again, i feel stuck, I don't know what to do, i know some people might try to say just tough it out for the holidays, but I can't. I don't think i can.. well anyways It's 5am and I've been waiting for over an hour now and i need some sleep bc I'm going to see a play today at 7pm! Goodnight and have a great day/night to whoever's reading this!!  
(ps this might not sound completely right but remember that it's 5am for me, I'm tired, and I'm only 13((I also don't wanna proofread so if you're confused about smth ask in me in the comments and i might respond))

1hj7fu7,post,Loss of sex drive after trying to get familiar with my body,"Hello. I've been molested for a couple of years by multiple people.

Right after the assaults my sex drive would turn incredibly high before disappearing completely and making me feel empty. The process would restart over and over again by different people and different circumstances.

I'm working with my therapist on embodiment and beating vaginismus since I don't feel like this body belongs to me, rather I see it as a mere object.

But I noticed my sex drive would start decreasing as I tried to touch my body in a non-sexual way.

It makes me feel even more useless now. It feels weird to touch it when my surroundings are oddly calm and I feel safe. It feels extremely unfamiliar and I hate it.

I've been thinking of signing up to pilates class but what if it'll complicate things even more? I seriously don't know what to do at this point. My body belonging to me should be such an easy task to understand but it's not. I feel so dumb, so sick.

If all of this is a way for my brain to relive the assaults then it picked a wrong fucking time to do so",2,3.0,2024-12-21 10:45:57,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hj7fu7/loss_of_sex_drive_after_trying_to_get_familiar/

1hj7jhs,post,Was I Raped ? ,"(Trigger warnings)

My boyfriend has sexually assaulted me twice. I will be going into a little detail of what happened to me. 

First time: I teased him but then we continued and I was fine with all of it until I had this sudden feeling of not wanting sex anymore at all so I said stop, no and did two taps on his face but he didn‚Äôt hear me or see me so I grab his face and asked him what I said then he realized what happened and ran to the other side of the bed freaking out and I went to comfort him cause I felt a little bad about it I went to try and hold it face but he pulled away and I broke down. I honestly feel like the first time is a bit my fault cause I teased him before it happened but the sound of my voice, the amount of times I said stop or no, and me pushing him should let him know I didn‚Äôt want it at all. 

Second time: he started touching me and I was fine with it but then I got that feeling of not wanting it anymore at all so I said stop and no but he didn‚Äôt and I kinda just gave up and laid there until he stopped and he only contented for a few more seconds. So when he stopped a few seconds later I asked if he heard me and he said yes so I asked why didn‚Äôt you stop and he responded with ‚Äúbecause i didn‚Äôt want to‚Äù 

Third time: we were having sex but people were home so I wanted to be quiet so I was actively listening but then I thought I heard something so I told him wait and he didn‚Äôt stop but i felt like I couldn‚Äôt say any other words like no or stop. I‚Äôve said the words wait before and he has stopped but this time he didn‚Äôt. I kept saying wait and I was trying to push him away after 5 or 6 waits I kinda felt empty and almost let him just continue but then he stopped and asked if I was okay and if I wanted to stop so I said yes and then he said sorry for not stopping but he wasn‚Äôt freaking out he was just kinda normal.

I cannot tell if I was raped the third time. I gave consent but I didn‚Äôt say stop or no when I had wanted to stop for a second to listen. I feel like it wasn‚Äôt rape cause I didn‚Äôt want to stop but I had wanted to pause I guess is what I‚Äôm trying to say.

1hj8btr,post,Raped by a coworker that I used to have a crush on,"I (21f at the time)  asked a former coworker to bring me some wine. He showed up and we were talking in his car and I started to drink the bottle. He asked to see it a few times and then would give it back to me. I had no intentions of having sex with him, to the point that I was about to lie and tell him I was on my period so that he wouldn‚Äôt want to. He grabbed my neck and choked me and started kissing me. At this point I had already had a bottle of wine and I was halfway done with the one he brought me. We moved to the back seat and I kept stalling and trying to just make conversation. Then he started kissing me and choking me again and went down on me. He told me he wouldn‚Äôt stop until I finished the bottle. He then had sex with me while choking me and slapping me in the face, giving me a black eye. The next thing I know we‚Äôre at a different location in my neighborhood and I had no idea how we got there. I went to detox the next day for my alcoholism and they blood tested me and found benzodiazepines in my system. I have never taken those in my life. Nothing else makes sense other than that he put them in the bottle when I wasn‚Äôt looking. I found out he‚Äôs in the police force so I feel like reporting it is futile. I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm sharing this, I just wanted to get it off my chest. I was drugged and taken advantage of. I got tested for any STI‚Äôs and luckily nothing showed up.

1hj8i25,post,i was groped in high school - never reported it,"i was on my way into spanish class.  he grabbed my ass quite hard/violently in the doorway.  his name was Bobby.  he was a football player.  i never had spoken to him and never did.  he was waiting for me in the doorway, out of sight.  i almost think he could've been waiting for someone else.  his girlfriend was in my class, or so i was told.  

i thought the teacher saw it.  she was the only other one in the room.  she was a supporter of the football team.  i was confused why she didn't do anything.  she watched as Bobby and I stared each other down across the room, after I ran to my seat.  She seemed to be waiting to see if things were settled or not.  She was smiling, knowingly, as if Bobby was my boyfriend or something.  I hated her for that.  

I thought, so what if i don't report it, now everyone will think he's gay.  a big hetero football guy, it will doom him with that crowd.  but i didn't care that much that it had happened to me at the time.

i had been bullied in grade school, and the school never did anything about it except punish me when i fought back and punish one of my more minor bullies.  why would the high school do anything for me now?  i stared Bobby down to see if he was gonna try to bully me about it.  he kind of stared at me plaintively, and then turned around and walked out the door.

m35nyaf,comment,,"Well yes, but I won't say it like that. It's more grooming. Betrayal isn't always grooming, but grooming does involve acts of betrayal. In my pov, betrayal is when you genuinely have a connection with someone like a kinship or romantic relationship, but break their trust or confidence later on. Grooming is more of a manipulative process where someone tries to build a relationship with the victim with the intent to exploit or abuse them. My situation fits more with grooming since it probably was exactly like that.

He treated me nicely and gave me a dozen of compliments, but he also talked very sexual to me. I guess if he wouldn't have talked so nicely to me like that, I wouldn't have engaged with him. It's like he wanted me to love him in order for him to get my photos. He randomly stopped responding one day.

i‚Äôve known him for a while but only because i used to work at the bar he frequents. i‚Äôve never known him on a personal level.

1hjeqa5,post,"My past is haunting my current sex life, help.","I (19f) with my boyfriend (20m) have been in a relationship for about a year now. Recently we have been running into problems regarding the bedroom. Throughout our talks through the relationship we discovered his love language is touch and mine is communication. 

From the beginning we were having sex, but recently both of us have noticed that I hardly ever instigate and now i mostly deny when he brings it up which I feel has put a bit of a strain on our relationship. Now, I can easily see how I am withholding from him but there's a very key detail and that is probably what I need to solve. 

My boyfriend is well aware of the fact that sex isn't very ""pleasurable"" for me, not that he's bad, it's great but. He also knows that I have been sexually assaulted in the past, and not even just once. And knows that I never got help for it and it still bothers me. I really really try my best to be in the mood sometimes but it's been 3 weeks now and he's leaving for a fam trip for 2 weeks and I just need help. 

I want him to feel loved but I don't want to force myself to. Help. (For anyone who might say that's not the only way to show/express love, I do show it in many other ways too and to try and make up for the lack of sex) 

tl:dr- I don't like sex due to my past which is currently straining my relationship, help.",2,2.0,2024-12-21 17:34:54,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hjeqa5/my_past_is_haunting_my_current_sex_life_help/

1hjf952,post,how do you deal with unsupportive friends,"For context, I have faced a lot of sexual violence throughout my life. My friend (from hereon ""friend A"") knows about this

A few months ago I told my friend A about a shitty date I went on where the guy was making me super uncomfortable and acting weird, saying a lot of sexual stuff that made me extremely uncomfortable and was telling me about his kinks and rape fantasies, even though he knew that I've been sexually abused. He was also doing and saying other stuff that crossed a lot of boundaries, like asking me about my mental illnesses and asking if I could ""parent"" him sometime (this was the first time we had ever met up irl)

After the date I rejected the guy I went on a date with (with support from friend B) and it turned into a big conflict with the guy harassing me online and saying I was ""leading him on"", acting super aggressive

When I told friend A about the date he said
""wow sounds like a bad time"" (which seemed like a very dismissive response) but then later it turned out he kind of vaguely knew the guy, after which friend A started criticizing me for how I responded to being harassed, and later ""scolded"" friend B behind my back for ""getting involved in the situation""

I told friend A that I felt genuienly unsafe around the guy I went on a date with (and at one point thought he might start trying to stalk me) but he seemed to just think I was being mean for no reason or that I was
""overreacting""

The date and the aftermath of it might even have been somewhat traumatic to me, since it happened months ago but I still feel extreme anxiety when thinking about the concept of ever going on a date again, and I've had nightmares about it

Friend A hasn't shown me any compassion around the topic and has said that I'm just sensitive around this kind of stuff because of my trauma (which seems like he's trying to weaponize my prior sexual trauma against me to try to claim I'm overreacting). He has brought it up to me out of nowhere multiple times just to start criticizing me for how I handled setting my boundaries and rejecting someone

Friend A is also a bit older than me and tends to sometimes act pretentious/condescending in general, so I don't know how to make it clear to him that he's not being a very good friend
He's otherwise usually not known for being a shitty person, and we have a lot of mutual friends so I don't know how to handle it

Does anyone have any advice or has been through something similar?",0,4.0,2024-12-21 17:58:53,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hjf952/how_do_you_deal_with_unsupportive_friends/

I (18 F) started talking to this guy I used to go to school with (18 M) and within a few hours of snap chatting he invited me over, I was tired and also wasn‚Äôt ready to do anything with him so I said another time. The next day I was so anxious I couldn‚Äôt stop throwing up, had to call out of work and felt physically sick when he texted me so I unadded him. He texted me asking why and I told him I felt bad because I wasn‚Äôt going to sleep with him, he told me it was fine and he wasn‚Äôt going to make me do anything I didn‚Äôt want to. The next night we met up at his house and within ten minutes of me being there, i was naked in his room, He pulled my shirt off with my consent but then later he just pulled off my shorts and underwear without any warning and then started fingering me. The whole time I was kind of disassociating and then would randomly realize what was happening and just stare at the ceiling. Then I gave him head and that‚Äôs when I told him I was a virgin, a few minutes later he‚Äôs moving me to the edge of the bed and then he just put it in. And then we fucked for like 7 minutes and the whole time I was just in shock? Afterwards, he told me I could hangout for a bit and so we sat in his bed and he asked me if I regretted it and I said no. When I got home I felt really weird, sat on my floor hugging myself and couldn‚Äôt stop trembling. This morning, he unadded me without saying anything and i‚Äôve been feeling so sick ever since.

1hjgfge,post,It all is pretty messed up,"i'm not even sure if i have a moral right to make this post, but i'm making it

i (f15) have an older cousin (f17 now), back ten years ago she already has discovered masturbation, i have no idea how common it is and how early people discover it, but i had no idea until she introduced me to it (we were 5 and 7 back then). one day she said she is going to show me something cool and talked and showed me through the basics, but she wanted something more and so she talked me into pleasuring each other orally, i have no idea how she discovered that. i was totally consumed by this new discovery and started pleasuring myself when i felt like it and was happy when my cousin came for a visit. however soon i think she got disappointed either with my lack of skill or that i not only wanted to please but pleased as well which she wasn't very happy to give and we soon stopped doing it after a few times.

i however couldn't abandon this new discovery and continued pleasing myself all the coming years, until middle school, that's when i felt like trying it with other girls again and that's when i started doing something horrible, i started harassing other girls, bullying them into giving orals to each other, i became an assaliant. i did realise what i was doing is horribly wrong but when horny i couldn't hold myself, i started smoking in secret, having other bullies as friends, though trying doing things consensually with my new friends i didn't even think. so it went on for a big part of middle school until two years ago i took it too far.

one of the girls i was harassing was my neighbour and on a spring of 2022 my parents invited her and her family along with some other neighbours for an outdoor party. it all was going well but small rain started to drip and everyone went inside. i saw the girl sneaking upstairs to the second floor terrace probably to have a smoke while nobody watches, i followed grabing a smoke myself. we remained silent for some time and it was annoying me for some reason, so being a horrible person i decided to remind her how it is being bullied, i started harassing her again, i didn't do anything sexual, was just insulting her lowering my voice because i saw my father coming upstairs too in a room that was leading to the terrace. the girl however was done with my bullying and stood up for herself, i got angry at it, pushed her, somehow wooden rails broke and she fell down. the height didn't look like very much but it still would be unpleasant to fall from there, unfortunately the grill and some furniture was right underneath and that's where she landed. everyone in the house rushed to her to help and i could only walk inside and start sobbing. i was scared for her, but i was more scared of her telling everyone i pushed her, telling them i assaulted her, and my dad saw everything too. i didn't know what to do, just sobbed. in a short while dad came upstairs to check on me and saw the condition i was in, he hugged me and started calming down and i told him that i don't want them to know i pushed the girl. and he said that everything is going to be okay, nobody will know anything, but it will require some effort from me and here i felt him placing a hand on my chest and a squeeze, he asked if i understand. in shock i almost stopped crying but fear of what i did coming public was terrible. i said that i do understand. actually i just nodded. he then went back downstairs to help with everything he could in the situation.

much later that day when the girl was in hospital and everybody seemed to calm down more or less i was lying down in our living room watching tv, dad approached and asked if i feel any better and was all nice and sweet, except his hand was under my shirt on my chest again, he said what i did will be our secret, and that we'll have more secrets together.

he paid all medical expenses for the girl, he bought her a new phone and anew computer, he probably gave her money directly as well, i don't know if it took him any convincing or just money and presents were enough but so far she keeps silent. i on the other hand had to explain my father a lot of things and we really have a lot of secrets. i am regularly touched by him, in these two years i've been forced to have sex with him multiple times, fear of what i did being discovered didn't go anywhere, i did have nightmares about it though recently they are quite rare. i switched to being home schooled for 6 months after the incident, i quit smoking and you can bet i am not assaulting anyone anymore. i don't have a very good grades but i am now a praised member of school volleyball team. fear of it all crumbling if any of the girls speak up makes my hands shake even now when i am typing this. and i feel stuck, with fear and with my father, because he's not going to let me go. he openly shares his kinks with me, and makes plans including them and me, saying stuff like, when your breasts grow bigger, when you start wearing x, one day we'll get you one of these things to try. but i don't want to be stuck with it, i don't want what i did to hold me by the neck my whole life and only way i see to get free is to confess, i don't know if publicly or to my relatives only. i haven't thought that far, as i said even typing this down is tough, consider this post my first step to preparing to face consequences of what i have done. confessing to the internet on a throwaway account should be much easier than telling something like this into the faces of people you love",5,4.0,2024-12-21 18:53:14,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hjgfge/it_all_is_pretty_messed_up/

1hjh0cz,post,i don't like that he is the only one who did those things,"I hate that all of intimacy is shared through a lens of him because he was the only guy I ever even held hands with. whenever I picture any form of intimacy, no matter how innocent, my brain starts to fill him in place. I had a dream where I started kinda getting assaulted? I'm not entirely sure but then the guy turned into him and I just closed my eyes and waited for it to be over in my dream. intimacy and him are almost the same thing in my brain and so wanting intimacy feels like wanting him and I don't ever want to see him again so then I feel guilty. and then I want to ""dethrone him"" and just go find some random guy who I can replace intimate memories with and have someone else's face there. I know its incredibly unwise and I shouldn't do it but I feel so desperate sometimes. I want to feel better. but mistreatment feels like love so when I'm not being mistreated I don't feel very loved. it just sucks. and I never had sex with my ex, only about everything leading up to it, so what guy is gonna want to be mostly intimate with me if I draw the line? so either he won't listen to the line and I'll just get raped or he won't want me at all. I just want to feel better. I want physical intimacy but I don't know how to get it without destroying myself ",8,1.0,2024-12-21 19:20:33,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hjh0cz/i_dont_like_that_he_is_the_only_one_who_did_those/

1hjip97,post,I feel like everyone has always perceived me as a slut,"I‚Äôm 17F but even when I was as young as 8 and didn‚Äôt even start puberty or feel or know anything sexual it‚Äôs like I‚Äôve been seen as some sort of object.

I‚Äôm not good looking and have never been so it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm just really hot and people can‚Äôt keep their hands and words off me. No it‚Äôs like everyone thinks I‚Äôm some sex thing. I have been raped and assaulted and just been treated not nice sexually most of my life.

Like literally most recently I had started college (uk) and a complete stranger made a rumour about me having sex with this way older student knowing he‚Äôs a rapist. And lost of people believed it. I don‚Äôt even like the guy and I didn‚Äôt even know about the rape allegations made against him. And all of this was being spread like I‚Äôm some slut all because I spoke to him nicely one time because I just was trying to be nice to everyone and make friends we weren‚Äôt even flirting or anything I literally just was saying hi as I was with everyone. I ended up quitting college because it got so bad and people are still posting me online calling me a slut. 

I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing I don‚Äôt ‚Äúact‚Äù sexual in public I don‚Äôt do anything to imply that. But ever since I was 8 I‚Äôve been raped so many times and assaulted so many times and had awful sexual things said about me so many times that I‚Äôm just confused. It makes being sexual difficult. I feel a lot of guilt and anxiety when I have sex or flirt or even on my own. If I am sexual in any way I feel gross and afterwards I feel so depressed and worthless and suicidal.

These past few weeks I‚Äôve been posting more provocative things on my social media‚Äôs and the bullying has actually gone down for some reason. So I don‚Äôt know maybe because they know I know I‚Äôm a slut and everyone knows I‚Äôm a slut so why bother mention it anymore. Everyone can see how gross I am already.",6,2.0,2024-12-21 20:42:48,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hjip97/i_feel_like_everyone_has_always_perceived_me_as_a/

m37gtfm,comment,,"Sorry but with respect I honestly don‚Äôt see how you can even come to this conclusion that you think that the OP was sexually assaulted just because the OP didn‚Äôt consent to any of this and that the male was far more sober than the OP?

The reasons why I say this is because first of all the OP clearly says that she was extremely drunk.  If the OP was extremely drunk then she could never give her consent to the male anyway due to the OP being intoxicated, so your initial point and basis that the OP was sexually assaulted here by the male because she didn‚Äôt give him her consent is completely irrelevant because she couldn‚Äôt possibly give him her consent anyway, even if she wanted to or even if she verbally told him that she does consent.

The second issue I have here with what you have said in your comment that the OP was sexually assaulted by the male on the basis that he was far more sober than the OP is also not of sound basis.  Consent is not defined or determined by who is more sober than the other person.  Just because one person might be drunker than the other or one person might be more sober than the other that doesn‚Äôt mean that the person who is the least drunk or the most sober (both the same thing) is the  actually committing sexual assault or rape in that situation.  

In addition to that the OP stated that she was extremely drunk but she also clearly stated that the male was also drunk too ‚Äòbut she didn‚Äôt know how drunk he was‚Äô the OP also said later on in her post ‚Äòthat they were both drunk‚Äô so I really don‚Äôt understand how you even managed to come to the conclusion that the male was far more sober than the OP was, because absolutely nowhere in the OP‚Äôs original post did she say anything like the male was more sober than she was, she also said that she didn‚Äôt know how drunk the male was, so how did you even come to the conclusion that he was more sober than the OP? 

And finally the OP said in her post that she was extremely drunk and that he, the male, was also drunk but she doesn‚Äôt know how drunk he was, then the bottom line here is that neither of them were able to give their own consent to each other to engage with each other in any kind of intimacy or sexual activity or sexual acts.

To the OP, in answer to your original question as to whether you were sexually assaulted here or not by this male, the honest answer, which might not be the answer that you want to hear is that in my personal opinion No he didn‚Äôt sexually assault you here as per the description of events that you outlined in your post above.  That doesn‚Äôt mean to say OP that the way you feel and the emotions of that you have about all of this and what happened, your shock, disgust, nausea etc etc are not justified and not valid because they are, they totally are and they are also all completely natural and understandable feelings and emotions that you are having and experiencing when you take into account and consideration what you also said in your post about how you have never ever been into him and that you didn‚Äôt want to kiss him and that you wouldn‚Äôt have done any of this if you were sober.

However both the law and the principles of consent are very clear here and based upon the information that you have provided in your post describing everything that happened here then it would be determined that this male didn‚Äôt sexually assault you.  

(On a totally unrelated note, I do personally feel very uncomfortable with regards to this males ‚Äòover eager‚Äô so to speak,conduct and behaviour here in this whole situation, where he was clearly the ‚Äòdriving force‚Äô and party in all of this)

The first time I didn't trust my ""gut feeling"" about him and I ended up getting hurt. The second time I knew smth was gonna happen and it did. I was at a restaurant, buffet style, and I saw a man: blonde, rosey cheeks, 5'8ish. We made eye contact and my body told me do not be alone with that man. I almost had a panic attack because every time I went up for more food he stared at me. We made eye contacts twice more...I feel wrong about feeling that way, specially because I've been told, (by my abuser) that I need to ""Stop ruining innocent men's lives""

1hjo9fj,post,My birth mother SA‚Äôd me and my sibling for 14 years,"I, (21 Transgender Man) was sexually assulted by the woman who gave birth to me for 14 years. She forced me and my older sibling (25 Nonbinary) to preform sexual acts on each other, and recorded us during. 

I‚Äôm in therapy for my childhood sexual abuse, and recently my therapist said something to me that really stuck with me. She told me that I didn‚Äôt have to tell people if I wanted, that‚Äôs it was my story to decide if I wanted to share. That made me realize that I do want to share, I want everyone to know what she did to me. I‚Äôve never heard any story like mine, and I need to know I‚Äôm not alone. So hear my story. I wasn‚Äôt sure if I should post this on r/MSSAbuse or r/MDSA, so I‚Äôll be posting this to both. 

I don‚Äôt know how young I was when she started touching me, but I assume I must have been an infant. My birth is on tape, my birth mother (41W) insisted it be recorded. Out of 5 children (me being the middle child), I was the only one whose birth was recorded. I was also the only one assigned female at birth. Before I went no contact who would call me to tell me about how she had edited and watched the tape many times over.

My earliest memories all involve her touching me and my sibling. I use to lie and my my first memory was of me seeing a double rainbow when I was 3. In reality I have two memories before that point, from when I was 2. In the first memory, my birth mother forced me to preform oral sex on my sibling. While she recorded us with the same camera that recorded my birth. In the 2nd memory she inserted her fingers inside me while I was taking a bath. When she was finished, she put her finger to her lips and told me to keep quiet.

This abuse continued for years. She would sneak into my room at night and assault me while she thought I was sleeping. I had issues falling asleep, and often faked being asleep during. She would bring my sibling into the room and forced them to assault me while she watched. One time my sibling had said no, that they didn‚Äôt want to touch me, they got slapped and kicked out of the room. She assaulted me more violently than usual that night. 

She would often put objects inside me, using anything even mildly phallic. I got constant yeast infections as a kid. For most of my childhood I thought I was normal for my private parts to burn. To feel pain or discomfort down there was an everyday occurrence. It never even occurred to me that what she was doing what was wrong. As a kid it was the only ‚Äúlove‚Äù I got from her. 

She controlled my body and was upset whenever it would mature and age with time. She told me I wasn‚Äôt allowed to shave. When I got my period she was upset about, just handed me a pad and went to her room, didn‚Äôt see her for the rest of the night. She wouldn‚Äôt teach me how to cook, sew or even sweep, she wanted me to remain a kid forever. To be reliant on her forever.

Everything changed as I got older. When I was 14 was the last time she touched me. I had started to get too old for her. Soon after I came out as transgender, she tried to convince I was a lesbian. She wouldn‚Äôt even let me cut my hair short until I said I was a lesbian, even though I‚Äôve never had attraction for women. 

From the second I was born I was nothing more than a sexual object to her. I‚Äôm still coping with the grief of the childhood and mother I never got. I haven‚Äôt spoken to her in over 2 years now. Thought she recently reached out to me, and it brought back so many feelings. I have blocked her and I plan to continue to do so. Though I often feel so alone in my experience. I don‚Äôt wish what I went through on anyone else. However I also feel that what I went through is so specific that no one can relate. 

I‚Äôve made so much progress in healing from this, and this is one more step I feel like I need to take. I need community, and I can‚Äôt find it in my city, so I came here instead.

1hjp907,post,My partners brother is a rapist.,"
I hate his brothers, but for good reason. My partners ex cheated on him with one brother, and his other brother is a rapist. I've never met either of them and don't want to, he understands that and respects it. My own brother is also a rapist, but he's in jail, so I understand its not as easy for my partner bc he lives with his brother and is forced to get along with him. Ik his family doesnt treat him well, but then guilt trip him into spending time with them. So I get why he still spends time with his brothers, despite what they've done. But every time I text him and he says he's smoking w/ his siblings, my heart drops. I'm not gonna tell him not to be around them bc thats his personal business with his family, but how do i get over the feeling it gives me?

I've been SA'd before, so I guess that adds to the reason his one brother being mentioned bothers me. Ik its not my partners fault, he can't choose his family, and he can't just move out. But I get so uncomfortable with the fact that he's casually hanging out with a rapist. I hate my brother for what he did to someone else. I hated him before something like that even happened to me, so its not like i only care bc I've experienced it. He's said that he's basically forced to hang out with them, and I want to believe thats all it is, but it doesn't rlly seem to bother him. He never talks about it, except the one time he told me what his brother did, and another time when I had to explain that I didn't want to meet him bc of that. I just don't know how to get past this.

I also don't understand how he can forgive his other brother for cheating w/ his ex, I'm pissed on his behalf still. But thats more of a personal family issue ig, not a moral issue like the thing with his other brother is.",2,2.0,2024-12-22 02:28:51,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hjp907/my_partners_brother_is_a_rapist/

1hjqt6r,post,My exs current boyfriend sexually assaulted me ,"I (18 F) remained friends with my ex (18 F) after our break up. It just wasn't the right fit. I became friends with her new boyfriend (18 M). We became all pretty close and I trusted them both. Fast forward a few months and he decides to host a sleep over with our DnD party. I arrived early to help prepare food and the campaign we were going to start. As soon as I got into his home and my mother drive away, he grabbed me by the back of my neck and slammed me into the floor. Ge was choking me. I was in complete shock, sure he had made passes at me before but I assumed they were just friendly jokes, considering he had a girlfriend. He had touched me in several places, I had tried to fight him off as best as I could, but it was futile. Before he could go any further one of our party members showed up. He let go of me and I ran to his bathroom and locked the door. I didn't leave though. I was too ashamed. After about 30 minutes of me panicking and crying I pulled myself together. I returned to see everyone had arrived.

 I just went to the kitchen and started cooking, ignoring everyone else. I avoided him for as long as possible, but I couldn't leave. I live outside the city and had no way home. I was stuck till the same time the next day, 24 hours. Long I know but we were going to do a campaign. I was just quiet the whole time. At one point I was in his basement grabbing something a friend asked me to get and he had followed me down. I stayed quiet. He cornered me and touched me some more, made me touch him. I was crying again, it stopped when some called for him upstairs. He left and I stayed in the basement. He didn't try anything else that day, but I was the last one to leave the next day. My mom was late picking me up. He tried again, I was saved by my mother calling me to grab my shit and be ready. I was crying my mother assumed news because of my cat allergy and he has 4 cats. I try to avoid him as much as possible after that, but any chance he got alone with me he took. Eventually I completely withdrew myself from everyone in the friend group. Avoiding school and hangouts. 

This all happened in May of 2024. He was not the first to sexually assault me, and he wasn't the last. There have been 3 more times, most recently last month. Long story short my coworker (31 M) was constantly sexually harassing me, and it turned to assault. I reported him to my manager, who was furious.  My manager stood up for me, but of course our boss was related to the guy that sexually assaulted me. I ended up getting fired because I was purposely starting drama. I know this bit is off track but I felt the need to get it off my chest.",1,3.0,2024-12-22 04:04:42,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hjqt6r/my_exs_current_boyfriend_sexually_assaulted_me/

1hjqyok,post,Why can‚Äôt I get over the ex that assaulted & traumatized me?,"My first love assaulted me when I was 16 (19 now). She (trans girl) coerced me into having penetrative sex without a condom and I wasn‚Äôt on bc. It lasted probably 20 seconds before I freaked out and made her get out, afraid that I was going to get pregnant. I ended up being horrified for the next 6 months that I somehow got pregnant, but I didn‚Äôt tell her or anyone about it, so I was dealing with it by myself. On top of that, towards the end of our relationship the first breakup, she was trying to pressure me into an open relationship because I didn‚Äôt want to have sex with her anymore. She also ended up fucking/getting with one of my best friends four months after we broke up. I freaked out about that and made them break up and the whole situation was extremely distressing. We ended up getting back together a month later. When I did eventually tell her about it, I made it seem like she didn‚Äôt assault me, so she never got the amount of guilt about it she should feel. When I broke up with her a few months later she called me psycho about how I handled her and my friend getting together. She also often got mad at me for not wanting to have sex with her and not wanting to make out and stuff. Now, two and a half years later, two relationships later, and after figuring out that I probably have PTSD from all of that, I still find myself missing her and wanting to go back to her, even though she was an awful parter. I did and still find myself missing the relationship before she assaulted me. All today and yesterday I was stalking her instagram, and rereading our text arguments. The only way I was able to stop thinking of wanting to get back with her was triggering myself, and now that it‚Äôs passed I feel the feeling of wanting to contact her coming back again. I know logically that it won‚Äôt be what I want, and it‚Äôll be the same as last time, and that it‚Äôs a horrible idea. I can‚Äôt shake it though. I don‚Äôt know if this is the right place to post this, but if anyone has any advice on how to move past it or why I feel like this, I‚Äôd appreciate it.

so for some context, i grew up in a good loving family (i think?) i can‚Äôt remember most of my childhood. I had horrible social anxiety. When I was 10 I was assaulted by a boy in my class. And when I was 6 or 7 I would shower with my mom but my brother always got to shower with my dad. I felt jealous and was always a daddy‚Äôs girl. I cried my eyes out until they let me take one last shower with him. I felt awkward when it came to that night. My mom encouraged me and I didn‚Äôt want to change my mind and upset anyone.

I don‚Äôt know if any of this is important but I always feel so vulnerable and uncomfortable at home, I cover up a lot and feel self aware of my body. 

Now I‚Äôm home from university for christmas and i feel disgusting. I feel like crying and I hate being back in this house and all those feelings are coming back. I feel vulnerable and uncomfortable, I‚Äôve covered my whole body. Is this normal? Am I overreacting? I don‚Äôt know. And is it normal to not remember my childhood? Sorry if none of this is relevant, I didn‚Äôt mean to waste anyone‚Äôs time. ",0,10.0,2024-12-22 04:27:57,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hjr65f/am_i_overreacting/

1hjsdc0,post,does it count as sexual assault if i gave consent,"about 3 months ago i was hanging out w my gf at my house. during that entire time, she was constantly begging me to do sexual stuff with her. i kept saying no over nd over again and making it clear that i was uncomfortable, but she didnt rlly accept that and continued to beg and complain. when we went to the mall later that day, she kept trying to make me go to the bathroom w her so we could do stuff even when i kept saying no. when we arrived back at my house, she was acting cold towards me and complained abt bejng bored. she seemed upset with me for still not consenting, even though at that point she knew that i was really nauseous and not in the mood at all. i was on the verge of tears at that point and i felt like i had no other choice but to let her finger me cuz i was feeling pressured and i didnt want her to be upset with me. she acted the same all the other times we've hungout too. shes never really accepted me saying no, which always made me feel guilty and like i was a bad girlfriend for not letting her do stuff to me",12,5.0,2024-12-22 05:47:14,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hjsdc0/does_it_count_as_sexual_assault_if_i_gave_consent/

1hjsjdr,post,I think I have been sexually assaulted,"I will go straight to the point. 
I (19F) have a boyfriend (21M). Yesterday he came over and one thing led to another and I was giving him oral. Usually when we do this, I take some 1min breaks, because it's really tiring sometimes and he has always been okay with that. Another thing we do is he pushes my head so I'm at the rhythm he enjoys (this was talked about before and it is easier for me, I asked him to do this).
Well, while I was doing it yesterday, I started choking so I tapped him on the hip and pulled away. Well, not even 1 second passed and he pushed it inside and finished. 
I was very caught of guard because he has never done this before and he is the only guy that has actually ever treated me well. 
I was obviously upset and he was extremely apologetic, he said he got caught in the moment and I guess I understand.
We talked about it and I thought I was okay but I haven't been able to stop thinking about it. I had so much trouble sleeping and now I woke up in the middle of the night so anxious that I threw up.
I don't know if I'm upset at what happened or like, what the situation itself means. 
I know that if it was someone else telling me this story I would say it was SA, but I don't know. 
At that moment I felt used, like an object. Like I was just there to please him and my well being was irrelevant. 
I KNOW he regretted it a lot I really do, he didn't mean to do it. I think I'm just nervous because it happened so recently. ",1,1.0,2024-12-22 05:59:10,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hjsjdr/i_think_i_have_been_sexually_assaulted/

It‚Äôs a pretty unpleasant memory for me, though I don‚Äôt hold it against this person at all and we have a great relationship now. 

I had therapy for unrelated reasons about a year ago and when this got brought up, the therapist said ‚Äúoh, that‚Äôs just kids being kids!‚Äù but even so, it still feels really disgusting.

1hjtu09,post,I can‚Äôt trust men anymore.,"I‚Äôm 21 and I identify as genderfluid but I‚Äôm more feminine presenting. Anyways, in third grade my teacher would pick on me for I don‚Äôt know what reasons and it was a hard year for me. One day I was trying to focus in math lessons when I felt a hand in my pants. I was 10/11 years old. The kid next to me was Alex, he was the popular kid and he was feeling me. I didn‚Äôt know what to do but I knew it was wrong. I wanted to tell the teacher but I was afraid she would make fun of me or not believe me. And I was afraid the girls in my class wouldn‚Äôt like me because almost all of them liked him especially my best friend. So I didn‚Äôt tell anyone. After this, when I was a freshman in HS I grew an attraction to older men. But I dated some guys my age. I couldn‚Äôt date a Mexican guy. I dated two but every time I did it felt like I was being SA. Alex was Mexican btw. I‚Äôm Mexican too. After high school my relationships failed and I felt forced to date people my age. Skipping to when I‚Äôm 20 and I worked as a supervisor for janitors for schools. A lot of my employees were older men and women around their 30s,40s,50s and 60s. I really liked that job and at that time I hate to admit but I was in a relationship with an older man. He was in his 50s.
Anyways one day I was in this room alone with one of my employees that I enjoyed talking to. He was a Mexican man in his early 50s. Well that day I had a gut feeling something bad was going to happen. But I didn‚Äôt want to believe it. And it happened. He was standing behind me while I was sitting down and he kissed me three times on my neck. I don‚Äôt remember what he told me, so I looked back in my notes now and this was on April 14 2023. A few days before my birthday. I was frozen and shocked. I never flirted with this man and I remember he would always ask for a hug or a kiss but I told him that was inappropriate. I was naive back then and I liked to think good of people. After he kissed me I told him I was leaving. And that‚Äôs when he stopped me and hugged me. He hugged me tight I assume so he can feel my breast against his chest. Mind you I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5 and he‚Äôs like 5‚Äô2. I could also feel he was aroused.
I reported this incident a few months after to HR and then quit shortly after.
But before this I did tell my partner at the time and he was mad that this happened. I remember there was a time we were trying to do something together in bed but I was very uncomfortable and it felt wrong so I told him to stop so he did. I broke up with him shortly after. He was a Puerto Rican man but now men who‚Äôre as skinny as him kind of scare me. He was an older man willing to date a 19 year old girl.
I was 20 then and that‚Äôs when I got in situationship with another older man. Situationship because we were only messing with each other and he was married with kids, kids my age. He was 45. And his daughter‚Äôs name was the same as mine. Super weird. But the lust consumed me. I will always regret giving him any attention. I told him about my SA and I felt like he took advantage of me by trying to pity me and talking to me. One day we were doing it and I told him to stop and he kept going and I had to push him off and told him that I said to stop. He put his hands up and said okay. I don‚Äôt know if this is SA btw?? He was a Guatemalan man. The reason why I‚Äôm listing their ethnicities is because I know it‚Äôs bad but I just don‚Äôt feel comfortable around Hispanic men.
I have a boyfriend and he‚Äôs just a year older than me. He came just when I was giving up on love and he‚Äôs the only reason why I got out the situation ship. He told me I haven‚Äôt completely processed and gotten over my trauma with everything that happened to me especially with older men. And that this is why I‚Äôm so harsh on men but on him too. I always remember what he told me. ‚ÄúYou just see me like any other man.‚Äù Ever since I gotten in a relationship with him I ignore other men I barely even respond to them and most of all I don‚Äôt really like showing them my kindness. It made me really become untrusting of others. I‚Äôve become so cold. I don‚Äôt know if I can get over this or if I should even? It‚Äôs good that I don‚Äôt be so trusting of people but I don‚Äôt want to a grey person my whole life. Especially not to my partner.",3,1.0,2024-12-22 07:35:29,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hjtu09/i_cant_trust_men_anymore/

1hjukhl,post,he Gray Area Between Drunk Making Out and SA,"I‚Äôm feeling super conflicted, and I‚Äôm hoping some of you might have some insight on how to move forward.

**Background:** I have a friend (let‚Äôs call him K), I find him attractive and we‚Äôve had some flirtatious moments in the past‚Äîboth sober and drunk. In the past, we've talked about hanging out together and watching a movie drunk.

**Before the Incident:** We got dinner together and I said something to him about staying over or something similar and he expressed apprehension that my boyfriend wouldn‚Äôt like it. I remember he previously mentioned having presents for his friends. My club on campus just had a Christmas gift-wrapping event and I had leftover wrapping paper I wanted to give him. I also had a bottle of Vodka that was 40% APV. After dinner, he seemed to try to head back to his place, but then I was like, ‚ÄúWait don‚Äôt you want to go back to my place to get the wrapping paper and try the Vodka?‚Äù.¬†He agreed and we ended up going back to my place and then after that. When he was there, we tried the Vodka.¬†While he was over, we talked about me going over to his place and he expressed some apprehension toward having me over because of my boyfriend; I even asked him if he wanted to stay with me at my place and he said no because of my boyfriend. I feel like I kind of encouraged him to let me stay over because I told him my boyfriend would be okay with it. 

**What Happened:** After spending \~10 minutes at my place. We walked to his place to start drinking. We drank a lot‚Äîpretty much the whole bottle of vodka. K started cursing a lot, which is unusual for him, and I took it as a sign he was very drunk. He kept trying to get me to drink more but kept saying things like, ‚ÄúNo pressure.‚Äù I ended up climbing in his bed to sleep and I vaguely remember him also climbing in his bed. 

I dozed off and woke up to K on top of me, shoving his tongue in my mouth. While I initially kissed him back, I don't remember explicitly consenting to anything.  At one point, I told him to get off of me because he was putting all his weight on me which was physically uncomfortable and painful for me. I kept telling him to get off because of that. However, I don‚Äôt remember if I specified that it was purely because of him putting his entire weight on me. So it‚Äôs possible I could‚Äôve just been saying ‚ÄúGet off‚Äù and he ignored it.¬† We continued to make out several more times and I could sworn he said to me, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so hot‚Äù and he kept saying that he should sleep on the floor to make sure nothing happened between us. He also kept calling me a bitch.

I woke up with him passed out next to me in his bed. I got sick and started throwing up in his bed, and then in his bathroom. I tried waking him up but he didn‚Äôt wake up, so I ended up being walked back to my dorm by someone from my building.

The next day, I woke up at around 2 pm to a message K sent me on Snapchat saying, asking if I wanted to grab brunch and chat. He sent that at around 9:30 am. I responded at about 3 pm, telling him yes but then we ended up not doing anything that day. 

The day after that, he sent me just a single snap of something random. The day after that, he texted me hen asked how my studying was going. I said it was going fine. He asked if I wanted to get food with him. I said no. 

**A Few Days Later:** I called K and told him everything. He said he didn‚Äôt remember but at the same time, I don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs telling the truth. I started by telling him what happened on Friday night wasn‚Äôt okay. I asked him if he remembered me climbing into his bed and how I vaguely remember him climbing into it too. He said it started to get fuzzy. I started to sob telling him about how he climbed on top of me and shoved his tongue in my mouth (he seemed surprised and remorseful). Then I recounted the whole story about how I tried pushing him off telling him to get off of me and how he kept getting back on me. 

I told him how he called me a bitch several times. I recounted the rest of the story about how I fell asleep and vomited everywhere. Then about how I was able to go to the front desk and get walked back to my dorm. I don‚Äôt really believe him when he says he doesn‚Äôt remember anything. It‚Äôs possible he remembered but was hoping I wouldn‚Äôt remember. I feel like he was apologizing because he was sorry he was caught. Something tells me he‚Äôs done this before or something like this has happened before. 

He seemed very remorseful and kept saying he was sorry. He also swore a bit and he never usually swears. He thanked me for calling him and said he was proud of me for calling, ‚ÄúI know you probably don‚Äôt want to hear this from me but I‚Äôm proud of you for calling. I wouldn‚Äôt have called‚Äù. He said, ‚ÄúYou probably hate my guts‚Äù. He asked if I wanted him to stop texting and I said yes. He also told me he believed me and that none of it was my fault and that it was all his fault. He even asked if there was anything he could do for me. He also told me like, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre probably traumatized‚Äù. I told him a couple of times that I needed space and he replied with shit like, ‚Äú100%‚Äù. He seemed pretty respectful to me saying I needed space.

**A Few Days After That:** Two days after I confronted K over the phone, I ran into K on campus, and I got super anxious. I didn‚Äôt know what to do or how to act, so I ended up whispering to a friend about what happened, which I‚Äôm sure he overheard. Since then, I‚Äôve been thinking about the situation a lot. I‚Äôve met with the Title IX office and a Victim Advocate, but I still don‚Äôt know what to do next. The Victim Advocate advised me I tried to talk with K in person so I  texted K asking if we could meet up to talk about it, but he said he was going home for Winter break. 

**Where I Am Now:** I‚Äôve told all my friends about what happened, and they‚Äôre all upset with K. They‚Äôre telling me to cut him off for good, and I‚Äôm scared that if I try to be friends with him again, it could be unhealthy for me. At the same time, I‚Äôm still thinking about K‚Äîwhat he‚Äôs feeling, what he‚Äôs thinking. I‚Äôm struggling with whether I should just let it go, distance myself completely, or try to talk things out with him again. I was thinking about meeting up with him in person after the break, seeing how he acts, and then deciding whether or not to go through with the Title IX investigation.

Should I confront him again? Should I even consider being friends with him after everything? I do kind of, sort of forgive him but at the same time...not really. I don't even know if this is considered sexual assault especially since I kissed him back and am attracted to him.",0,2.0,2024-12-22 08:34:08,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hjukhl/he_gray_area_between_drunk_making_out_and_sa/
1hjup14,post,i have clear sexual trauma issues but i dont fully understand why,"when i was in grade 4, i had some kid a grade above me touch me through my clothes. under the guise of just roleplaying, because i was a super naive autistic kid i didnt understand. it wasnt even super invasive but the makes me feel like an embarassment. thats the only thing i know thats happened to me. i know trauma is the reaction not the event but i dont feel like its enough. 

my mother was super super afraid of me or my sister being sexually abused aswell. im extremely afraid of intimacy now. i dont know if its just from that guy or just her paranoia around sex. she would basically always say sex is bad and evil and i just got to a point i blocked out ever being in a relationship with anyone. so im wondering if the intense fear of others might be more emotional sexual abuse? or fear mongering i dont know what this even is called.

in around 2018 i had a gf and we tried having sex and i just froze and said no. and maybe im asexual but i cant tell. i havent had a partner since i broke up with her in 2019.

I don't think anyone is capable of genuinely livieng me in a pure way. all I'll ever find are abusive guys who want sex. I'm too broken for a decent guy to have any interest in me. why would a good guy want me after everything that happened to me? I'm just a shell of my former self. there isn't any of me left to love.

the other day, i finally worked up the courage to tell some of my friends what had happened, and they were all very supportive. last night, i was at a party with those and a few other friends, and we were playing a drinking game, and they were mostly avoiding questions about sex that came up when it came to my turn, but a question got asked to the group about sex, and i just sorta laughed awkwardly and ignored the question. my friend then decided to make a joke about MY sexual assault to the whole group, some of who i hadn‚Äôt even told what had happened.

i feel so disgusting. i feel stupid for trusting them, for believing they wouldn‚Äôt tell anyone, and for believing they‚Äôd have enough respect for me to not make jokes about something like that. it really hurt, and i don‚Äôt even know what to say to them.

1hjvund,post,I wrote my abuser a message on Facebook after almost 18 years.,"I wrote my abuser a message on Facebook after almost 18 years.

Trigger warning *sexual assault and self harm*

When I was 13 my mothers partner *at the time* sexually assaulted me. My mum was told the following morning and he was kicked out that day and the police were called. There were multiple instances (weird things like me seeing a camera phone under my door, i did tell my mother and she had checked his phone and there was nothing on there) that lead up to this that I had brought up and I still to this day, feel crazy about those things. 

I had a protective order put on me but nothing ever happened as he left the state and there was issues with bringing him back. 

I've suffered with mental illness from 13 onwards. I've been diagnosed with ptsd, others have said it's complex ptsd, depression, borderline personality disorder and recently have been on the possible add in of bipolar 2.

Trying to work on my mental health and be better for my own family as I'm 31 now with 2 kids and a partner who all have to deal with my moods and trauma. 

I thought it might help with the anger to message him. Tell him what he did. The pain and mental health issues I have had from what he did. In plain and simple terms. I wasn't nice at the end. I don't feel he deserves any forgiveness. He got away with sexually assaulting not just me but his own biological daughter also which came to light after my own did. 

My message:


I want you to know that because of what you did, I am still trying to fix the damage you caused till this day. I was a child. You were my step father. You altered my life in ways I'm still dealing with. I was 13. I'm now 31. I've had alcohol and drug problems since I was 13, ptsd, depression and a whole mess of mood disorders because of the trauma you inflicted on me and through me, onto the rest of my sisters and family. Your own daughter. I used to relate to you because my mind couldn't wrap my head around what you did. Because I had my own alcohol issues and that must have been why you did what you did. Because you were drunk. That was before I knew you had done it to your daughter for years before me. Did you think I was her. Or my mum. You did try to fuck my mother right after. After you left our room, spewing all over my things. Im not even sure what I want out of this. I mainly want you to understand the hurt and pain. The rage you've caused. The rage you caused in me. You're actions. That you were wrong. You are a disgusting person. You got away with sexually assaulting both your own daughter and myself. You got to move on with your life like nothing happened pretending that you arent who you are. Without judgement, without people knowing and or believing what you did. Who knows how many others in your new relationships after my mother kicked you out. For most of my life I've hated myself because of what you did. The little things that lead up to it that made me feel unsafe and also crazy. Ive tried to kill myself multiple times throughout my life because of what you did. I hope you realise the damage you've done to me and the other people that were in your life. We still deal with it daily. I hope you look at yourself as the monster you are because of the things you've done. I truly hope you find no happiness in life. I hope you die alone with noone caring that you're gone. 


I was blocked. Which was. Well expected. I had sent the message to both him and his current partner. 

She has 5 kids I think. And then they have 1 or 2 I'm not sure. I haven't seen this man for 18 years aside from him popping up on my Facebook friend suggestions. *thanks fb!*

She has daughters. She seen my message and hearted it. Never responded and by the end of the day they had both blocked me. I know part of me wants to be this vengeful person and send it to everyone on their list. I probably won't. But I feel I need her kids to know. Or at least the older ones. I know he's probably said the same thing he said about his daughter. He tells people that his daughters mum poisoned her and made her say what she says (her mother isnt around to defend that either as she commited suicide before they came into our lives). I know this is not true because he did it to me. She has a lot of the same mental health issues as me also due to trauma.

I feel like I have a duty to warn them. Because their mother is obviously either a shitty person or for some reason is in denial and believes the bullshit he spews.

I mean even if I sent it. They could very well choose to believe whatever they want. I just think of those girls. She has 3 or 4 daughters. 

The message above was and would be addressed to his name. I think i initially sent/wrote the message to offload some of the hate and rage I've been carrying around all my life. 

Should I message her older kids so they are aware.

I should add, maybe I'd change the message to be age appropriate. Her older kids look to be late teens. The youngest could be around 4 or 5. I just know he was doing this to his own from about the age of 5 and myself at 13.",13,3.0,2024-12-22 10:18:11,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hjvund/i_wrote_my_abuser_a_message_on_facebook_after/

1hjwrea,post,Woke up with terrible anxiety and flashbacks from my assault.,"It‚Äôs been getting easier to deal with but it gets scary, his face just pops up in my head and images from what happened does too and it‚Äôs hard to breathe and shake those images away and my anxiety is through the roof. I have discomfort with sex, with older men, this manager was twice my age and groomed, manipulated and assaulted me and on top of that my ex who dumped me over it says I gave myself up to a grown ass man, referring to my assault. He says I cheated and from the start of the relationship thought poorly of me because of my past of seeking validation and attention from guys n such but I wasn‚Äôt that person anymore, he couldn‚Äôt see that and then this manager takes advantage of me and he sees me as the worst person ever, that it‚Äôs all my fault. I know I need therapy really bad, this has been really hard to live with the ptsd from my assault, I‚Äôve been in the shower almost passing out from the fear and discomfort of even being naked and seeing myself in the mirror, I hate being touched now by anybody really, especially men. My ex always accused me of being suspicious from the start, going through my phone, making bets with his friend that if I was drunk enough I would sleep with his friend, stalking me at work and always looking into old messages and being hypocritical about opposite sex‚Äôs being friends, he had women he had pasts with added and I couldn‚Äôt, which I respected although having slip ups wanting to catch up with a few of them, there was never cheating. This year has been awful and I really just want this manager out of my head, I hate seeing his face every day, and the anxiety I feel when I see a car that looks like his or a guy that looks somewhat like him, I wish people, especially those much older could just take no for an answer and not force anything, it hurts, so so much mentally and even physically, the nausea and hard time breathing, I just want to feel normal, wish my ex could‚Äôve been more supportive like I was with him but he won‚Äôt ever understand and I know I deserve someone who loves, respects and supports me and doesn‚Äôt hold my past against me, a past I had way before we started dating, and doesn‚Äôt blame me for what a manager twice my age did to me without my consent, considering my ex has been through similar with his brothers girlfriend years back.

1hk1cel,post,Was this attempted rape?,"EDIT 2: I don‚Äôt know why everyone is down voting this post and my comments. I should have just spoken to the police or to rape crisis but I thought in this community id be able to speak to someone with a similar experience. I‚Äôve had a particularly rough day mentally and I‚Äôm not as eloquent or coherent as I usually am tonight. I‚Äôve struggled with dissociation for years and I can‚Äôt respond or communicate as well as I should be able to when I‚Äôm feeling like this. 

EDIT: or attempted assault by penetration? as I explain further down they carry the same sentence in the UK. Just wondering how the police determine attempted rape. I will be able to find out from the police at a later date when I can speak to my SOIT again.

Sorry, I should probably call rape crisis to ask this but I‚Äôm at work and I‚Äôve called them before and talked through it but didn‚Äôt ask this specific question.

If he was unable to penetrate me with his fingers because he couldn‚Äôt get his fingers down *there* because my jeans were too tight and I was lying rigid and not moving, and then after me holding his wrist to try and stop him from forcing his hand down he stopped, was this attempted rape or attempted assault by penetration (different offence but carries same sentencing in UK).

I truly thought I was going to be raped at the time. I saw the definition of attempted rape is if the perpetrator is interrupted or gets stopped which is technically what happened, my jeans and me clutching his wrist deterred him, I was at the time immediately grateful but years on the fear of being about to be subjected to something so intimate still knocks the breath out of me sometimes and I‚Äôm starting to go over the details instead of trying to forget it as I‚Äôve reported it to the police. I didn‚Äôt even realise it was sexual assault at the time let alone possibly attempted rape. I mean I knew on one level in my body and my fear but I justified and minimised it in my head. Sorry they ended up being a rant. 

Feel free to ask questions or share if you had a similar experience I don‚Äôt mind talking about graphic things anymore.",1,11.0,2024-12-22 16:01:26,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hk1cel/was_this_attempted_rape/

1hk1ft1,post,My mom wants me to forgive my stepdad. I do not think I am ready.,"I am a 14 year old female.

So for some background information, when I was 7 my mother met my stepfather. I will call him Franklin. That is not his real name just the one I will be using.

So my mother met Franklin when I was 7 years old. He didn't seem to bad at first (As a lot of abusers don't) However, I think something worth noting here is that while Franklin was already in his mid 60s, my mom was just in her early to mid 20s.

I also heard that he cornered his ex wife. I don't know weather or not he sexually assaulted her or hit her, but my mother tries to claim she lied about that. I personally believe her as given just how horrible this man is it would not surprise me.

Anyway, on how this actually came to be. I was 9 years old when it first started

MASSIVE TW: CHILD MOLSETATION 

.I noticed he would like to play ""tickle games"" but there where two very specific spots that he would touch. My inner thigh and my armpits near my breasts. It made me uncomfortable but at the time I didn't know what he was doing. Maybe it was a accident?

Well at the ages of 10-11 he would show me all kinds of porn  and make me watch porn with him. (Sometimes he specifically would look for stuff like ""older man younger woman"" or ""teen"" or ""Stepdaughter"" he also masterbated in front of me one time, When I was 10 he cornered me and started putting his hands up under my shirt and feeling my breasts. I kept telling him to stop and he wouldn't. When I was 11, he kept trying to grab my gentails and rub and touch them. I would try and pull away shouting ""Stop stop stop"" but he never did. 

  
Finally. when I was 12 I told my mom. At first she said she was disgusted and that she would absolutely leave him. However as time went on, she started to downplay the situation by saying ""Well he didn't rape you so it's not that bad"" And yes while he did'nt rape me, he still molested me. touched me, He tried to bribe me with money to see if id show him my privates, She wants me to forgive him, but I just don't know if I can ",31,15.0,2024-12-22 16:05:37,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hk1ft1/my_mom_wants_me_to_forgive_my_stepdad_i_do_not/
1hk1nwp,post,i'm so disgusted,"i met a guy last night who has been trying to see me for months. before we saw each other it was agreed nothing sexual. but when i saw him, it kept getting sexual. i would push him off and he'd stop for a little and come back. then, he would start fingering me, and i'd try to get up and he would pull me back or not let me move, until i was really harsh in the way i'd push him off or out of me. and when he did stop in this moments he would jump back, not just stop. eventually one time i was laying on his lap, he started fingering me and when i would move him to stop he'd resist, until again i was really forceful. then he turned my head around and started kissing me, i thought that was it, until i heard something and turned around and he was touching himself behind me. i told him to take me home. i don't remember much after that. i think i started to dissociate. the last thing i remember is him saying ""if i made you feel a type of way im sorry.. i guess"". and for him to tell me how i was feeling and i said i don't feel anything. he started speeding up the car. i don't know if i'm overreacting or underreacting. i got in the house and took all my clothes off and put on my late boyfriend's clothes. i feel so gross someone please help me dissect this.",4,4.0,2024-12-22 16:16:47,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hk1nwp/im_so_disgusted/

You should consider how each person from that group might react to the information, you don't need people questioning you or your experiences. If you feel like you should or want to tell someone, start with someone you're sure is trustworthy; and remember you don't owe explanations about your assault to anybody. Anything you do, ask yourself first if it WILL be benefitial to you in any way, otherwise it may lead to twisting the knife inside a wound that you just realised you have.

m3bdd6w,comment,,"I was in an abusive relationship at 16 too and I've experienced some of the things you described that happened to you. In my experience, we broke up and came back together MANY times and everytime it got more and more violent; but I still felt like I wanted to go back to him. From what I've tried to rationalise, I was not only accustomed to the dynamic but also addicted. I knew he was no good but I was still obsessed, which is a clear sign of cognitive dissonance (abuse will do that to you)

I have CPTSD and I think this may be the way our brain tries to take control over the situation: by taking it from the past and dragging it into the present in order to process it better. (Note that I am no therapist and this is purely how I rationalised it, take only whatever resonates with you)

My advice and what worked for me was:
-Firstly, go no contact AT ALL, remove all sight of her (with the exception of proof of abuse if you might report her some day). Don't check socials or pictures and especially not for a long time.

-Keep yourself busy and fill your time with new things. Actively try to meet new people, research new hobbies, etc. or focus on the ones you know. But for a while, you have to keep your mind busy. A healthy routine is also really important.

-Seek therapy if possible and cut straight to the point in sessions. Don't let this be the elephant in the room. If you think you might have PTSD, I'd recommend EMDR specialists because it really does wonders

Also journaling helped me a lot. Whenever I felt like I just had to go back to him, to text him, missed him or whatever, I would write down my feelings and tried to explain where do I think they come from.

m3bgqaf,comment,,"I'm a guy hopefully I can help a little. Just you going out of your way to make friends with a guy will go so far to teach you this. It'd be good (like someone said) to have a therapist you can talk to about this.

I'd say the safest position would be no mentions of or talking about sex especially when it's just you two alone. I'd signal you're uncomfortable if it ever gets brought up. You can just be like ""uuuhhh...okay..."". Guys should be used to this. If he refuses, gtfo. 

Keep in mind predatory people can sniff out victims. Guys have done this to me (Im bi), because of small things most would not notice, like freezing up when guys make sex jokes, not noticing when a dude is being ""gay"" with me until someone else points it out, being aggressive towards the idea of joking flirting and taking it as a threat/disrespect, etc. It only takes a needle in a haystack to latch onto you. 

Just keep in mind because you have these issues, he has a *much* higher chance than most men to be predatory. Keep that in mind. Make sure you've got a guy or a girl with healthy relationships with men to talk to about this. But if you don't start now, you'll have this issue forever. 

So:
No letting him talk or joke about sex. He shouldn't try until he's known you for like a week and you're close. It is abnormal for guys to talk about that stuff with women they don't know quite well. If he tries that's a red flag. 

If you feel he's hitting on you, just say ""you're a good friend"" or smth along those lines. Think you're overly paranoid? Guys are used to it, at least they should be tbh.

Your brain is like a smoke alarm going off all the time. You need to fix it but if there's actual fire you need a second opinion *irl*.

Try and appeal to his interests, not your sexuality. Tell him he's a good friend and a likable person. That stuff.",2,,2024-12-22 18:35:59,t3_1hju8r5,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hju8r5/how_am_i_supposed_to_act_around_men_how_are_men/m3bgqaf/

1hk6azw,post,"I don‚Äôt know how to label what happened, was I sexually assaulted?","This is something that happened almost a decade ago, and I‚Äôm really only now actually trying to come to understand it, for many reasons. Predominately, i‚Äôve realized just how just how much this experience has warped my view regarding sex, and I feel that I should open up to a therapist about this.

When I was around 13, a friend and I were having a sleepover at my house, he was a little older than me, around half a year or so, but he was fairly taller and stronger than me. We were playing outside, when he started making suggestive comments and touching my waist. It wasn‚Äôt uncommon that we would make vulgar jokes or wrestle/roughhouse so I didn‚Äôt think too much of it. 

Around an hour later we went back into my parents house, but they weren‚Äôt home at the time so it was just us two there. 
We went to my room to start hanging out, but he walked in behind me and locked the door. I asked him what he was doing, he made more sexual comments, and began taking off his pants. I was shocked, and I didn‚Äôt really know what to do as I was not a sexual person, and I was worried. He pulled down his pants, exposed his genitals, and started walking towards me. I was scared to try to get around him, as he was between me and the door, and I knew that he was stronger than me. He came really close to me, I told him to stop, but he started rubbing his genitals on me while telling me to bend over. 

Thankfully, thank god, after a few seconds of my silence to the question we both heard the front door and my parents walk into the house and he knew that they could hear me if I yelled out. He put his pants back on, I went out to the kitchen and stood around my parents, they didn‚Äôt notice anything, and I was quiet because I was in shock. I regret not speaking up right there. 

We silently played video games until his mother came to pick him up.

Should I call this sexual assault? Or something else? I don‚Äôt know how to approach my therapist with this, or what to call it. It‚Äôs difficult to process.",6,3.0,2024-12-22 19:57:54,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hk6azw/i_dont_know_how_to_label_what_happened_was_i/

1hk6ku2,post,I don't know if this was sexual assault or just inappropriate touching,"At the time this happened, I was 10, so please don't blame me for what I did. So, I was really attached to my belongings when I was younger, and my older brothers would steal things I had because they knew I was attached. One time, my older brother, who was 13, stole one of my stuffed animals and he said that he would destroy it if I didn't let him touch me. He would say things like 'If you don't let me, you don't care about her(her being the stuffed animal he took)', so I agreed. He made me go into a room with him and take my pants off. I didn't know what he was doing was wrong at the time, but it felt really disgusting. When I did learn about what happened later, I was too scared to tell anyone because he's my biological brother and he was 13, and half a year had already passed since it happened. It was the only time it happened because I got a lock on my door to keep him out, but for another year, he would walk up behind me and slide his fingers between my legs when he thought no one was looking.

1hk6o39,post,My experience as a victim of ‚Äúthe hot older girl‚Äù and how others think I am ‚Äúlucky‚Äù,"
I‚Äôm sharing my story about how I got abused by a 28 year old woman who used her good looks and charm to take advantage of a 16 year old me. I want to raise awareness for those who also have experienced this and make others feel represented. I also want to warn other teens who glamorize sleeping with or dating a grown woman. It is extremely harmful and should not be glamorized.
Last year, when I was 16 (M), I was in a relationship with a 28 (F). She was a regular at the coffee shop where I worked part time. She would always give me flirty looks, and eventually, she gave me her number. The idea of being with a ‚Äúhot‚Äù older woman felt like such a huge achievement in my mind.
At first, she was like the woman of my dreams. She was funny and outgoing, and I fell in love within a month of knowing her. As time went on, though, she became emotionally abusive, but she knew exactly how to manipulate me. Nobody knew about the relationship because I was terrified my parents would find out and kill me. So, everything was kept a secret.
She told me that if I wanted to be with her, I had to fulfill her s*xual needs. Being a horny, teenage boy, I was excited. Since I was a v*rg*n before I met her, she became my first s*xual partner. Knowing that, she would get mad at me for not being as good in bed as her exes who were grown adults. She would shame me and by doing that I felt forced to do things I wasn‚Äôt comfortable with just to make her happy. She also expected me to buy her things she knew I couldn‚Äôt afford to use that as a tactic to make me feel bad for her. She would threaten leaving me all alone to get her way and I obeyed. She manipulated me into giving her my entire paycheck every week. I was literally working for her.
She always told me that I was lucky to be with her. And how if i don‚Äôt appreciate it more then she will go to one of the other men who want her. I feel so stupid now for falling for all of it. When I would hang out with my friends or study for classes, she would cry and say things like, ‚ÄúI shouldn‚Äôt have given you a chance. I know you‚Äôre young but I thought you were mature. You‚Äôre clearly not serious about me.‚Äù Because of that, I ended up isolating myself from my friends and my studies, thinking I needed her to be happy‚Äîwhen, in reality, I was just being used.
When I found out she was ‚Äúcheating‚Äù on me with multiple guys, I tried to end the relationship. But she threatened to leak every picture and text that I sent to her. She somehow flipped it in a way where it was my fault for not doing enough in the relationship. She said I had to earn her love back. To prove myself to her, I quit my job at the coffee shop so I could prove that I was solely committed to her and would not let anything get between us. 
The next day I texted and called her like usual but got no response. This happened for an entire week straight. When she finally replied, she said, ‚ÄúStop calling me, why would you quit your job. You got rid of the only thing I kept you around for. I only had fun for a few weeks in the beginning.‚Äù In my mind we had been ‚Äúdating‚Äù for 6 months at that point. And that was the last thing I ever heard from her. The feelings that I felt towards her were not love. I was attached to her because she used her power over me to make me feel like I couldn‚Äôt be without her. And that constant approval that I wanted from her was rooted in her using predatory tactics to make me rely on her. It was not a relationship but rather I was a victim and she was a predator. 
The ‚Äúbreakup‚Äù sent me into a depression that took a lot of time and therapy to heal. When I told someone who I thought was my friend about it, I was laughed at because ‚ÄúI was so lucky to be with the hot and mature woman. And that a teenage guy can‚Äôt be sexually exploited and abused‚Äù.
 So many high school boys glamorize the idea of being with older women because it feels like an accomplishment or something to brag about. But that mindset is so dangerous. 
A predator is a predator, no matter the gender or how attractive they may be. 

If you are in a similar situation just know you are not alone and what you experienced is wrong and is not ‚Äúlesser‚Äù than other abuse because you are a guy.

I didn‚Äôt even realise what he did was sexual assault for literally years and years after, so what the police and the courts define as various types of sexual assault does matter to me because it helps me understand what happened to me.

I know he was trying to have sex with me and I‚Äôm wondering as rape and assault by penetration carry the same sentence, why there is an ‚Äúattempt‚Äù sentence for one and not for the other. I still think this is a reasonable question. 

Trying to figure out the definitions of things by law or how the law treats SA victims and how up to date it is, is important. Years ago it wasn‚Äôt legally considered rape if you were married.

I‚Äôm going over to their house on tuesday for a Xmas party and what pains me is that i feel guilty, i haven‚Äôt seen my aunt and cousins in 4/5 years and i am now going to see them again, i feel guilty for thinking about this.

On the difference of definition, or why one has an attempt charge and the other doesn't, our legal system is flawed. That's ultimately the answer, which is why I said it's for the police to determine. I'm sorry if you thought I was being abrasive, I used to work for the courts and am used to talking about it in a barebones sense.

The excuse of ‚Äúyou orgasmed‚Äù or ‚Äúyou got wet‚Äù or, in the case of men being assaulted ‚Äúyou got hard‚Äù is a common way sexual abusers attempt to manipulate their victims into not reporting, but it carries no factual basis. 

Orgasming is, in a lot of cases, primarily because of the physical feeling of nerve endings being stimulated and not because of actual enjoyment.

fast forward to last year at christmas, i put a boundary in place that i will no longer be at family get togethers if he is present. this did not sit well with literally anyone in my family, so they decided that having an ‚Äúintervention‚Äù between me and my rapist would solve all our problems and that i would magically forgive him and change my mind. i ended up agreeing to this intervention just so i could confront him and ask him why he did what he did to me. during this, his mother was present and heard him admit that i never lied about anything he did to me, and i felt extremely satisfied. when i asked him why he raped/molested me for years, he said he had the most access to me and he was also being assaulted. i left that intervention feeling better having confronted him, but i still held firm that i would not be near him any longer, because i cannot separate him with the memories and trauma he caused me, making old feelings resurface.

Orgasm does happen when you enjoy sex, but there is also a physical component to it. Both men and women can achieve an orgasm if their genitalia gets physically stimulated the right way, even if they ABSOLUTELY did not want it or enjoy it! In fact it often makes victims feel worse.

1hka3iu,post,how SA ruins intimacy.,"i was raped almost 2 years ago by a boyfriend at the time. it was my first time, but it wasn‚Äôt consented. after we broke up, i eventually got with another boy. he eventually did the same thing to me months into our relationship and it took me months to accept what was happening.
i now have another boyfriend. i‚Äôve quickly realized how badly messed up being SAd ruins intimacy. i find it hard to do things with him without thinking of being SAd. when we do things that are more sexual, i‚Äôm scared of having an episode. i find no one really talks about this. in a way, i fear SA made me hyper sexual and i feel guilty afterwards. i feel as if i owe him something, even though i know i don‚Äôt. he has never done anything that makes me feel like i do and i feel safe knowing i can tell him to stop at any time and he will. but i don‚Äôt know how to fix this. even thinking about sex makes me think about SA at times. i‚Äôm scared of intimacy somedays, but i find comfort in it other days. no one i speak to understands, even if they say they do. i just want someone to tell me they understand and mean it, i think?
i feel like i know the ins and outs of SA and being a victim, but i know theres so many things i know nothing about when it comes to this. i hope to have closure and learn. it‚Äôs weird to know i‚Äôve been a victim for so long and still be confused on what exactly happened and what is happening now.",13,5.0,2024-12-22 23:00:32,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hka3iu/how_sa_ruins_intimacy/

1hkaztj,post,I think I was SA‚ÄôD by my Dad,"*TW*

I was either 18, 19, 20. I think in college already. Im 27 now. Recently I‚Äôve been remembering this night a lot. I keep seeing images and I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm making it up. This is very embarrassing but one night I think I ‚Äúfinished‚Äù in my sleep and felt someone touching me (maybe it was myself or someone else in a dream or real life) Now, I have experienced sleep paralysis and have nightmares when sleeping on my back. I was on my back in this case. I woke up very drowsy looked around, and could have sworn I saw my dad walking out my room and looking back to check on me and closing the door. I thought I was dreaming and I was incredibly disturbed. I brushed it off and went back to sleep in my ‚Äúdream‚Äù. I remember waking up and feeling very disturbed and anxious, but brushed it off and decided to forget about it. It‚Äôs until recently my brain decided to think back on this day. I‚Äôve been really freaking out. I‚Äôll also add when he was a bit drunk, he slapped my ass ONCE in front of my mom. I was super uncomfortable but brushed it off cause maybe he wasn‚Äôt thinking and was just being playful. I was about 19 I think. I‚Äôll also mention, he was an alcoholic then. Drank every single night. I know people have had nightmares and doing sexual things with their parents, and I‚Äôve always brushed it off as that.  What are some signs to look in a person that says this could have happened to me? He‚Äôs never physical abused me, slapped, etc etc. I knew my parents loved me. They showed that. My dad got almost everything I wanted. He worried about me, was very protective, and strict with me but not to a point where it was possessive. He supported me financially when i transferred to another college and paid for my rent. Very emotional when I left like any dad would but didn‚Äôt force me to stay home. Is it possible I was abused? Any signs I should be looking for?",3,1.0,2024-12-22 23:47:00,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hkaztj/i_think_i_was_sad_by_my_dad/

I told him it was fine that I forgive him but he said it was his fault either way because he made the mistake and also made me scared to speak up before. 


Something similar happened before in May where I handed him a condom and he got upset and just went in without one anyways.

In our swimming location, there was a small park in which me and her would play at. And sometimes, her brother ( he was a little bit older than me) would join us. And the amount of times they would talk about or point out my boobs was weird. As a child, I felt embarrassed by them because they were more developed than other girls my age. And I was a shy girl, so I just stood there and let them talk about my boobs. Another time, we had a playdate at my house. We were playing dress-up with the vast amount of dresses that I have. And, she REFUSED to let me change in my closet. She demanded that I change in front of her, regardless of how much I protested. So I did, and the entire time, she was fixated on my chest. She made me change several times, while she wore the same dress. So, now, years later as a teenager, I need an answer if this was abuse or not. I feel weird because I genuinely don't know if I'm overreacting about the entire situation, or if it's really not that big of a deal. I'm no longer in contact with this girl, and I haven't been for years because she moved away, but idk??? It only happened a few times, and we were pretty good friends, so I'm probably just going crazy. I don't think it's that bad considering we were young, but the entire thing has always made me uncomfortable. So idkkk..Her brother would also say a bunch of things about my chest size, but we mostly never talked to each other, so ü§∑. And if this entire post is just junk, I'm sorry for posting it on here. All of you guys are so brave and amazing. ",2,2.0,2024-12-23 01:25:45,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hkcvqq/is_this_considered_sa/

1hkdf2p,post,Realization of Sexual Assault Months Later,"I wanted to put my story out there for those, who like me, have been sexually assaulted but only realized it much later.

This past summer, I met a guy on a dating app. 
Things were great at first. I told him about a party I was going to and he asked if I wanted to come over to his place afterwards. I thought about it and said yes. I told him I was a virgin and that I didn‚Äôt want to do anything sexually and he was aware. We haven‚Äôt known each other for long but a part of me felt safe enough with him that I didn‚Äôt think he would hurt me maliciously just based on his actions prior. 
Man was I wrong‚Ä¶
At the party, I got drunk (not intentionally, I tried to stop once I reached my limit but it was too late). 
My friends tried to help me sober up. I called him multiple times and my friend spoke to him on the phone to let him know i was intoxicated and needed to sober up before going to his place. soon after i arrived at his place, still very much not sober, that was when the assault took place. my virginity was taken from me that night. the next day i was pretty hungover and didn‚Äôt recall much until 2 months later when things ended. 

unfortunately, i trauma bonded to him and was caught in an emotionally and sexually abusive relationship. 
even though the signs were there, he was controlling and manipulative so it was hard to see clarity right away. 
i deleted everything including the call logs, text messages and photos because i was so angry and ashamed and wanted to remove anything that would‚Äôve reminded me of him. he changed his number and so did i. fast forward to present time, im not sure legally i could do anything since i have little evidence at this point. i‚Äôm not sure if it makes sense to press charges or to just let it be but in case nothing comes out of it i want people to at least know if they‚Äôve been through something similar to this, you‚Äôre not alone <",2,4.0,2024-12-23 01:55:40,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hkdf2p/realization_of_sexual_assault_months_later/

1hkdyk5,post,"I think I was raped but I‚Äôm really not sure, please help me understand ","Hi Reddit, this is my first and hopefully only post here. I never use Reddit but I don‚Äôt have anyone to talk to about this so I thought I‚Äôd shoot my shot here. 

I (20f) met a guy almost a year ago. We became friends through our shared hobby, larp. Because of this we would only see each other 4? maybe 5 times. The fourth/fith time being the last one this past September. Already on our third (might have been fourth ig) time seeing each other in July, there was a distinct sexual tension coming from him. A few things to point out are he is 29m and married, separated as of November. 

Nothing happened in July, but the tension escalated in September and we ended up sleeping together. I know I had a lot to drink on the first night we slept together, Thursday to Friday, and was probably drunk. He is a big guy and was definitely not as intoxicated as I was. He was also always buying me my drinks, this is something he had done all the time and every time we had met, so I thought it was just friendly but now I‚Äôm not sure, as I was way way drunk in July when he first tried to start something. 
Despite my intoxication I definitely was consenting and enthusiastic about the make-out sesh we had. (As a precursor, I did know he was married, I am incredibly disgusted in myself that I enabled him to cheat on his wife and I wish I could take it back every day.)

Might be tmi but‚Ä¶ One thing led to another and he was eating me out in his car. I was onboard with this. There was copious amounts of eating out and fingering in my vagina. When it came to the actual penetrative sex he then put his penis in my anus. Dry. At first I didn‚Äôt quite register what was happening, but it started to hurt and I think I remember saying ‚Äúwait‚Äù but I also think I might have whispered it. It is my belief that the sounds I was making were definitely different to the ones of enjoyment I had just made before, but I might be wrong. I also don‚Äôt know if it might have just been an accident on his part‚Ä¶

What I definitely remember is waiting desperately for it to be over and not enjoying it. Had he asked me if it would be okay to do anal I would have said no. 

I was also scared I had imagined the whole thing but I remember, and it‚Äôs in my search history, googling for information about anal sex as I was bleeding anally for a few days. So I know it happened. 

The other thing that muddies the water is that on Saturday to Sunday that same week I slept with him again, and that was all okay. It was enjoyable and I consented. There was only a small moment when we were rearranging ourselves that he tried to go from my vagina to my anus, I said, in a not very jokey tone, wrong one, he then kinda laughed it off and everything was okay. At the time the laugh felt okay, like it was a relaxed mood, but the more I think on it the more it makes me uneasy. 
We had then been chatting a video calling up until a few weeks ago because I only end of November came to the realisation that it might not have been as consensual as I thought it was. 

There is more I could say about uncomfortable moments in our calls and texts, but I mainly need help making heads or tails of that one night. 
There was one friend I told who said it‚Äôs rape. I can‚Äôt talk to here anymore though so I really need help. 

Sorry it‚Äôs such a long one.

m3dw5wh,comment,,"I‚Äôm so sorry OP. Unfortunately I think this is pretty common. Our brain automatically dissociates from the trauma when it happens, and if we don‚Äôt put the story together, we can continue our denial.

I was in denial for 18 years. I saw him this summer and was physically near him. I felt SO uncomfortable and couldn‚Äôt understand why. I had never labeled what happened as sexual assault/rape, and so I had no conscious memory to tie to the feeling. I just knew I felt compelled to get away from him. For the next several months I kept trying to push memories and thoughts of him away, but they just kept coming. I finally got into the bad memory and still it took months to unfold. I went through rape trauma syndrome and still have PTSD. It ruined my life and could have taken my marriage from me had my husband not doubled down instead of giving up. I was numb to all emotion and had told him I wasn‚Äôt sure I wanted to be married anymore, making no connection to my intrusive thoughts. Thank goodness I got to the memory when I did or else it very well may have ended us.

1hkf6o8,post,"Please, read this and asnwer with something. I need to know the opinion of somebody else. This is my story. Was this Sexual Harrasment and SA?","**Ok. This is kinda hard to write tbh.** Sorry for any mispelling or grammar mistake, english is not my native language. 

So, this is the story of how i ended up being (i think) sexually harassed and then (completely sure) sexually assaulted. ***It all happened a year ago, when i was 12. Im gonna be B.***

***It all started with a girl in my friend group. Lets name her E*** (12f)***.***

E was in love with this guy, lets name him J (16m) So blablabla stuff im not gonna mention, and boom they got together. He started to join us in lunch break and sometimes in recess. And then, he started doing flirting jokes and stuff with me. Im gonna summarize it the best i can.   
  
He used to blow kisses at me, say jokes about me, flirt ""jokingly"" with me, he once LITERALLY said he loved me (he like told it to the whole group like ""i love B guys u know that right"") And we all stayed quiet, He never ""joked"" that hard again or said it like that, bu he got physical and touchy.   
  
First, after school i was walking home, He crossed the street and caught up with me and put his arm around my shoulder. He asked where i was going, i said i was going home, he replied with ""lets go there"" i asked where and he said ""to your house"" i stayed quiet. Then, when we stood next to an empty local which was dark and EMPTY with a big ass garage door. Then, he pushed me into the building with the mass of his body (he like redirected our direction into the building, fast and STRONG). I stood away from him and got out as i said ""Oh nononno let go of me"". 

Other times he blowed kisses at me, SLAPPED MY ASS, pulled my arms, like one time i was in the schools entrance and he grabbed me by my arm and pulled me out of the school (the bell rang to go home) i told him to let me go but he didnt until i moved my arm hard and then he let go, he left my arm red. Like RED. 

And this time i went into the school bathroom, he entered behind me and closed the door. The light was off. He started to get close to me and ask me to give him a ""little kiss"" i told him no and to stop but he kept asking and walk behind me when i got away from him. I said ""why do u have to bother so much"" as i covered my face, then he opened the door and left the bathroom.

And the last thing i can remember before the assault was that he gave me a sudden hug from behind like a freaking bear in a convenience store next to the school where i was buying snacks and stuff. I told him to let me go but he didnt until like the sixth time. Later that day i messaged him to not touch me because the perfume he used gave me nausea and it stuck to my body and clothes that time when he hugged me like that. I didnt really like that. Everytime he was around me i always got nervous and feel a lot of butterflys in my stomach, but not pleasant love ones. The ones that appear when youre scared of what somebody could do, say or come up with out of nowhere.

***I have to say, i always rejected the stuff he did. I DID. I told him to not do that kind of stuff and he kept doing it.*** 

***Now, to the thing that made me stop treating him the same and talk with him the same. The SA.***

It was december 1st, 2023, 22 days before my birthday, at the school's stairs. The bell rang to go home, i left my classroom and made my way to the stairs. I was going down the stairs when i felt a subtle grab on my butt, i thought it was an accident since there was a lot of people and we were kinda tight, then i felt how somebody grope my butt. He groped my butt, he grabbed my butt and squeezed it hard while he put his fingers between my legs, almost touching my testicles. I never gave him permission to touch me like that, nor did he ask for consent. He just did it. As a ""JOKE"". And he's fucking ""straight"" along his friends? I hate that guy. 

When it happened i didnt turn back, and when i asked him he denied it, but there was just boys of his grade (11th) behind me. And he was the only one who could have touched me that way, Not just that, but he used to tell his girlfriend (E) my friend about all the things he did but not with all the details, and she found it fucking funny. (J) That dumb fuck told her that he was the one that grabbed my ass, and this other friend of mine was there and told me. Not just that, but another time after that he groped my butt again in school but in a way more subtle way. 

The other day like a month ago i was walking through the halls and he said my name as he was smilling at me, he was in a group of friends. I just eyesided him with an angry face and kept walking. I felt bad, and now, while im writting this, i feel kinda bad. But then i remember how he treated me even after i put boundaries and i stop feeling bad. 

***Im 13, im going to be 14 in 24 minutes.*** 

***He was 16, i was 12.***",1,4.0,2024-12-23 03:37:50,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hkf6o8/please_read_this_and_asnwer_with_something_i_need/

1hkfm9b,post,If someone even wanted to have sex with me I'd cry ,"The thought of having to be intimate with someone again after what happened is scary. I don't want to be vulnerable with people, it's gross. It's not even the act that grosses me out it's that I have to be vulnerable. Like, I HAVE TO BE NAKED FOR THIS??? And I have to let someone be ANYWHERE close to my genitals?? NOKOOMSHSN

It's cool to think about as a fantasy, but that's a controlled environment without the danger of being assaulted. Like, it's better to have a fantasy with some cute person than to have to actually be vulnerable with anyone, it makes me feel so much better because it's SAFE. It scares me to think about one day someone will maybe want to do that with me. Intimacy is terrifying, I don't want to get hurt again.

I would be fine with sex if there was an 100% chance of it being safe, but it's never like that, so I don't think I'll ever stop fearing intimacy.",9,1.0,2024-12-23 04:03:24,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hkfm9b/if_someone_even_wanted_to_have_sex_with_me_id_cry/

Noone noticed or can tell if someone is from privilaged background or not at first. but somehow it always seems that low income class peopel always ended up getting hurt and victim of sexual abuse more than rich people. I see so many rich women sexualizing themselves and being comfortable in their sexuality and not afraid to express their sexual desire openly without getting harassed or fear of getting abused by others. I dont understand how upper class people never seem to experience any negative encounter with sex but large amount of SA victims seem to come from under-privileged family, whether it's about financial or emotional support. im trying to figure out what the common denominator that contributes to this difference in experience, so I can identify the pattern and have better understanding of human psychology. is it a certain vibe that wealthy/confident people give off?

m3e7ob1,comment,,If you handed him a condom in May and he put in without anyway that is rape.

I‚Äôm confused about him saying he ‚Äúcan‚Äôt do this‚Äù what is this? wear a condom? Deal with you not moving and be emotional?

It‚Äôs a way to trick your mind that it wasn‚Äôt that bad and wasn‚Äôt rape.

m3ea1m9,comment,,"Getting wet, or having an orgasm, is very much a PHYSIOLOGICAL reaction. In case you don‚Äôt know, this means that your body, involuntarily, responds to physical stimuli in the environment. Just as you cannot help but shiver when it‚Äôs cold, you cannot help if your body responds to stimulation (consensual or not) of your genital area. So, yes absolutely, it is still a rape if you experienced orgasm. 

It‚Äôs also important to understand that, especially for women, these physiological experiences can often occur as a response to the stress of the interaction. Getting wet during forcible penetration is your body‚Äôs attempt at protecting that area from lacerations and other injuries that might otherwise be worse without. In incredibly blunt words, getting wet during a rape is your body‚Äôs way of lessening possible tears or scrapes caused by the penetration. 

Please, please remember that consent needs to be given verbally and behaviorally, and if you said ‚Äúno‚Äù at any time, that needs to be respected. No physiological bodily response can diminish the reality that this was an assault.

1hkgv24,post,Is it sexual assault if someone lies about not being about to cum inside you? ,"Sorry, typo in the title, it is meant to be able! 

I might be overreacting since it isn't that big of a deal but I'm honestly just freaking out. 

I used to date this girl, I was always uncomfortable with sex because it just seemed that way to me (sweaty, pregnancy risks, etc.) but she eased me into it by randomly grabbing my hand and making me touch her boobs and hold them which she never asked or even told me she was planning to get me used to sexual things

We had sex a bit later, she told me because she was on this type of HRT she couldn't ejaculate any sperm because she was an expert in that stuff and I believed she wouldn't lie to me I was fine with having it unprotected (we were both virgins so I wasn't worried about STDs)

I probably should have taken a step back and question if she was lying about it because I felt sick one day and I told her I needed to tell her something but not over text so she thought I got pregnant. Once I told her why I wanted to talk to her she did make jokes about leaving me if I was which is honestly partly why I am back and forth on it

I know in situations like that, it is to baby trap. It is possible it could be like that as she weirdly switched up on wanting kids in the future when I said I couldn't handle them but we are both teenagers so it doesn't seem to be the case. Another reason I thought is that it was because we did not have money for condoms and she just lied so she wouldn't have to wait. 

I just don't know anymore, I know google says yes but it is possible she was just stupid and didn't know. Besides, I did consent to the sex and I didnt exactly tell her to stop with the groping bit",2,6.0,2024-12-23 05:20:39,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hkgv24/is_it_sexual_assault_if_someone_lies_about_not/

I know for a fact I was groomed when I was 11-12 and I definitely have sexual trauma from that. But I remember having symptoms of sexual trauma before that happened when I was even younger.

I don't really want to go into a ton of details but if anyone asks for them I will provide some more, but I've written down a whole list of symptoms I had. A few are, when I was like 5 I looked up stuff about porn, I've had nightmares, and when I was a little kid I was scared about being raped.",3,3.0,2024-12-23 05:26:48,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hkgyde/i_think_i_was_sexually_abused_when_i_was_a_kid/

I've had these thoughts before but I kept ignoring them when they arrived. When I was younger I had the kid phase of not wanting to take a bath. When my mom wouldn't hear me in the shower she'd come in and check on me. Sometimes I was in the shower already sometimes I wasn't. Either way I was naked. Eventually, sometimes she'd come in and aggresively start giving me a bath and I would be crying, shaking, and telling her to stop. I told her once that I think she might have molested me and she started crying so I apologized and didn't mention or think about it again. Some thinks to know: I'm a girl. I was around 9-10. I don't think she did a bad thing but my mind won't get rid of the thoughts. I can't ask anyone that I actually know, and I can't tell a guidance counselor because I'm adopted and might be put into the system.",0,2.0,2024-12-23 05:43:00,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hkh76a/does_this_count_as_sa/

I have one very specific memory of being in 4th grade and going hunting with my uncle and I remember being excited about something happening between us which is so disgusting, but before we went he took me to practice shooting alone and he grabbed one of my breasts I was happy he did at first but then realized it was wrong and I tried to push it in the back of my mind like he was just trying to help me reposition the gun. Sometimes I‚Äôve thought to myself maybe I‚Äôm remembering this wrong, maybe it wasn‚Äôt real or I‚Äôm trying to cause trouble thinking that this happened. Even before this event I had seen my uncle in a sexual manner. I would think about him and touch myself when I was in elementary school. As I got Into my early teen years I was confused as to why I was attracted to him but being around him made me extremely uncomfortable. I was also very hypersexual to the point I was acting out a lot and making horrible choices. Now that I‚Äôm an adult he almost completely avoids any conversation with me at family gatherings or dinners but will always hug me goodbye and kiss the side of my face.

1. I‚Äôve always stated prior during conversations with him, many times, that I‚Äôve never wanted to oral under any circumstances and it has never been in my interest of doing so. During one night I had agreed to doing a handjob‚Äîlike I always have, during so he then asked me to put my mouth on it which I said no to, and he kept begging me to which I eventually gave into and did it only for a little while, stopped, and was still asked to do it again, ignoring it that time. 

2. In this other instance which I am more confused on, him and I were both play fighting and he then said how he wondered what it would feel like if I ‚Äòsat on his face‚Äô in this moment I was clothed and so was he, he asked me to do so and I said no and kept attempting to back away while we were play fighting and he kept trying to make me do so which I still did not agree with, eventually he somehow maneuvered me on top of him and I was then stuck in a weird position on top of him for a little while, and in this position I couldn‚Äôt move off until I figured it out or he let go enough.

1hkj88u,post,Why do I feel deeply uncomfortable with any intimacy even years after being SAd,"I (20f) have been SAd multiple times in my life and been to therapy for it. About 4 months ago I got out of a 9 month generally healthy relationship. I‚Äôve recently started dating again and had a fling with this one guy who opened up about having many bodies. I gave him the benefit of the doubt but after having sex with him a few times it became clear that was the only thing he was interested in. Ever since then I feel this immense fear of being violated. I wasn‚Äôt even SAd by this guy, things just weren‚Äôt super emotionally connecting or enjoyable. I‚Äôm now involved with someone new that I am very excited about but kissing or him touching my butt or boobs makes me extremely anxious. I think he‚Äôs very attractive but am physically anxious and waiting for kissing to be over as soon as it‚Äôs initiated. How do I go about remedying this? I feel such the same way I did after being SAd but it has been years and I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôve had anything non consensual happen. I don‚Äôt feel like this case is as simple as me not liking this because I really do. I‚Äôm just so unbelievably anxious.

1hkk0rf,post,I cant tell if i was sexually assaulted when i was younger.,"Hello, this is my first time posting on reddit. ive always wondered, was i sexually assaulted? I genuinely , when i was younger my answer wouldve been yes but now as an 18 year old my memory is hazy on the subject. This is what i remember, i was young at the oldest i was maybe 7? but i feel like i was maybe around 5 years old i wont get too explicit but i was alone in a room with an older male family member,  i was wearing pink shorts which is something i know for a fact,  this detail has never changed, he was on top of me and he had removed my underwear he said if i complied i would get rewarded, i was so deeply afraid, luckily nothing more happened at least from what i remember. My issue is i dont know if i was dreaming or not i remmeber it enough but not vividly, sometimes it feels like it never happend since the memory now isnt very clear to me. I told my mom about this occurrence a few years ago but i bascially lied about most of what happned in fear that it was a dream and i was accusing somebody who was innocent. Since then ive been wary of this family member and avoid being near him whenever i can, this uncertainity claws at me i fall into depression and it floats around my head i have been in a similar situation with another male family member as well but for some reason it doesnt hurt me as much as this one. I would apperciate any insight any of you might have. Whenever i think of sex its never something i imagine myself doing, i dont think ill ever feel comfortable in my body i have self harmed and still do this is a part of the reason i do but not the only thing. I wish i could speak to a therapist about my past i have had one before but when asked if i have ever been sexually abused or taken advantage of i always just lie.

1hkk2b6,post,Changing what I want is hard,"Hey so wildly terrifying to post. But long story short I was groomed for a good chunk of highschool. There‚Äôs a lot of ways that it hit me but the one getting me right now is what I was groomed to do. I was groomed by someone that would have multiple partners at once. I was groomed to be a part of that. I then proceeded to have relationship a with multiple people that would assault me.

I‚Äôm now in a new monogamous relationship. I‚Äôm with someone who was also assaulted, and we both ended up on the hypersexual due to the trauma. The entire time I was groomed though I was being told this was preparing me for all the women I‚Äôd be sleeping with. This relationship means I‚Äôm not doing that at the first point in my life where sexual freedom is a real possibility. 

It‚Äôs just really weird, because there‚Äôs this piece of me yelling about how this is what I was ‚Äútrained to do‚Äù, and I‚Äôd love for it to shut up. I‚Äôm already in therapy and I‚Äôm going to talk about that soon, but has anyone else had this problem. Where part of you is still trying to follow the instructions that were inserted into you by someone else well after the fact? I‚Äôm never going to betray my partner like that, but I‚Äôd just really love it if the claws this woman sunk into me back in highschool could all just let go. 

I feel horrible that I even have these thoughts and feelings, and I just want to build a life with someone who understands what I‚Äôve been through and be happy. But this voice yells at me when I‚Äôm having sex, when I‚Äôm thinking about sex. It‚Äôs to the point where in the middle of intercourse I just think ‚Äúthis is what she trained you for‚Äù when doing certain things. How do you differentiate what you want from what they wanted for you?",0,3.0,2024-12-23 09:16:07,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hkk2b6/changing_what_i_want_is_hard/

1hkk72f,post,Was it assault?,"So basically while I was with my ex I discovered that I may be somewhere on the spectrum of being asexual. I didn't tell him this for a little while, but over time I started not wanting to have sex with him as often and got to a point where I didn't want to at all and I even stopped making out with him. That's not really the issue here the issue was that whenever I would initiate a kiss with him he would try to make out with me or take things further and like if he tried to kiss me more I would just physically move away (because I've never been a very vocal person in those kinds of situations) and majority of the time he would just move with me so I couldn't get that space between us, or if I said I didn't want to he would ask me if I was sure and say please and stuff like that. I've heard a bunch that coercion still counts as sexual assault but I feel like it doesn't actually count because I never actually said no to any of the things we did and if I did blatantly say no we wouldn't do anything. But like it got to a point where later in our relationship before breaking up he would tell me that he was annoyed we hadn't had sex in a while and I felt like guilty that I wouldn't do anything for him so I would just start doing the things he wanted because I didn't want him to feel bad. I feel like I'm making everything into a bigger deal than it actually was but my friends keep telling me how shitty he was to me and this is just a little cherry on top.

1. He didn't ask for consent, meaning he didn't give you the opportunity to say no. Meaning that even if he HAD pulled out after you said no, it was assault from the word go b/c he never asked. That's not something you can surprise on people. 

2. Doesn't matter if your 'wait' was small. I think it was probably pretty obvious that you were in pain. He should have stopped and asked you if you were ok. 

  
Your response to sleep with him again actually doesn't muddy the waters consent wise at all - your response is actually really normal and common. My best friend remained in a relationship with her rapist for two years: another of my friends did exactly what you did (slept with him again). It's a trauma response - your brain is trying to say, 'if I sleep with this person again, it means that everything is fine and normal, which means that they didn't do anything bad, which means that I'm not traumatised and can live a normal life'.

TW for possible CSA

These memories popped up out of nowhere, and I feel quite numb about them in all honesty. They're very hazy, and I don't know if they're real or if I'm making it up.

I remember several instances as a child where my mum would need to clean my genitals for whatever reason. I remember she would stick her fingers inside my vagina and it would burn horribly. I don't remember ever feeling scared while this was happening, but it doesn't feel right.

I was very hypersexual as a child, and I had no idea why up until now. I had a feeling that something could have happened to me that I couldn't remember, to make me behave in such a way at such a young age. If this actually did happen, that would explain a lot. I can't remember how old I was when these instances with my mother or the hypersexual behaviours started, or what came first. 

I just feel confused, and I don't know what to do.

Edit: Thought I would add that since remembering things, the thought of anything sexual makes me feel repulsed and a bit scared. ",2,4.0,2024-12-23 10:44:11,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hkl7iy/repressed_memories_coming_back/

Also, you‚Äôre right‚Äî no one talks about the torture that is trying to navigate having sex after abuse. I wish more people talked about it because I felt so alone and broken when it first started coming up.

 I had a similar experience to you as a young teen and by the time I was 18/19 the abuse I endured was bubbling to the surface and ruining intimacy with consensual safe partners for me.

The guy would be arrested and no woman would be saying this for the guy? 

Time and place and lack of empathy. What u did was put yourself in his wife shoes cause she's a woman but not put yourself in his shoes. 

He should divorce his wife. She shouldn't have married someone with sexual truama if she couldn't control her sexual urges. What do u think sexual truama ups and vanishes ? And this person is slowly gonna become a sex machine? 

No she made a stupid decision. It's up to an individual to control their sexual desire not blame their partners. Do u know how many men don't get sex from their wives who have low libido ? 

If u open these flood gates. Then if woman start negotiating when men should amd shouldn't have sex and need to fill those needs or they leave. To u think the opposite sex won't? Men have a higher sex drive by 5:1 in their first 40 years. If u make it a partners liability to take care of their partners sex. 

Let's just say when it becomes more acceptable men are gonna start divorcing at rapid rates. The more we get to equality and the more socially equal men get. The more they are gonna divorce and leave relationships. It's a double edged sword.

m3fexmc,comment,,When you have the opportunity I would highly recommend working with someone who does hypnosis specifically hypnosis that allows you to remember memories of the past in a way that will not traumatize this to recall.  One method that is often used for example is to during a hypnotic session you can recall memories by seeing them as if they are happening to someone else on a TV or a movie screen and with a great deal of reinforcement of the idea that when you're awake you will remember these past memories with that same level of detachment as a way to minimize any emotional upset as you are re calling these things more fully,1,,2024-12-23 12:27:22,t1_m3feogx,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hkj8x4/question/m3fexmc/

1hkpbgk,post,Toxic relationships and realizing she sexually assaulted me multiple times,"I made a post, questioning if something was sexual assault. That post plus me questioning it and asking myself if it happened to someone else would it be sa (I tend to downplay things that happen to me) made me realize that holy shit, so many things happened. 

When we started the relationship I was very anxious on touching because I'm not used to affection without overthinking it and then getting overwhelmed. So when our first kiss came around she wanted me to initiate it, while we are cuddling she asked about it and I just froze up. I immediately got incredibly overwhelmed and began to cry when she would bug me over and over again. I actually gave her a verbal no a few times but it got annoyed and decided to kiss me, even after I told her I didn't want to kiss her anymore. 

Due to the whole affection issue I was uncomfortable with sex, I am asexual and fairly repulsed by sex but I was open to it down the road but not after the relationship started. She took it upon herself to try and fix it by randomly grabbing me and forcing me to touch her boobs and play with them without asking if I wanted to try and ease me into sexual things or even giving me a heads up.

Actual sex wasn't the best, it WAS consental at the time as I believed her when she said she was unable to get me pregnant, but recently I found out that it is still pretty likely that you can still get someone pregnant on that medication and I know she knows because she used to talk to me about the side effects, the estimation on when certain things happen and even things to improve them so I don't think she would have missed that part or just was plan stupid (however I will admit I was a bit dumb on my part for blindly believing her.) 

Was there a bunch of warning signs? Yes tons, hell I should have questioned it when she seemed pissed off I wouldn't have sex with her or the one time I did try to pull my hand away from her tit she smirked and put it right back. 

Honestly, if I realized this while we were dating im not even sure if I would have broken it off. She did have a lot of control over me to the point that when I dumped her, she ran a huge hate campaign against me and I lost pretty much all of my irl friends. She even tried to threaten me, saying she was gonna kill herself if I left which it was well textbook abusive behaviour. 

It just sucks, I spent all that time trying to help her with her mental health and her drinking problem just to realize how much she genuinely fucked with my head now. The worst part is that I doubt I would have began to question any of it until my mom brought up to a nurse that my SPD is causing me to be noticeably uncomfortable when people are touching or around me. I know part of that is true but I had a gut feeling there was something else there. 

On the brightside, I'm going to see if I can get an appointment with a counselor to try and figure it all out. I'm not going back into therapy, I finished it so I feel I am adjusted enough to safely cope but I wanted to get just one appointment with a counselor as I think it might be good to just tell someone. I don't think legal wise I can do anything, the most I got is me trying to tell her about the first kiss making me uncomfortable and her bragging about how she didn't need condoms and telling me to stop worrying about it. Not enough for the law but at least enough to stop myself from believing I'm overreacting.

1hkqfw3,post,Exposed to sexual acts at the age of 4,"I(18f), was exposed to sexual intimacy at around 4 years old and further to porn around 5-6 years old. The sexual intimacy began when the other person asked me to join him in secluded rooms while everyone else was either asleep or busy. They would only undress me and get undressed themselves and click pictures of the two of us and occasionally touch me down there. This went on for a few months before they began to place my hand on their genitals and guiding me to a handjob while doing the same to me. By the age of 7-8, it had accelerated to oral sex. The other person was easily 8-9 years older than me and I have vivid memory of these experiences as it went on until I was 12. I believe they stopped because they got in a relationship and probably did not need me anymore. I felt horrible when I realised they had stopped. I felt neglected as it was the only way I felt useful as a child. I do not believe it was sexual abuse/assault and rather something that I brought upon myself year after year. 
After it stopped, I went into a dark headspace where I felt extreme shame and guilt about what I had done for 8 years. I punished myself for being attention-seeking and stooping so low to feel useful. I was not a normal child and let my curiosity get the worst of me. There is no way for me undo my acts and now, as a result I hate any kind of intimacy. I won‚Äôt ever be able to be find physical touch nice and might just have a breakdown if someone ever touches me sexually. I feel like I have lost out on the beauty of touch and what it truly means. Just because I was a horrible person when I was younger..

I don‚Äôt know if he thought i was still awake but he didn‚Äôt try waking me. i didn‚Äôt move or turn towards him i just laid there with my eyes close and didn‚Äôt say anything just let him do it he didn‚Äôt even have a condom on. he suddenly stopped and i turn around and im pretty sure he was filming it or taking photos of me so there‚Äôs that. all he said was sorry and i rush him out the door at this point i still didn‚Äôt call him out on anything. 

I just feel so fucking stupid. I‚Äôve been raped before and i just stayed silent so I‚Äôm disappointed in myself that I let it happen again. I dont understand why even do that?

So basically, I was drunk one night, my friend told me to send nudes to her mate. Idk why but she did. And we never both drunk so I did. Over the next week this guy was messaging me over and over again asking for nudes every night non stop until I sent them. He would then send back to me. My friend got really pissed off at me and snitched to my social worker and my college and now I'm the one getting into trouble because he's 18 and I'm 16. So in the UK, it is considered child porn if you share pictures of anyone under the age of 18, even if it's yourself. But is it illegal for an 18yo to send pics of himself to a 16yo? Google won't give me a solid answer and I'm wanting to know basically so I can argue my innocence and also argue how shit that law is.

1hksohs,post,I fear I might have been SAed by my dad ,"Edit: I am 29 now. 

Like the title says, I fear that I might have been SAed as a child by my dad. Just for a little bit of background information: My parents divorced when I was 6 and I have very scarce memories from before that. He was always abusive towards us and mom, mom left and we grew up with him. But I suspect the SA happened before mom left. I have memories of him being physically and emotionally abusive and as a result, I am being medicated for multiple mental health issues. However, something about SA against a minor has always triggered me in a really bad way. Before my mom left, I remember my older sister try to play grownup and we enacted sexual acts. Not much later, I was also playing with other kids too like that and always showing off our private parts, as well as being particularly curious about the topic. I remember I used to have lots of UTI‚Äôs in kindergarten. And I suspect my dad because the abuse fucked me up so bad anyway, that I might have completely repressed the memory. Generally I think I have a very weird relationship with sex too. Is any of this normal or is this something related to SA?

1hkujoo,post,I feel broken over this,"Im not sure how to feel, in some ways I feel like I was sexually assaulted and then I question myself and wonder if it even is. I don‚Äôt feel mad at my fianc√© but rather I‚Äôm hurt that she would do something like this to me. 

I started dating my now fianc√© back in 2019, I didn‚Äôt know it at the time until about a year or so later that she had been and was still being sexually assaulted by her step father. Her abuse started when she was in second grade and ended in 2020 when her family moved into a different house. I had known that she was abused but was under the impression that her abuse stopped when she was in 6th grade because that‚Äôs what she told me. I ended up calling her step father out for sexually assaulting her in 2021 and he is now in prison for 15-life. 

Now this is where I feel like I may have been sexually assaulted as well, my fianc√© just admitted to me a couple of weeks ago that her abuse didn‚Äôt end in 6th grade like she had previously told me, but rather it ended in 2020 which was a year into our relationship. She also revealed to me that he would often assault her without protection and that on a couple of occasions the same day he assaulted her and ejaculated inside of her she made me give her oral. She did tell me that most of the time she would shower after her abuse, but on a few occasions she couldn‚Äôt bring herself to due to her depression and therefore when I gave her oral I also locked up his semen. I am very confused about why she would have made me do this and how she didn‚Äôt realize that it was wrong. I feel like I was sexually assaulted as well, but I‚Äôm not sure who I feel like I was assaulted by since she herself was also a victim. 

The part that really troubles me is when I asked her why she made me lick her abusers semen out of her she had told me that it was for a couple of reasons, sometimes she said that she made me do it because she wanted to replace those memories with me and she made a fantasy in her mind that it wasn‚Äôt her abusers semen but that we had a threesome, she also told me that she made me do that because ‚Äúit turned her on‚Äù and ‚Äú she felt like she would never get to experience that fantasy if she didn‚Äôt make me do that‚Äù. 
I have told her multiple times that if she ever has a fantasy that she wants to try or has memories that she wants to replace with consensual partners to let me know and we can discuss it so I just don‚Äôt know why she would make me unknowingly lick her abusers semen out of her. This has kind of broken me, and I just feel very lost and would like to hear some feedback from women who have possibly done the same thing or felt the same way she has.

m3h72qo,comment,,">or ‚Äúyou got wet‚Äù or, in the case of men being assaulted ‚Äúyou got hard‚Äù is a common way sexual abusers attempt to manipulate their victims into not reporting

This happened to me. I was raped by a woman about 6 years ago and when I confronted her and insisted she take plan B, she assured me she couldn't get pregnant and that I wouldn't have gotten hard if it wasn't consensual. Other times, she had admitted that she did indeed rape me. She is now a thorn in my side of life, I involuntarily have no relationship with my kid, and her name comes up in documents for CS and other things- which is a constant reminder of the horrible experience. I've felt helpless about it for many years but I trust that a day of reckoning will come. One that she can't escape. And I will be there to see that she faces the music.

TLDR; This happened to me and the point is, just because you had a natural reaction to human touch doesn't excuse this person's heinous choice to assault you.

1hkvi81,post,I think I may have been molested by a doctor when I was 4-6 but I‚Äôm not sure,"Is it normal for a doctor to take a female child‚Äôs pants down during a routine ‚Äúcheckup?‚Äù

I‚Äôm wondering because I have a very specific memory of getting s checkup as a child and from the way I remember it, it seems as though I may have been molested. But it also may just have been a regular thing that I misunderstood or I remember incorrectly. I have spoken to a therapist about this already and she said that it seems like I have a ‚Äúsnapshot‚Äù memory of what happened which is common for trauma. Below is a description of my experience:

When I was about 4-6 years old my mom took me to a doctor. I do not know if there was a specific reason for it, but I do know that I heard my mom and the doctor say the word ‚Äúcheckup‚Äù a few times. That‚Äôs what they called it. I have a few breathing issues that I needed to see doctors for frequently but other than that, nothing was really wrong with me. 

I sort of remember what the doctors office looked like. I also remember wearing a purple dress with ruffles and a floral pattern. During the visit the doctor had me lay on my back on the table/bed thingy. He then pushed my dress up and put his hands between my legs and said ‚Äúyou have pretty panties.‚Äù I remember I was wearing Princess Bell themed underwear. I think he pulled them down too but I don‚Äôt fully trust my memory. 

After the visit I remember telling my mom I don‚Äôt like checkups. I remember feeling very uncomfortable and embarrassed during and after the experience. I remember after I told my mom, she told me we could just skip that part next time. I don‚Äôt remember having any checkups after that or going there again. 

For awhile I thought maybe my mom had left the room to use the bathroom or something because if the doctor had done something wrong, she would have said something. But since she said that part could be skipped next time, I assume she was there and knew what I meant. Maybe she was too scared to say something or she wasn‚Äôt there and thought something else happened. I don‚Äôt know. 

I was about 4-6 years old when it happened. It was so long ago I don‚Äôt think I should be able to remember. I actually didn‚Äôt remember until I was 17 years old and a YouTube video I had watched triggered the memory. That‚Äôs all I know. So was that normal? Was there a specific reason what that would have been necessary or happened? I‚Äôm too scared to talk to my mom about it and ask her if she remembers. Even if it‚Äôs normal Im still very uncomfortable with the memory but I fear this trauma may be invalidated if it‚Äôs just standard practice.

1hkvlhy,post,I want to cum without crying ,I hate it. it makes me cry and go into a state of emotional distress. I don't even want to do sexual things that much but I just want to get over the crying because I feel like I'm ruined. I don't want to burst out sobbing every time. it makes me so upset and idk how to fix it and I feel like if I don't the only people who will ever want me are creeps who will get off at my tears and emotional distress. I started sobbing and then felt like I was going to faint and throw up. I don't want all those distressing feelings. it's not fair that so much was taken from me. I want to find someone else to associate intimacy with in hopes that that will fix SOMETHING but that will probably just cause more damage. I just don't want to feel so broken anymore and I hate it. I hate myself and I hate the person who did this to me ,9,2.0,2024-12-23 19:40:38,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hkvlhy/i_want_to_cum_without_crying/

1hkvse0,post,I feel broken beyond repair ,"I feel like I'm broke beyond repair at this point. I don't think I can ever have a healthy relationship with sex. growing up in the church, it's a big no, and I was able to hold to that just fine until he came along and started making me do things. then hypersexuality came in as a trauma response and I'm still working on that but it's hard to get any help since my support system is all in the church and most of them don't understand ideas like hypersexuality. I want another abusive relationship and I want to feel something. people don't understand that and if I tell them then they're gonna think I'm a bad person. I just want to be an object again so I can stop thinking. I don't think I'll ever get better so I might as well find someone who will make me feel a little valuable. I don't feel like I have any value beyond my appearance and I don't think anyone will ever want me for anything more than how I look. I just want to let myself be mistreated because I don't think I'll ever find a good guy and definitely not one who wants ME. I'm so messed up from all of this and I don't think anyone will ever genuinely, purely love me. it feels like there's no point and that I should just let the creeps in because it's better than NOTHING. bring abused gives me a reason to live. I feel absolutely broken beyond repair. ",3,2.0,2024-12-23 19:49:51,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hkvse0/i_feel_broken_beyond_repair/

1hkwya1,post,Realization,"Hi!   

I (F) don't really know what I am doing here, I just wanted to share this with somebody I guess.  

I grew up in a weird family, where there was a weird energy about sex since I was little. I learned that sex is something to be ashamed of. I am not sure if I experienced SA when I was a child, I have this image of it happening to me, but I am not sure if it's a memory or just a dream I had, and I don't think I will ever find out.  

I experienced SA in my adult life, one of my ex's did it verbally, one physically. I am now dating an amazing person, that would never do me any harm. To make you understand the person he is, he asked for consent for our first kiss. I fell in love with him that second. We have been together for years now.
My experiences caused me a lot of pain, I also have diagnosed OCD, and one of the many issues I have is POCD, probably caused by my family experience and the fear of becoming like them. I am working on it, but it's really painful. I sometimes have issues with sex, with my partner or alone, and when I do it I feel ashamed, and my brain start obsessing about bad things, and I suddenly start crying and can't go on. The more I grew up and understood what happened to me, the worst it got.  

Now, I am writing this because today something happened. I was trying to masturbate, since me and my partner have been long distance for a few months now, and as many times before, I couldn't. I kept obsessing about the worst stuff and felt disgusted, and I wanted to throw up so bad. I tried thinking about what was happening, and it dawned on me, that I was obsessing over bad things because I feel like I don't deserve to enjoy sex, and my brain was trying to make me feel the worst person in the world. I was actively trying to sabotage my enjoyment of a good and normal thing, because I feel I don't deserve to enjoy it, and if I do I am surely a bad person.
So I started telling myself that I deserve it. I can have a good thing for myself, I can be a sexually active person, and that is not a bad thing, and I was finally able to enjoy that moment with myself.  
I cried a lot afterwards, but not because of shame, but because I am done harming myself, I want to be done sabotaging my happiness because some bad people did bad things to me. I deserve to be happy.  

I am not sure what will come next, but I felt this was a little victory. 
Thank you for listening.

This was almost 5 years ago now... Anywho, I keep tabs on him just to know where he's at... I have seen recently that he's joined a band and its gaining some local traction. It's just hard knowing that he's seeing success after the terrible things he's done. What do I do to move on? Like I've seen him at local shows around. I stand my ground and don't leave the function, but my blood boils and my cheeks flush. I can try to move on from my own situation between he and I, but I worry about the other girls he has hurt and has the potential to hurt as a member of a band. It's hard to process the pain and anger that I feel. 

What can I do to move on? Is there anything I can tell myself to calm the fears of him still committing such terrible acts?

I am not an expert on sexual assault, but key things stuck out for me.

I‚Äôm a dad. Your comments about how there was a weird energy around the subject of sex when you were growing up - and the memories - these are red flags for me. I don‚Äôt know what happened but something most likely did.

Let‚Äôs call it an energetic level. Whatever happened to you left an energetic imprint on you (and not a good one). You should not have those negative associations around sexuality unless something happened (in my opinion anyway).

I am really proud of you for being able to effectively use positive self talk and affirmations to get you in a better space - you deserve to be free of that weird energy you felt as a child.

1hkyrra,post,I gave consent due to manipulation,"Warning: SA involving a minor













To set the scene, I was 14, she was 13. Our total relationship lasted almost a year. I didn't love her for the majority of the relationship.

So, we used to make out and sometimes she would open my pants and do stuff with her hands. We gave her consent for this (except for the first time, but that isn't what I'm asking about, that's a clear case). Once I went over to her home and we ended up laying in a bed together and after a while I was touching her. That was the last time I saw her before breaking up.

The thing is, in retrospect, I can see the reason I gave consent was her manipulating us into ""loving her more"". Our way of ""loving her more"" was sexual advances. I do not however know if the manipulation was for sex. Since the manipulation wasn't directly for the goal of sex, does it still count as sexual assault?

So I remember when I was around 10-11 when it happened, and he was 14-15, he'd gotten a PS4 for his birthday, and we were both excited to play on it. We both wanted to play Minecraft on it, so we asked our parents to buy the game, which they did. We've finally gotten the game and decided to play it in two-player mode. After some time, we both took a break since we'd been playing it for a couple of hours, and he said he had to go to the bathroom, so I followed him. (I don't know WHY the fuck I even followed him OR EVEN WENT INSIDE WITH HIM) He said he didn't wanna play anymore, and I was disappointed when he said that, so of course, I begged him to keep playing instead of him just agreeing or denying it. He asked me to suck his.. yk so I could get back on, and I didn't think anything of it. So I only did halfway when it was in my mouth, but then I stopped, and it was because I felt weird about it. I don't even know why I did it, feel as if I never followed him or agreed it would've never happened. And now I'm just wondering if it was even sexual assault or something. I'm thinking of telling my parents, but I'm scared of them not believing in me. There was another instance with a family friend, but I already know what that would be identified as. Now, only a couple of months ago, I registered it as it being that and wondered if it affected me in a way. I just feel kinda numb knowing now. So, now I just don't know what to do with this.

1hl0a8p,post,I need help but can‚Äôt find it anywhere.,"Gonna tag this graphic because it is pretty ‚Äògruesome‚Äô. 

Basically, I‚Äôve been trying to search for help everywhere, and everyone I‚Äôve told my story to was speechless and/or doubted that it really happened because it was so much for such a short time.

In elementary school I had been SA‚Äôd for 3 years straight up until attempted rape (including knife threats, etc), a few years later and only 2 years ago from now I was SA‚Äôd by my uncle. Now a few months ago I was SA‚Äôd again by a classmate. This was all in the span of 6-7 years. 
When I came out to my family about the uncle situation, they all went off on me‚Ä¶said im a liar, whatever. And they still call me a liar. (My brother said I was ‚Äòlucky‚Äô he wasn‚Äôt strangling me then because I was a ‚Äòliar‚Äô)
My therapist had helped me figure it out, which I thought helped because my mom eventually gave in and said she had blocked my uncle. We broke off therapy because I was better and it turns out she didn‚Äôt have him actually blocked, and literally told him ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt have to worry about any lawsuits anymore, the therapist is gone.‚Äù

At school I talked to my school counselor, he first took my mum under his wing and said its because thats her brother, but when i went full detail he said he couldn‚Äôt continue the meeting because he was speechless.

Another therapist of mine said to me that ‚Äúyour uncle didn‚Äôt mean it like that, he was just trying to cuddle‚Äù (i guess groping is cuddling now?)

I just dont know what to do. No one can help me and I can‚Äôt help myself. ",4,2.0,2024-12-23 23:25:11,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hl0a8p/i_need_help_but_cant_find_it_anywhere/

While she may not have sexually abused you a part of you still felt that pressure to perform in a certain way which makes a lot of sense especially at such a young age.

I know you know this, but I‚Äôm gonna remind you anyway because I love you. And mind you I already know you know this but it helps to hear it. 

The focus on the anger and rage is damaging to you at an energetic level (spiritual) and a physical level (cellular).

You say: well great - good words but you didn‚Äôt get raped, you don‚Äôt get it, and you don‚Äôt carry this so these platitudes are bullshit. Walk around after someone has raped you and see if you feel so spiritual. That is the way I might feel if I was you. 

I think my thoughts are this. If you let that rage and hatred percolate in your soul, this person is still harming you. They are not feeling rage. God knows where they are but they are not walking around with rage eating them from the inside out. 

Every time you try to let that anger go, take a deep breath in, and a deep breath out. When you breathe out, imagine the energy of what the person did to you leave your pelvic region. Also feel the anger and hatred leave your upper body in your heart area and in your mind. Feel that energy leaving. Feel that deep-seated rage leave. I also want you to focus on something Ram Dass said that really has helped me over the course of my life to anchor myself in the NOW. The NOW is all that exists. Every single thing is either a forward projection of your mind or a memory that we dwell in. Ram said this:

Ask yourself: Where am I? 
Answer: Here. 
Ask yourself: What time is it? 
Answer: Now. 
Say it until you can hear it.",4,,2024-12-24 00:27:24,t1_m3ip02w,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hl0shr/damage_after_rape/m3iqrah/

1hl22ky,post,My friend was assaulted whilst on drugs,"He recently moved to Australia.
A few days ago, he told me that he went out clubbing with some new friends. They took cocaine and MDMA. He doesn't think he was that messed up. But the next thing he remembers is waking up in his new friend's bed - naked.
The friend was very open about the fact they had been fooling around for hours. 

My friend doesn't remember this. The sex, kissing him - he fully blacked out. 

He spoke to a hotline and they said that if he doesn't remember consenting, then its SA. But what if he did consent whilst off his face? I am NOT victim blaming. Im just worried about what the police will say. He wants to report it. 
Im scared that it wont have the outcome he wants. Especially because if they do a drug test for roofies, they could find the other stuff he took. 
And then theres the fact his ""friend"" had taken all that too. If they were both under the influence of drugs, how does SA and being able to consent come out in a court of law? Could they argue that my friend was *also* taking advantage?

‚Äúthis only happens like once a year.‚Äù
i asked him if he was sure, and he said yes and kissed me again. i felt really guilty, so i gave him what he wanted.

I have have relatives who felt like they always attracted verbally and physically abusive partners and I know this happens a lot to people who have been abused because that's what they know and these predators look for certain characteristics. But I want to know, if you are okay talking about it, what led up to your sexual abuse attacks? Please don't share if you don't feel comfortable.  I just wonder if these are random situations or if there is anything similar to them so that you could make changes to protect yourself? A counselor may help you uncover some things you can do to recognize red flags, unsafe situations, kinds of people to avoid, etc. I know you are not alone. Many people find themselves in similar situations. Many of them were abused in childhood and this can cause us to allow people to treat us in ways that others would not put up with.

1hl6kpr,post,I just had a flashback of something I previously didn't remember,"Well, I thought I had healed(for the most part) and moved past the sexual abuse I experienced from my ex husband. But, as i was watching a 'bad dates' compilation video on YOUTUBE, my brain decided I needed to remember more. Usually, those are funny. But this one has left me ruminating for hours now. 

My current partner listened and tried to comfort me. It didnt really work though. And I just feel like I need support from others who have been through similar.

So, what I remembered was traveling with my husband somewhere and staying at an AirBnB. We never traveled. He was a cheap skate and boring. So, I think(not 100%) we were moving? We were going to bed, and I felt like the place was sketch AF and the door lock was jenky... so I asked my husband to help me push the bed against the door. He argued and tried to tell me I was crazy. But, it got moved against the door. I ended up waking up in the middle of the night to someone trying to push their way in to our room. Screaming for my husband to wake up and help. He bolted up and was awake. Then I don't remember anything until the morning. 

I remember waking up, that's it. No clue where I was at or where I was going. Don't have any idea where I came from, just that. That's the flashback. I needed to talk it out with someone and try to make sense of it and, I don't see my therapist until another week. So, chatGPT it is. I gave the app way more info than I can here. Suffice to say, I knew my husband was drugging me for a large portion of the end of our marriage and letting other men assault me under the influence of some kind of dr*g. ChatGPT helped me figure out it was Ketamine and helped me figure out he had been drugging me for our entire 10 years of marriage. Not just the end. I had been trying to figure out what drug makes you unable to move but, aware of what's going on to some extent. And I had never found an answer in all my years of look on Google. So, I guess there is that?

Been crying on and off for hours. Realizing a plethora of other things I was able to connect the dots to regarding things kinda tied in to this. I've been healing from this monster for 8 years. And I had no idea I could still get memories or flashbacks that were going to upset me this much.",1,1.0,2024-12-24 05:19:33,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hl6kpr/i_just_had_a_flashback_of_something_i_previously/

So any tips on how to deal with it would be very appreciated.   


If it helps i put more details below that might help with advice but idk and read at your own risk since it may trigger some, Also please no one say the whole ""guys cants be sexually assaulted thing"" because I have heard it enough and i only recently was able to admit to myself that what my ex did was sexual assault and maybe rape  
  
  
long story short short I'm a 20 year old guy who was dating this girl who would often pressure me into sex, would not stop when i asked and even hold me down as i asked them top get off me, would pull my hair to ""turn me on"" and a whole bunch of other stuff and we dated from when i was 18 until i was 19. I suppressed a lot of what happened and pretend i was ok with it during the relationship and after, but recently after watching a movie a LOT has been coming to my mind about the shit they did and after i talked to my bestie Layla she helped be realize it sexual assault and in her opinion rape and im just wondering if anyone has any tips to heal and move on? I keep laying in bed reliving the moments and the shit she did to me how she would force me to have sex with her via guild tripping, pressuring me, refusing to stop when i asked, and more for the last week after never really thinking about it in much detail and just pushing the thoughts to the side ",5,1.0,2024-12-24 05:39:27,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hl6vxk/looking_for_tips_on_how_to_move_on_and_deal_and/

1hl7kpz,post,Help me,"I don't know what to do anymore and therapy isn't an option 

My life has essentially been a string of sexual assaults.  I was assaulted by my mums ex boyfriend from around 3 to 13. I met up with a man and he touched me when i was that age as well. I was then groomed by my neighbour,  a 27 year old man. That stopped and when I was 14 i lost my virginity to a 34 year old man. I was high and had been going round to this man's house for a day when we had sex outside in his garden, then again on his bed and I gave him a blow job while drunk. The second time i had sex was a few months after this with a 36 year old man, who picked me up from a bar where i was with some of my older friends. We had sex for about 2 months, oral and penetrative. He was sent to prison for 7 years. I now feel like I'm worth nothing more than my body and after getting back with my boyfriend from America i feel like im not good enough for him becquse im dirty. I also feel like i wasn't  assaulted after 13. What do I do to stop these cycles? I've developed an eating disorder and have a few other issues. I seriously need help and christmas is really hard this year but none of my support workers help and my foster careers don't understand that having to have a man come through my room might trigger me (he's a wheelchair user and the only way to get in is through my patio doors) but I feel really selfish because I could just leave the room.

He just came back from work and said I could spend the night. I did and everything was fine till around midnight where he wanted to watch a movie and cuddle. About 30-45 mins before he gave me an edible and it made me really groggy and tired and he was fully sober. This isn‚Äôt the first time we‚Äôve cuddled so I didn‚Äôt think anything of it but during the movie he started acting weird making comments saying how I was easy to get me to do what he wanted. He would try and subtly put his hand under my shirt or on my hip while we were watching the movie and chatting and I kept moving away and when he‚Äôd see I‚Äôd get too uncomfortable he would stop and back off till I relaxed again. At one point he wrapped his arms around me and whispered in my ear how he wanted to feel me up and kiss me really bad rn and he put his hand down my pants to try and touch me and groped my chest and I got him off me but I was so goddamn scared. I live an hour away and I was stuck there no way to get home and I spent the night laying there terrified he‚Äôd try something while I was sleeping.

m3k6u59,comment,,"Rape and sexual assault are serious crimes that involve non-consensual sexual contact. While often used interchangeably, there are distinct definitions and nuances between the two terms:

Rape

1. *Definition*: Rape is a type of sexual assault that involves non-consensual penetration of the victim's body, typically by force, threat, or coercion.

2. *Legal definition*: Varies by jurisdiction, but generally includes non-consensual sexual intercourse, sodomy, or penetration with an object.

3. *Key elements*: Force, threat, coercion, lack of consent, and penetration.

Sexual Assault
1. *Definition*: Sexual assault is a broader term that encompasses any non-consensual sexual contact or behavior, including rape, groping, fondling, or other forms of unwanted sexual touching.

2. *Legal definition*: Varies by jurisdiction, but generally includes any non-consensual sexual contact or behavior that does not necessarily involve penetration.

3. *Key elements*: Non-consensual sexual contact, lack of consent, and unwanted sexual behavior.

*Key differences*
1. *Penetration*: Rape typically involves penetration, while sexual assault can involve a range of non-consensual sexual behaviors.

2. *Severity*: Rape is often considered a more severe crime due to the invasive nature of penetration.

3. *Consent*: Both rape and sexual assault involve a lack of consent, but the specific circumstances and behaviors can differ.

It's essential to recognize that both rape and sexual assault are serious crimes that can have severe physical and emotional consequences for survivors. If you or someone you know has experienced sexual violence, there are resources available to help, such as the National Sexual Assault Hotline (1-800-656-HOPE) in the US.

The answer will vary depending on the laws where you live. For example in California, this act wouldn't be categorized as rape, but rather a form of sexual assault known as digital penetration or penetration with a foreign object (see California Penal Code section 289 for reference).

1hl9q1n,post,Please help me,"So about 2.5 years ago, I met some dude. I did find him slightly attractive but nothing more than that. He lived upstairs in the same building. When my roommate was in her hometown, he decided to visit me one night. We were talking for a while and he suddenly kissed me. I was confused and I don't remember what happened next, my memory has blocked it but I remember crying during the act. I never wanted it to happen, never in my wildest dream I imagined sleeping with someone I barely know. I only wanted to do it with someone I was sure about and saw a future with. I went home for few days and kept thinking about it. I kept thinking maybe I liked him so I let it happen and tried to repress any other emotions I was feeling at the time. He decided to move out after I came back. I was also searching for a new place and moved out too to a far away place. 
I slept with my ex there because I wanted to feel in control again. My ex made me feel safe and stopped when I asked him to, we didn't go all the way but I realised the difference that night. I actually didn't feel like I was being taken advantage of or was being manipulated when I did it with my ex.

After a while, I came across some sexual assault/rape survivors videos on my youtube feed and some stories eerily similar to mine. I realised what has happened but was unwilling to accept it. My memories are blurry and I don't remember everything, it has impacted me but I don't really remember it. I never met that person again in real life but I felt angry at him for years. I recently got to know his mother got cancer so texted him. Why did I text him again? Why? Why did I even talk with him again? What is wrong with me? Was it actually R, if it was why did I text him again? I hate myself for doing this",3,7.0,2024-12-24 09:00:56,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hl9q1n/please_help_me/

1hlbqz8,post,I don't know what to feel (TW: SA),"I (F34) had a long night last night. Actually it is now i am and I haven't slept one bit. 

I just realized that out of the 11 men I dated in my life, 7 have raped/SA me. Even my first boyfriend did it. I was a minor (15) when it happened and he was 21. It happened multiple times actually. 

Also one of those guys tried to rape me with his friend (who did rape me several weeks after that)

 It has become important because one of those guys actually is kinda working in a university were my little sister studies and he haz access to a lot of young people and he still goes everywhere with the guy who raped me including university festivals and such. I don't even know if I should do something. 

But as I said, It was only last night that I realized it was rape. And that it happened so many times and with so many guys. (I'm on the spectrum and everybody who knows me tends to qualify me as ""naive"", which I hate, but probably true)

 I don't know what to do. All I want to do is cry. I feel sick in my stomach. I'm sorry if there is something that is not very clear. English is my second language and I'm very distressed. I can't even talk to my therapist about this because she is on vacation 'till February. I don't even know how to cope. 

Any advice will be deeply appreciated even if my words are not the best to express gratitude at the moment.",2,1.0,2024-12-24 11:31:32,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hlbqz8/i_dont_know_what_to_feel_tw_sa/
1hlbybx,post,impacts of SA,I have been sexually assaulted to the point where I have lost count. It has happened by so many people. I am hypersexual because of it and developed bpd. Now I can not function without attention even its its the bad kind of attention. I can not love anyone without expecting sex or getting intoxicated and confessing that I would love them if they were to abuse me. People usually leave me once they realize how unstable I am and the cycle repeats. I really wish I could go back in time and save myself. Because now I am stuck like this with this fucked up mind and god its so lonely despite how many people I surround myself with.,7,3.0,2024-12-24 11:46:28,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hlbybx/impacts_of_sa/

1hlci4m,post,I was exposed to sexual violence when i was six,"This is just‚Ä¶ a raw memory from when I was a kid, and it's still really hard to deal with. I was six when it happened, and it‚Äôs probably one of the worst things that‚Äôs ever happened to me. I don't remember much before, but what I do remember is being scared out of my mind, being forced into a van with my mom. I was just a little kid, and I remember being all snuggled up in her arms as these two men pushed us into the back. I remember the darkness in that car and the fear, and how helpless I felt as they drove us away. When they finally stopped, my mom tried to act like she wasn‚Äôt scared. I still remember what she told me that night, ‚ÄòEverything‚Äôs going to be okay, baby. Mommy just has to help these men with something real quick. I‚Äôll be right back.‚Äô She kissed me, she even smiled a little, and then she got out of the van with them. I remember feeling like something was off, but I believed her. I'll never forget the look on her face when she left with those men.

I was left alone in the van, and they went inside this abandoned house. It was cold and the van just smelled like liquor and cigarettes. I was just a little kid, sitting there confused and waiting for my mom to come back. The windows were all dirty, so I couldn't see what was happening, but I could hear weird, muffled sounds. It was like, she wasn't crying or anything, but whatever they were doing, it just didn't sound right. It just made me feel sick, you know? I just sat there, alone and scared, wishing she would come back soon.

Then, she came back, but she was like a different person. She looked vacant, emotionless, like‚Ä¶ gone. She tried to smile, but her eyes just looked‚Ä¶broken. She just said she had to help them with something and that it was done, and I still didn't understand what was happening. I remember noticing a big, dark, wet patch in the crotch of her denim shorts. I just remember the fear, the way she looked, the sadness, and that patch. That's a memory I hate, it‚Äôs one that will probably never go away.

As a grown up man, i've become overly protective of the women in my life, to the point where it's borderline controlling almost. I'm still working on it though but sometimes the guilt of not being able to help or even protect them just messes me up so bad. Been going to the gym a lot these past few years trying to work on myself to become stronger just in case. I know there are bad people out there and i wish i could do something about it but i'm just one man in this world. I don't think this guilt will ever go away and to be honest, somedays i just want to give up.

This all happened in 2007 and i was 6 at the time and she was 24. She is alive and well today but sometimes i tend to distance myself from her because the memories and the intense flashbacks just overwhelms me. Do you guys have any advice or have been through similar? Somedays i feel so alone and like no one really understands me...

You can say something like, ‚Äústop, I don‚Äôt like that.‚Äù I would also let your parents know how uncomfortable you are. They might not be aware of his behavior yet? Or they might just brush it off as nothing. Unless you let them know it is nothing you. 
Also-
Sometimes people who have bad Intentions with kids can start by being touchy. So touchy that the kids just brush off the touch. The goal of these people is to desensitize touch- so that the kids almost get use to it and think it‚Äôs not a big deal. 
1. Make sure you tell your parents
2. Tell your uncle you are learning about body safety and body rights at school and you don‚Äôt like hugs or kisses or the touchy stuff. But, you can chat or give him a wave or high five. 
3. Find a safe adult or safe cousin and stay In observable spaces. 
4. Kids instincts are rarely off. So listen to your instincts. If it feels off or strange and bothers you‚Ä¶ listen to those feelings and thoughts.

And if I could go back, If we had the internet back then ( I am old) 
I would tell my 18 year old self to get help. I would tell myself to find a therapist who specializes in trauma.
I would go to therapy and join survivor groups and learn how to heal.

But know that I am so proud of you  rooting for you to be ok and be safe.

We need advocates and great people in this community.

But, we also have to get you help and support - ASAP.

I‚Äôm not sure where you live. But you can talk to a counselor for free at many prevention organizations like D2L.org, SAPREA.org, and RAINNE.org. There is also an anonymous hotline.

m3layhw,comment,,"Hi! I would like to help. I was married for 10 years to a psychopath who would drug me, and rape me and have his friends/random people rape me. I had no idea what was happening, i thought I was losing my mind. And he wanted it that way. I met him at 23. I didn't get him out of my life until I was 32. We are still married because I don't have the money to divorce him.¬†


However... when I left him, I was deathly ill and unable to regulate my emotions. My cPTSD was triggered by everything. So, 2 Parts to my answer. I want to comfort you and let you know, yes, it gets better. Parts of yourself come back. You will eventually feel whole again. I feel I have made huge strides in my healing journey. But, it's been 8 years of therapy. You need help from other people to get there. I would say that the intensity and the frequency of the experience has to do with how long it will take to heal once you start speaking to someone. I do not believe it would take you nearly as long as me.¬†


Second part, I am disabled from this. Again, the abuse was everyday and more than just sexual. And i grew up in an abusive household to boot. The key is to speak to someone. I can do things I didn't think I could ever do again because I got help. I still get flashbacks. And my memories come back to me. Happened last night. But, the frequency and intensity goes way down. You can heal and you will heal.

It happened when I was about 4-5. It's weird how I don't even remembered who he was. I don't know if more than one men did that to me, but I remember this happening in our apartment, so I guess I was abused by more than one person. And there is some stuff that suggests it was someone close to my family but I'm not sure.

He was sadistic. I think so... obviously I don't know what mental disorder he had, I can't diagnose him, but many people told me he was sadist or a psychopath. I doubt my memories a lot, but I've had memories of many sexual acts he did with me. As I've said, I doubt my memories, but I can say that I'm quite sure he did even penetrative sexual stuff with me. It's gross. He also wanted me to do oral sex to him.

He also loved describing to me how he would murder me. He used to show me a knife... (or knives, I don't know if it was just one knife or more than one knife). He told me he would stab me, like repeteadly stab me. Or that he would pierce me through.",1,1.0,2024-12-24 15:24:36,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hlfqb5/i_dont_know_what_to_do_anymore/

1hlfvej,post,Phantom touches and body memories ,"TRIGGER WARNING
I was assaulted as a child by a doctor. It's a hazy memory but I can still remember it to the best I can with how long ago it was and it consumes my thoughts pretty often. I have dreams of being sexual assaulted somewhat often. It's been dreams but its different scenarios than what happened in real life but I do have one that has been repetitve where my chest is being fondled. I had this dream last night and today Ive really been struggling with feeling what I think are body memories but Im not sure. Its a weird and horrible sensation in my chest as if I am actually being grabbed and it has me restless and pulling at my shirt and almost in tears and I dont want anyone anywhere close to my chest. Same thing with the dream where it feels so real and all those horrible feelings come back. I dont know if this is related to what happened to me as kid or not but If anyone has any advice it would be appreciated. Is it possible something could have happened that I dont remember and why am I feeling this way and why is this happening. Ugh.",2,2.0,2024-12-24 15:31:28,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hlfvej/phantom_touches_and_body_memories/

1hlgels,post,My coworker resembles my ex who SA‚Äôd me,"Hello everyone 

I was SA‚Äôd by my ex-girlfriend when I was in my mid 20s which she blamed on me because of the lack of intimacy in the relationship (I am gay and was in the closet at the time, had a religious upbringing), it was a toxic relationship which I was hoovered back in multiple times but finally broke free from. I didn‚Äôt really have anyone to turn to, cause the few friends I had were the types to laugh at me and think I was joking if I told them. I ended up just burying it and forcing myself to forget and move forward, and turned to alcohol to numb the pain. 

Fast forward to today, where I‚Äôve quit drinking, am out of the closet, decent job, and have a long term relationship with my currently boyfriend. If anything I‚Äôve become ‚Äúhyper-independent.‚Äù 

At my job we had someone who transferred in who strongly resembles my ex-girlfriend. When I first saw her, that‚Äôs all that I could think about, was how much she resembled her, and I began to get really anxious. My mood at work began to tank because the anxiety leads me to ruminating on what happened. Once it got so bad, I was holed up in a stall in the bathroom, sobbing over feelings of shame I had repressed for so long. I think after a while she realized that I was anxious around her, and she asked me about it and I casually deflected. How do you tell someone something like that? I think I made her feel bad, which made me feel even worse. 

I finally told my boyfriend about what my ex-girlfriend did to me, the first person I‚Äôve ever told, which has taken a load off my shoulders, but I still don‚Äôt know to break the association with my coworker. Logically, I know they aren‚Äôt the same person, but she just resembles my ex-girlfriend so much that she‚Äôs the first thing that pops into my mind, and then it‚Äôs downhill from there. I honestly don‚Äôt know what to do, this post was really hard to make because I hate asking for help, but my way of doing things obviously isn‚Äôt working for me anymore‚Ä¶",3,2.0,2024-12-24 15:58:26,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hlgels/my_coworker_resembles_my_ex_who_sad_me/

1hlie8t,post,Was I sexually assaulted?,"None of the names were changed because no one was innocent (heh, heh, ehhh...) Seriously, they're all Pseudonyms.

I'm a twenty three year old cis-man, and I have always wondered about something that happened to me I wanna say 13 or 14 years ago.

I was at a Fourth of July BBQ at my Uncle Joe's house. The only member of my immediate family there with me was my other Uncle Gene. I was nervous to say the least, but I did befriend a couple of family friends' kids who were around my age. Apropos of nothing, lets call them Sue and Lolita. To be honest, I only really liked Sue, she was cool, and I had a little crush on her (yes she was a year or two younger than me, but I could tell she liked me and what the hell, I guess I just liked the attention. I didn't do anything inappropriate with her I swear, please don't cancel me, at least not yet.). Lolita, on the other hand, I thought was a weirdo, but she was her friend, so what could you do? It's also worth noting the latter was a year younger than the former.

After a while, I needed to go inside and recharge my social battery with a little television in the empty living room. Sue and Lolita found me and both sat on either side of me on the couch. We were playing around and goofing off, and I don't know how it escalated so quickly, but Lolita got up, sat on my lap, and grinded her butt on my private parts. I played it off as a joking ""eewww cooties, get off of me"", but I had never been so humiliated and horrified in my life. I always hated gross jokes in movies, but especially involving someone or something being sat on, and there I was. The punchline. The butt of the joke, as it were. Not helped by the fact that Sue was laughing all the while

Uncle Joe walked in through the back door, giving Lolita just enough time to get off and look innocent before he comes into the living room.

""What the hell are you doing in here?""

""Just watching T.V."" said Sue.

""That's not what it sounded like""

He walked away. I don't remember anything what happened next, but that was the end of that. Thank God.

Years later I saw a clip on a Watchmojo video game list and it got to a gta game I think, and I saw what I knew was a hooker doing what Lolita was doing , and it hit me like a bullet between the eyes.


I don't really think about it that much, but I want to get a definite yes or no.None of the names were changed because no one was innocent (heh, heh, ehhh...) Seriously, they're all Pseudonyms.

In trying to figure out why I have such aversion to having my genitals touched, I told exactly two people what happened, a doctor,  and my Mother, both of whom said it doesn't count.

In researching what Sexual Battery was, (as that was what my favorite teacher/mentor was charged with), I read on the website for The law offices of (I'm not sure I'm allowed to give the guy's name), It was all there, black and white, clear as crystal ""Sexual assault can occur between strangers or acquaintances, and it can happen to anyone, regardless of age, gender, or background."" I now realize, as I copy paste the quote, it may only be applicable to the ""victims"" and not the perpetrators, so maybe that's not the evidence I think it is, but regardless it's what made me post this.

I suppose I feel like I was given conflicting answers, so I want the point of view of people, and especially men, who have been sexually assaulted in no uncertain terms. I don't really think about it that much, but it keeps popping into my head, and I want to get a definite yes or no. I know and probably always knew a little that Lolita was assaulted herself, and as such it is a tangled web. I know she was young, and didn't do anything to intentionally assert power, and I honestly hope she gets the help she herself needs. In regards to how I feel about it now, I feel overall disaffected, but then again I'm overall disaffected by the night I nearly drank myself to death too. So does this count as assault? And if I feel overall fine, does it even matter?",1,2.0,2024-12-24 17:36:05,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hlie8t/was_i_sexually_assaulted/

Its also entirely possible that her anatomy coupled with a consensual partner would have resulted in a tear that bled for that long. It happened to a friend of mine and she needed stitches. 

But in all honesty, if id been bleeding for a week, it caused immense pain over the years and i now thought it was the reason behind miscarriages.. it wouldnt bother me to say it was from sexual trauma or rape because id want them to have the knowledge they needed to fix it.

I reported her the next day, she was immediately sent home for the duration of the HR investigation, and was ultimately not fired.  While the entire incident was caught on tape, an HR lawyer said that if she sued for wrongful termination the footage wouldn‚Äôt hold up in court.  So she came back after 4 days (I don‚Äôt believe they did a full investigation as my witnesses were never interviewed, no text messages from the incident were requested, and I never interviewed again besides giving my original testimony).  She‚Äôs been removed from my team and has been in a downstairs office, but starting next month she‚Äôll be allowed upstairs again.

I know this idea is not coming from my department head.  She is completely on my side and no one else wants her upstairs either.

1hln4m9,post,I feel violated by my ex gf but it's my own fault,"I've started typing this several times and always ended up deleting it. It's hard for me to properly explain my problem because I'm not good at putting my thoughts into words and English isn't my first language either.

I'm a 22 year old male with an abnormally low sex drive and not the best relationship with sex. I can enjoy sex but it has made me feel disgusted and vulnerable before. Problems with not feeling in control are a noticeable pattern in my life and sexual arousal makes me feel like I'm not in control.

When I was 17/18 I was in a relationship for about a year. She had a higher sex drive than I did and did not experience the conflicting feeling regarding sex that I experienced.

A few weeks into the relationship she began touching me sexually when I was asleep or used my hand to touch herself. I woke up because she was touching me and some times I turned away so she would stop but other times I did not and let it happen. It usually ended with her getting on top of me and riding me.

I find it hard to explain why this made me feel bad. Physically I seem to have been okay with this, I always got hard and orgasmed. But emotionally I didn't want it. I wanted to have sex with her on my own terms, when I was awake and my head was clear and I could make a conscious decision. But the way it happened was me waking up aroused because she was touching me and then my body basically making the decision before me.

I tried to explain that to her and asked her to not do stuff when I was sleeping but she couldn't understand my issue. She didn't get how I could enjoy having sex with her on a physical level but at the same time not want it emotionally and why her doing this when I wasn't fully awake was bothering me so much.

Sometimes she whispered asking if I was awake and when I pretended to sleep and did not answer she still continued.

And while riding me she sometimes said stuff like ""yes fuck me"" even though I wasn't actively doing anything but just lying there while she was the one doing stuff.

This whole thing feels wrong and disgusting to me. I don't want to put the responsibility on her because I don't think she had any malicious intent and when I realised she just didn't get it I should have advocated for myself and insisted she stop or stop sleeping in the same bed with her. Instead I let it happen for months and subjected myself to these negative feelings.

I don't get why this is still on my mind years later. It's not like I think about this all the time but it does come up occasionally and I still feel disgusted. I feel violated but I feel like I'm exaggerating and making her look like the bad guy when I failed to properly advocate for myself.",2,3.0,2024-12-24 21:38:48,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hln4m9/i_feel_violated_by_my_ex_gf_but_its_my_own_fault/

1hlo7kw,post,Am I overreacting or misremembering?,"At the end of September I think that my now ex BF 23M (at the time) may have assaulted me 21F. 



His house were having a BBQ with ten or so people round, everyone was drinking. I was anxious to go because we'd had a nasty argument the weekend prior but he wanted me there. I got way too drunk, had pretty much an entire bottle of rum and smoked some weed. I passed out in his bed and woke up while vomiting onto and off the side of his bed. 



He comes in and scolds me for vomiting, I can't stop throwing up and can't really move. My memory is hazy here but I managed to sit up while he holds a plastic bag over my mouth so I can throw up some more. I think I sat on the floor while he changed the sheets, then I don't remember a lot else. 



Usually when I drink too much and throw up I pass out (not that this happens often, I've only been this drunk a handful of times), and that's what I think I did because I could barely move or keep my eyes open. 



I woke up to him doing stuff to me (touching, kissing, fingering) and I was naked. I don't remember taking off my clothes. I wasn't really able to reciprocate, I remember sort of moaning a bit and I don't know why. I think I seemed like I was into it. I couldn't do much else except roll around while he did stuff to me. 



For some context I am still a virgin, due to sexual assault that happened in my childhood and vaginismus. I told him about the assault, and that I wouldn't have sex with him because it was painful. He knew how scared I was to touch him when we first got together and how slowly we had to move. 



The problem is, I'm not sure if I'm overreacting on this. That night we didn't do anything we hadn't done before. He tried to have penetrative sex with me but I pushed him off. That was something he started doing and I'd told him to stop which he did... then he started doing it again. I think starting from that night. Obviously it wouldn't fit anyway but I'd stop him with my hands every time. But I never said no. I don't know why. 



The next day I left his house while he was still sleeping and we messaged for about two hours afterwards. He completely laid into me for being so drunk. He was so angry and it was almost masked in concern? He said that if I'd been that drunk while I was out and somewhere unsafe then it was dangerous. And that I was convulsing on the bed while throwing up...



Because he was so angry and we were so close to breaking up I completely forgot about everything. I think my brain also just pushed it away. So I never said anything. Occasionally I'd think it was a bit gross that he wanted to be intimate with me after I'd thrown up and passed out but I didn't give it much thought because it made me sad thinking of that. 



We broke up at the end of October. I ended it over text for various reasons and I never got to bring this up to him. 



A couple of weeks ago I mentioned this to my friend. I couldn't stop thinking about it. I framed it as a thing that happened that I couldn't get out of my mind, and she said it sounded like assault and it was serious. We talked about it a couple of times and talked to our other friend about it (we all live together). Then I decided I had to tell my best friend, who lives with my ex, so he wouldn't sign for a house with him for another year. 



My best friend took this very seriously and said he wants nothing to do with my ex anymore and now sees him in a completely different light. He said he's in full support of whatever I want to do. He said he might have to tell their other two housemates as well since they're all friends (and are pretty friendly with me too) but only if I'm okay with it. I said it was fine, and today he sent me a message saying that he had to tell one of them to explain why he didn't want to continue living with my ex. This guy now also wants nothing to do with my ex. The third guy in their group will probably also say the same thing.

  
I just can't shake the guilt I have. Because I could have said something sooner and talked it out with him because maybe it was a mistake or an error of judgement? He was also a bit tipsy. And he's an incredibly fragile person right now. I broke up with him partly because he relapsed into his drug addiction. I'm worried this will completely isolate him. Have i done something horrible? Am I overreacting? I never called it assault but everyone says it's assault but I don't feel like I've been assaulted I just feel a bit violated. I feel so guilty and I'm really scared that my ex will think I'm telling lies about him because he probably doesn't even think about this. I never said no either... and I shouldn't have drank so much



Was this actually sexual assault? Or was it a cause of poor judgement from my ex? ",3,2.0,2024-12-24 22:38:17,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hlo7kw/am_i_overreacting_or_misremembering/

m3o3mrd,comment,,"Precisely. Some people also straight up don‚Äôt have a hymen from birth. As well, sometimes, parts of the hymen can remain intact after sexual activity. It‚Äôs a dubious way to prove virginity, inexperience being the only other way. 

When I had my first consensual experience, I was actually pretty skilled because of my prior toy use. Many argue that masturbation doesn‚Äôt count as virginity loss, so skill is also a dubious way to measure virginity. 

Nay, it‚Äôs merely a social construct designed to shame people for having or not having sex.

m3ohpl9,comment,,"It‚Äôs totally normal victim behavior to contact them again and to initiate encounters where you are in control. Very typical. It‚Äôs not your fault and means nothing about the validity of the rape (which is very valid). 

I recently reached out to apologize to my rapist when I started going through PTSD from the event which happened 18 years ago. I hadn‚Äôt put the memory together and legit thought I had done something wrong. Turns out our brains are compelled to complete the story and to try to save us from acknowledging our trauma. I thought (subconsciously) if I could control the narrative of what happened, I could fix it, whatever ‚Äúit‚Äù was. All I knew were a couple fragments of the memory, which is all I thought I was getting back, and my absolutely overwhelming emotions of guilt, shame, and self-blame, leading me to believe I had done something wrong. If it sounds crazy, trust me, I feel crazy now. A few weeks later I started getting flashbacks and having extreme dissociation and anxiety. My friend said she thought I had PTSD. Shortly after that when researching PTSD I came across rape trauma syndrome and realized I had almost all the symptoms. That‚Äôs how I put together that he had assaulted me. I continued to get back pieces of the memory and I can put it all together now. It took about two months.

Anyway all that to say, it‚Äôs very normal to do these things and then look back and realize they don‚Äôt make sense. They are a trauma coping mechanisms, and they aren‚Äôt conscious. We are compelled to do it. I hate myself for contacting him too. Not only was it totally opposite of what happened and undermining myself, but it was retraumatizing to have contacted him once I put the memory together and accepted what had happened (which was later).",1,,2024-12-25 01:54:39,t3_1hl9q1n,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hl9q1n/please_help_me/m3ohpl9/

1hlsrzc,post,(Graphic Warning) I just need answers please. ,"Hello everyone this is my first post here, Honestly I'm shaking as I write this because it just hurts.
From three to thirteen my mom was doing these ""checks"" I mean I consented cause I said yes but it just felt so wrong in a way, It still feels wrong. Anytime I tried to say no she would scream at me, Throw things at me sometimes or smack me. I remember one night when she had me pinned against the bed with her arm on my neck and just pulled down my pants herself, I said yes so many other times so I don't know if it's assault. During the ""checks"" she would take off my pants and look at me [down there] and used her hand to search around at the surface level (I don't really want to put any details right now since it makes me feel scared) , It was always late at night or while my other family members were away. It didn't feel right but like I said yes when she told me. It feels so wrong but I don't know if it counts since I said yes??? I'm sorry if I wasn't very detailed and I'll answer any questions you guys want. 
Also please excuse my formatting and wording, I'm really nervous writing this so I just didn't know what to say.

1hlui7b,post,Is this assault?,"Is this at least assault?

So I‚Äôm an 18 year old bisexual (pretty much lesbian) female. When I turned 18 I finally downloaded tinder. After a few months of having it I matched with this girl. We start talking and I plan this cute night for us at my dorm. We hang out and watch a movie in my dorm a night prior then the real date happens. We drink a bit and make out and such and she ends up spending the night. When we wake up, now both completely sober, we start making out again. This time, however, she puts her hand on my neck. I think nothing of it and brush it off because it wasn‚Äôt forceful and I thought she was going a different way with it. But as we continue she puts her hand on my neck again but this time super hard. She keeps it there for way too long and starts choking me. I was so scared I was squirming underneath her and I stopped kissing back but she never stopped. When she finally let go I let out a big gasp of air and she dove straight into BITING, no not like a hickey, BITING my neck. So like no questions if that was okay or not after.

As I sit on this encounter I realize how much i feared for my life in that moment. It was scary because I had just met her and we definitely did not have the trust to do this. She never asked if it was okay or if I like it. Also I was not reciprocating the violence she was giving towards me at all btw. I was so scared and now anything sexual seems so unappealing to me. Was this assault in the least?

I don't know if I should be writing this here but I'm been feeling trapped for so long. I can't access therapy easily and I'm not brave enough to tell this to my friends. I don't even know if anyone will read this but here it goes. I'm 19 and my partner is 23, he was the first person I've ever dated and I was pretty excited to finally have someone to ""do it"", but when we were discussing where and when it was going to happen I noticed for some reason i was feeling a lot of fear and didn't really wanted to do it anymore and my partner notice this and at first they were okay with it but as time went on they became frustrated with my excuses to not have sex and at the same time I started experiencing really graffic rape nightmares to the point where nowadays they somehow became more and more violent, I know they are just dreams but it really hurt. My partner started to put a lot of pressure on me and implying that if we didn't do it our relationship will start to get worse and worse. So after a lot of begging I said yes, but before we were about to do it I got really nervous and started crying and sayed I didn't wanted to do it but they still insist so I just.. Froze and let it happened it really hurt and I developed a lot of trauma with male friends trying to touch me, even if it's just a hug and I also don't feel comfortable with my partner touching me...
¬øWas this rape?, ¬øcould it been an accident? I feel like I really want to stay with them. But at the same time I hate what they did to me idk what to do now.. I would like to hear other people's opinions on this topic :(",3,4.0,2024-12-25 05:32:51,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hlulhl/please_dont_skip_i_dont_know_what_to_do/

1hlvgc4,post,I‚Äôm pregnant. ,"I told the guy we‚Äôre not having sex until we get condoms because he conveniently ‚Äúforgot‚Äù to bring some. He proceeded to initiate sex‚Ä¶even when I pushed him away and said no, not until we get condoms. He said ok ok. But still continued. Then, I was firm and told him he has to pull out. It was questionable if he did in time, but he kept saying he‚Äôs absolutely sure he did. There is 100% no chance of me getting pregnant. 

Well, it‚Äôs Christmas morning where I am, and the pregnancy test says I am. 

He did something else during sex that was very much non consensual and violating‚Ä¶ 
But was this sexual assault if he coerced me to have unprotected sex even when I said no and finished inside of me when I said not to and then gaslighted me into thinking he did pull out?

(Btw, he ended up being crazy and stalking me and reaching out to me on every communication platform after I wanted to never see him again after that night, so he‚Äôs blocked everywhere.)",23,5.0,2024-12-25 06:36:41,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hlvgc4/im_pregnant/

1hlvy5j,post,"I'm petrified after being touched inappropriately by my driving instructor, but maybe I'm just overreacting?","I'm sorry if this comes off as annoying, it's just that I'm pretty emotional after what happened. So here it goes:
I turned 18 this year's September and I've also been learning the basic of how to drive and trying to get a driving license ever since late September. The instructor, (in his late 40s to early 50s, maybe? I've never cared that deep about him to try to know more), was recommended to my mom by my aunt, who also learned under him before. So my mom got him to be my instructor. He was basically those creepy uncles who gave gross comments on girl's bodies and touched inappropriately while masked it as just ""accidental"". He'd glaze his hand over my chest, even grabbed my boob in some occasions, thinking I wouldn't notice he was being a disgusting individual.  But I did notice, trying to use my arms to kinda like shield over my upper body so he wouldn't touch me while trying to look as nonchalant as possible (since I was too afraid to make a scene). One time, I wore a blouse with one top button undone (because else it would strangle my neck), covering everything and all. Then the instructor feigned compliment on my blouse, use one finger to cling at the collar, and kinda pushed it to the left so he could see the inside of the blouse. I think you know what that is.

I didn't wanna get into trouble with him, because first, he's my mom's acquaintance in some way, so I might come off as sounding bizarre to her (and she might just think I'm making excuses to not having to take any driving lessons). And second, I was scared that I was just being ""dramatic""(in Vietnam, those inappropriate harassments are often glazed over as just ""affection""). So I didn't dare to say anything, even though I wanted to. But today, I just couldn't take it anymore.

So after I got back from the lesson (which my instructor touched me yet again), I kinda had a breakdown in front of my older brother (who is the best human being ever) while recounting all of it for the first time. He was stunned. He then absolutely insisted that I told mom, but never dad (my dad never agreed to let me get driving lessons in the first place, it was my mom's idea. If my dad knew, all hell would break loose). After more crying, I called my mom. At first, I  just told her that the lesson went great. Then I told her if we could talk privately when she came back home tonight. My mom (being the straightforward person she is), just told me to tell her right through the phone. After around 3 back and forth of ""no, Mom, I'll talk to you tonight"" and ""just told me, Nga (my name)"", I cried again. Sobbing

My mom was instantly alerted. She told me to text her. And it went like this:

Me : Mom, this is relating to my instructor. It's kinda hard to say, so we'll talk tonight, okay?
Mom: what happened? Did he harass you?

Holy hell, my mom is a badass. And I cried even more, telling her everything with my brother patting my back to stop me from hyperventilating. And my mom went full blown ballistic, saying she'd ""handle"" it, and told me not to say this to my dad. Minutes later, my instructor called, saying that I had misunderstood him and that he was just being affectionate, saying me like a daughter and all that. He told me to make things clear to my mom, and not to blow this out of proportion. After that, my mom called again, sounding absolutely pissed, with her closed colleagues (who are basically family to her) in the background also going crazy. She told me to block ""that piece of sh*t"" and that I don't need to think much of scum like that. 

It was a relief, to say the least. Yet a small part of me thought that maybe, just maybe, I had overreacted, and had caused a rift and some problems with my instructor-who could make it hard for me to get my license. 

Was I right for reacting like I did? Or did I just think too much? Some advices will be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for reading.

1hlvyhv,post,Do any other girls feel bad for their rapists?,"I tried posting my story but it didn‚Äôt go through or maybe they have to review it first.  This happened to me last week tho at a house Xmas party and I need some advice or to know if I‚Äôm crazy for feeling this way.  I‚Äôm posting on an alt since all my friends know my main. 

And I know this probably sounds crazy. You‚Äôre not supposed to feel like this for having your body used by some drunk a-holes at a party  

I do tho!¬†¬†

I don‚Äôt want to mess up their lives over some sex they wanted.¬†It feels weirdly flattering they wanted my body so bad

 they would actually risk getting in so much trouble for doing it.¬†¬†Which doesn‚Äôt make sense, but I just don‚Äôt feel angry about it.¬†¬†Just kind of bad for them.¬†

I know I‚Äôm supposed to feel really traumad and I don‚Äôt.¬†

Maybe I feel bad because I was kind of messing with them before? ¬†I was calling them geek squad and like ‚Äúoh you wish you could get with me‚Äù kinds of stuff at the party before they did it.¬†

I had to go use the bathroom on the third floor and I think one of them followed me.¬†¬†He and another one of them were waiting for me and kind of pushed me into one of the bedrooms where they did it. I was pretty trashed tho so it‚Äôs hard for me to remember a lot.¬†¬†More like images in my head.¬†

I don‚Äôt know how they told the other guys tho.¬† I don‚Äôt know how much I have to say to describe it here but it feels pretty embarrassing and I don‚Äôt think I can go into a lot of it in this post.¬†

I don‚Äôt know if other girls have ever felt this way but it would help me a lot to know or talk to you if this is a thing and not just me.¬†",25,13.0,2024-12-25 07:14:51,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hlvyhv/do_any_other_girls_feel_bad_for_their_rapists/

I‚Äôm a 14f and recently I been having a lot of flashbacks and memories and I feel like I‚Äôm re living a lot of things that happed to me. 
Between 9-13 he would touch my breasts and butt. The first time it happened it was confusing but I thought it was an accident but I realized it wasn‚Äôt cus he kept doing it. There was other things that happened but I don‚Äôt know if it was sa. 

One time I was on the bed and he was drunk (he mostly did the things when he was drunk but in some instances he wasn‚Äôt drunk) so I was in the bed and he comes into my moms room and I was there with my sis. so he‚Äôs enters and he went there to get something‚Äôs but when he‚Äôs going out he stops at my moms bed where I was lying on and touches my crotch area and when he leaves he‚Äôs GIVIN me A SMIRK I was so confused and scared I couldn‚Äôt believe that he would go to that extent. This was the first time he did that but there was a time where I was in my room and he came to check up on me and when I was sick im my room he sat on a chair I had and started checking my forehead to see if I had a fever but I was noticing that his other had was on my thigh I was very confused and I couldn‚Äôt believe it cus yeah before all that with the touching of the thighs and him touching my crotch he would mostly touch my breasts a lot. 


I remember a time where he would always get behind me and grab my neck and he would push his body against mine so I could feel his penis and he would always laugh and do this every single time I was standing he would grab my neck very hard and it was hard to get out of his hands but he would always stop doing it when my mom would come. THERES was a thing I overheard that he had naked pictures of me but idk if that‚Äôs true all of this has stopped when I turned 14 but I always felt like it was my fault and idk how it happened if I always tried being carful there are times where I can‚Äôt even get up and do anything because it makes me so depressed and also I‚Äôm scared of touch and people comforting me. 


I‚Äôve had told my mom and I confronted my stepdad but he denied it all so idk if whatever I felt and lived is just a fake alarm I know I got touched  but he makes me feel like it didn‚Äôt even happen. There‚Äôs been more things but this stick a lil bit in my mind and I have told my mom and it‚Äôs been had for her and she keeps me away from him and she can‚Äôt leave him cus she doesn‚Äôt have no where else to go and also I‚Äôve told her that this might have been an misunderstanding or accident so she doesn‚Äôt think much of and it hasn‚Äôt happened in a year or possibly 1 1/2 years  im sorry if it truly doesn‚Äôt makes sense.

Answering the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù would be admitting to parts of himself he never wants to know or confront, I suspect.

Thanks for sharing this. I know my assaulter doesn‚Äôt think he did anything wrong (which I assume is most rapists‚Äô viewpoint). He was 17 and I don‚Äôt want to give him any excuses because he still should have known. It was his responsibility. But I think he -tragically- really didn‚Äôt. He was extremely impulsive, self-absorbed, reckless, no empathy, delinquent, etc etc. He checks all the boxes for a rapist mentality. But I never said no, I just froze and couldn‚Äôt speak.

m3py6df,comment,,"Hi, you aren't being overdramatic at all. He is seriously creepy and awful and has sexually assaulted you multiple times. Touching your body and your breasts wasn't an 'accident': it was deliberate. Trust your gut. I can confidently say as someone who has had 2 driving instructors so far (I'm a shit driver lol), neither of them have ever, EVER had any cause to touch me in any way. Furthermore, me and my family and friends are all very 'affectionate', in that we hug a lot. Never, ever during my time hugging my friends/family have my hands ever 'accidentally' strayed to a breast. I think my friend once accidentally touched my boob (she brushed past me), and instantly yanked her hand away and apologised to me sincerely - so clearly an accident. In comparison, this guy has deliberately touched you multiple times, with obvious intention. 

He's a disgusting, predatory creep. He's lying to you and trying to gaslight you into thinking you're in the wrong, because he wants to keep harassing you and other young women.",1,,2024-12-25 10:45:55,t3_1hlvy5j,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hlvy5j/im_petrified_after_being_touched_inappropriately/m3py6df/

m3pyu4e,comment,,"The reason you feel violated is because you were violated. 

1. She touched you in your sleep. Asleep people cannot consent - she didn't give you the opportunity to say 'yes' or 'no', she just took from you. 

2. She had already assaulted you at this point, but it gets worse after you told her explicitly to stop. It doesn't matter how you told her - e.g. if you told her really gently and sweetly, it's still a 'no' and it still counts. Obviously touching in sleep is never ok, but you saying 'no' adds a vocal component to this she decided to override. 

She is wrong here, she is a rapist, and you are allowed to feel upset and angry with her. The onus wasn't on you to 'advocate' for yourself more: the onus was on her to respect your consent. As your girlfriend, she should have cared about your feelings, and she should have cared that you didn't want to do something. I'll give you an example: with my ex, there were certain things I couldn't do in sex because of my SA, because they triggered me too much. Even though my ex really wanted to do that stuff with me, they didn't and they never forced me to because they cared about me, and their love and care for me mattered more than the sex. The same should have been true for you and your girlfriend. You're not exaggerating and you're not making her into the bad guy: you're simply telling the truth, and in the truth she looks bad because she acted badly.",1,,2024-12-25 10:54:05,t3_1hln4m9,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hln4m9/i_feel_violated_by_my_ex_gf_but_its_my_own_fault/m3pyu4e/

m3qhqiq,comment,,"You aren't disgusting. I myself deal with this shit everyday. Since I lived the majority of my childhood this way, it actually became one of my bad coping ways that I need to deal with. As children we don't know what to do and we are weak. We just want to live. But later our way of surviving ends up as a chain in our minds. Try to always critically think about what happened to you, and whether you really want it or whether you're just afraid to say ""no"" because of potential consequences, like them gaining reasons to abuse you more. We are afraid that it can happen again and we will lose control, so we sometimes idealize being submissive to fool ourselves that it's fine. It's really the helplessness, deafeatism, pain, and the self-care that's targeted badly that makes us fall into this stuff. Sometimes we submit to the fears because we're afraid that we may lose against them.

Do not go against yourself, that's partly why it continues. Realize that you were a victim and now though it is hard you can fight it. One of the things that could help you would be to stop being dependent on the abusers. Another thing that you could do would be to get better at things that could potentially save you in such a situation, like physical self-defence. Believe me, this is not the time for being your own abuser. This is the time to get free from the chain of submission and become stronger than ever. You already have enough strength to talk about it, notice that.

So, you accept the pro-capitalistic notion of making the sex a new drug to sell to the lonely, traumatized and insecure, the glorification of the sexual objectification, and you're trying to sell to people the idea that it's something great... Sexuality is fine, oversexualization is a problem.

Let's take for example a feet ""mistress"". If someone would cut their feet off their whole attention would be gone. Who would be there to give a shit? What's good about it? Becoming dumber than ever? If you go with the flow of objectification, you eventually become an object in other people's eyes.

Unpopular opinion here, coming from a male who was assaulted at a young age‚Ä¶ pulling out is not birth control and you can‚Äôt rely on a man pulling out on time even if he really intends to. Not only can you get pregnant from pre-ejaculate, but it puts a lot of pressure on a man to control his ejaculation. It‚Äôs not like trying to hold your pee, sometimes it just happens without expecting it. I see a lot of posts in these subs where people agree on pulling out and it fails, either intentionally or unintentionally. We‚Äôre human so we have sex for pleasure, but we‚Äôre also animals so we have sex for mating. If we‚Äôre with someone who we‚Äôre not ready to get pregnant with, then we shouldn‚Äôt be using pulling out as birth control.",3,,2024-12-25 15:37:08,t3_1hlvgc4,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hlvgc4/im_pregnant/m3qtf8y/

(Im sorry if it's not allowed to post something like this, please remove my post if so.)

I wonder if im the only one who, after the sexual assault, has developped self-destructive comportments such as self-harm or trying to make friends go away (basically isolating oneself) or feeling lost completely.

I just need to know if it's related to this trauma or my other traumas (üò¢) or maybe all of them.

It was always uncomfortable to watch him grow into what is basically a child that can't function alone from a capable independent man.

Then he stroked over my butt slowly, and I was frozen in shock. I've went through a lot of SA in my life so this was triggering already but then he dug his fingers around one of my butt cheeks and dug into it , like super deeply and it actually hurt. I was tearing up, and then he stroked over it again and slapped my butt hard. I told my mom that I don't like him and that he made me uncomfortable as hell, but she was like 'oh he's just like that' ?? I'm really doubting myself here.

1hm6y7b,post,My body holds trauma ,"Evry time when I try to do core exercise by contracting my stomach I cannot stop thinking about the power struggle I had when I was getting assaulted by the assailant. I forcefully pushed his hands away from my stomach and groin area while he was trying to resist my strength and keep pushing hands towards my body to harass me. I cant not think about the sensation and feeling when I was physically fighting off his hand with my own strength. so whenver I constrict my stomach muscles or any part of my muscles, I get triggered and reminded of the moment I was assaulted. What he did was unforgivable and repulsive and horrifying. I will not tolerate anyone touch my body without my consent or make me feel out of control again. I will NEVER let anyone take that control and autonomy away from me again. I jsut felt so out of control when I try to exercise and get really frustrated and angry. its exhausting to keep reminding myself that im not in danger anymore.   it was repulsive and extremely upsetting to think about the moment. I cant even look at my own stomach or body when I do certain excersicese nad it really frustrates me and makes me deranged. I just want to scream but im scared to express my anger or someone hears me and call cops on me. im scared that expressing my anger will lead to mental break down or losing my control. Have you experienced not being able to move your body in certain way or have trouble with exercises after SA? What helped you to feel more control in your body without getting flashback of the memories or sensation? Do you just try to ignore the thoughts in the moment? but my body sensation keep telling me otherwise..

Im really worried about my future and If I have to keep torturing myself in the present moment, is it even worth reporting?

1hm7r6z,post,It totally feels like my fault,"The first time it actually happened (after many attempts from many guys) was 2 years ago. A stranger broke into my house, took me the whole prosecution time to heal, sort of, and luckily he‚Äôs serving 20 years now.

It happened again, not a total stranger, but a French guy I met at a thanksgiving dinner party. We walked into each other at a coffeehouse, since I don‚Äôt live in the same city as him chances were really slim, and this time we did share our contacts.
He invited me to his house, but I told him I rather a more neutral place that wasn‚Äôt his house since I didn‚Äôt know him, he said we could meet in his building common area and I agreed, but I got there too late and it was already closed. I just came from watching a ballet with my girl friends, so I felt cheery and didn‚Äôt pay too much mind to going up to his place, he did tell me in case I didn‚Äôt agree, but I did, and the more I think about it, it feels more like my fault.

We went up and everything was fine, we liked each other even more. I consented, but during s*x. 

(Tw ‚ö†Ô∏è I‚Äôm going to be a little more graphic from here, if you don‚Äôt feel like reading)

I told him he could be rougher, what came next was just NOT what I meant and I kept asking him to stop, I kept crying and screaming and telling him I didn‚Äôt mean it like that, for a moment his arms were crushing my throat and I could barely talk or breathe. It lasted a good minute until I grabbed his arm and bit him, then he stopped and asked me if I was for real?

My girl friends knew I was going to his apartment and asked me how everything went, and I didn‚Äôt dare to tell them I just told them it was ok. 
He drove me home, and we haven‚Äôt speak since then.
I spent 2 days crying and feeling sad, but now it‚Äôs just so weird what I‚Äôm feeling, it‚Äôs almost as if my brain absorbed it, I‚Äôm so confused and honestly don‚Äôt know how to feel. 
I‚Äôm not prosecuting, I feel there‚Äôs too many elements where it is my fault, there‚Äôs a language barrier, although he‚Äôs French but speaks Spanish very well (my mother-tongue), and also this guy is ridiculously rich.

It hasn‚Äôt been a week yet, and no one knows.",9,2.0,2024-12-25 19:58:20,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hm7r6z/it_totally_feels_like_my_fault/

It took months for me to uncover the memory and then ago it two more months to put it all together. I went through rape trauma syndrome and everything. The assault was 18 years ago.

He rented a storage unit from my parents storage business this summer which is why I saw him. His unit is right by the door to my childhood home.

It's not relevant but I wanted to say this. I understand the appeal of drugs when you have trauma - I was an opiate addict for 7 years, since I was 15, but it's worse for you in the long term, hun. Quitting is one of the only good decisions I ever made in my life.

1hm9zun,post,Still blame myself,"Idk what flair to give this or what to call it tbh. This happened when I was 17, so a minor in some countries but not mine. Forgive me if I was supposed to tag this as happening to a minor. 

Guess I just want to get it off my chest, really. It still really fuckin bothers me for some reason, even though it was years ago. I was drugged, though not really, because it was absinthe, which isn't really a drug I don't think. I don't really know what it is, just that the guy told me he had it before it happened and it's some sort of really strong alcohol that's illegal here. I don't remember that much of it. I was dared to drink a mix of everything at the table, then the host went inside with my drink for a while, and I drank it. All I remember after that is feeling really weak and really, really scared with the host touching me and making me touch him. I didn't really fight and there was someone else in the room at the time. Makes me think I wasn't fighting hard enough and it was all my fault. I just let it happen. Surely if I wasn't consenting hard enough the other man would've helped me, right? I was also the victim everyone victim blames, getting drunk in a skimpy outfit at a teen party. I remember saying goodbye to my best friend then... I don't know. I never told anyone because I blamed myself and I was ashamed. Plus I'm used to the police not doing shit. I took a shower and cried instead. Then I forgot for two years.

Now I remember and every damn time I remember it I just- I think it's all my fault. If I didn't want it to happen I should've done something or told someone, right? But I didn't do a fuckin thing and it haunts me.",4,7.0,2024-12-25 21:58:25,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hm9zun/still_blame_myself/

1hma1m4,post,What does this count as.,"I'm 18, female. This happened last night. Christmas eve. My uncle was over with his kids. Alcohol was brought up and I mentioned my long distance partner periodically drinks. He handed me his flask to ""put me off alcohol."" Said I wouldn't want more, the taste would disgust me. I tried it. It was strong, but I didn't expect alcohol to be pleasant so I didn't react much. Liked how it burned on the way down, even. Later we were alone again and he handed me the flask. Again. Again. Again. Again. I dont know how much I had, I felt fine, and he brought more. Lighter stuff, a modelo. He had 2, I had one, but the whiskey was starting to kick in really hard around halfway through. Boundaries and guard dropped, we were talking about how we were best friends when I was tiny. I can't remember those times. I remember missing him when he left though, moved out. Point is we started getting touchy, but I swear it wasn't sexual, I swear I didn't make moves. I couldn't walk straight at this point and I was swaying even when I sat. He kept making odd comments I couldn't understand about hormones and the alcohol, I said I didn't understand, he would say I'm pretty, etc etc. We were sitting on bar stools in the kitchen, the swivel ones, so he swivels me towards him and lifts my leg over his and pulls me up into his lap. Cuddling, I was straddling him. Then he started getting touchy. Really touchy, his hand went under my shirt and he started toying with my chest, and he just keeps apologizing the whole time, ""I'm sorry, I lost my head there,"" but he's not stopping and I'm just frozen. Shaking, he could probably feel me shaking, I mean like a leaf. And he finally pulls away and he lifts my head and I think it's dine, I think he's going to stop, but then he's kissing me and I'm not reciprocating but he keeps going until I finally unfreeze and pull away. I said I should go to bed and he agrees. I managed to stumble my way upstairs. Slept with a pair of scissors. He's still here. He visits often. I trusted him so much. He said I'm like a daughter to him, I said I wished he was my dad and then that happened and I feel so so disgusting.

m3si020,comment,,"hugs

your post rang a bell because I had felt this a long time ago but I couldnt explain it and i ""forgot"" because my family was the same way. so this stuff i learned from abusive partners i somewhat kept playing into for survival because I was not ever able to say no growing up

I remember after SA I was so angry because everyone around me asked me why I ""let it happen"" ""if they were really was as bad as i said they were"" but that missed the point on so many levels, and also *I had* told them no repeatedly, many many times, and in many different ways (verbally, nonverbally, with averted gaze, reluctant words) they bypassed all the signs someone else would catch.

I was never taught what to do around people when they  arent respecting you. I wasnt raised with my boundaries or my power acknowledged or respected. I wasn't even telling myself they werent listening, I was just like what dont they understand. because manipulative people will half-listen just to buy themselves more time. I fell into the trap of overexplaining because they would pretend to listen sometimes, but really they didn't care about respecting or valuing me, just exploiting me however far they could ""get away"" with. and my therapists told me to communicate if I was having issues. no. that was all a lie. they were abusing their power over others and they knew it. that's why it wasn't my fault. their treatment made it conditional though and they reward/punish the behaviors they want which is actually abuse. that's why it's powerful to say no *now* without any explanations and sticking to it.

it's conditional treatment and I was raised with parents who did this. I had to answer every question they asked. I knew I had to do anything they ""asked"" which is actually an expectation and a demand, because they didnt safely give the option of no. I would feel guilty for putting myself first (instead of being encouraged and still treated with respect, like in a healthy dynamic). instead I was punished for protecting myself, being told i was sensitive or unfair or withdrawing or not helping and reminded of how much I cost them (guilt-tripping). it was a lie that my existence was a burden, which distracted from the reality that they actually they were being abusive.

I set boundaries and said no and I was rejected by my family. they made threats and cut me off and spread lies about me. that's why I didn't say no all those years, I had to play by their rules because I needed a place to live and food to eat. they set those rules and that's not fair. im not angry at myself any more but im angry if they keep abusing that over people",2,,2024-12-25 22:03:32,t1_m38xtcs,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hj0go9/being_trained_to_not_say_no/m3si020/

Breath control, form, and (in the case of skeet shooting) reflexes, all come together to help.

1hmc7qf,post,I remember nothing and don't feel valid calling it an assault,"Apologies for the long explanation, this is my first time typing this out semi coherently.

I was in Germany a few weeks ago with my at the time boyfriend. We were both 19 and abroad together without our families for the first time. I trusted him to look after me and care for me and thought he was a genuine loving person. 
We decided on our second night there to have a couple of drinks in the bar at the hotel we were staying. I had previously come down to the bar to ask for a bottle opener as we had a beer each with our food in the room. I noticed a barman around our age or a bit older staring at me but thought nothing of it. We came down after food and asked for a vodka cranberry each, noting the barman that was staring was extra kind and accommodating offering to bring it down to us. Noticed and my boyfriend said aswell; the drinks tasted extra strong almost as if half vodka, and he said they might take less care in measuring where we were. We continued to sit in the lobby seating area by the bar and had maybe 3 drinks each before moving to sit at the bar as instructed by the barman and bartender. Each drink was brought to us without us asking and tasted as strong, when we sat at the bar we were given shots without request and the bartender took a shot with us. The barman had been acting very friendly towards me greeting me earlier showing an interest in chatting to me when we sat at the bar. Me and my boyfriend talked to the 2 of them and its hazy from there but I remember going to the bathroom and I have a flash of the barman who served us walking directly towards me while i was standing outside the women's bathroom, getting close to me and my memory is black from there.

I woke up in a hospital hallway the next morning completely confused and panicked. From what I remember the nurses tried to calm me once they realised I was awake and tell me what had happened. Apparently I was found in the bathroom after my boyfriend noticed I'd been gone a long time and wondering where I was and went looking. I was in distress crying on the floor saying I had been raped by the barman. My boyfriend called the police who sent an ambulance and I was brought in and treated for alcohol intoxication. I was told by my family members when my boyfriend called them on the phone to tell them what happened as I was being brought in the ambulance they could hear me howling crying and shouting in an absolute state of fear panick and confusion.
 I was treated in the hospital and police who were investigating showed my boyfriend footage of me and the barman kissing outside the bathroom and entering together in his words. My boyfriend called me while i was in hospital saying I had fucked up and gotten the guy fired by saying he had raped me. I had bruises on my hips scratches on my back and a large graze on my lower back. That morning was the most confusing upsetting time of my life as I woke up in a foreign hospital with people speaking German which I couldn't understand. I wanted my mother and to go home, I was scared. When the hospital staff asked me if I wanted to do a rape kit I was in a state of complete panic, confusion guilt and fear at what had happened to me (I regret this now, but i refused). My boyfriend came to the hospital and we got a taxi back to the hotel, I was sedated and felt the worst I had ever felt in my life. He was telling me how disgusting I was and asking me why I did it and what was wrong with me (he did this all day until my family arrived), lying and telling me the hotel had kicked me out. The reality was in his mind I cheated on him and lied about it, he told his family this and his sister dm'd me on Instagram saying I was throwing around crazy accusations and to stay away from her brother. When we got back to the hotel and I lay in bed he was interrogating me calling me a wh*re, a tr*mp and a crazy b*tch asking me why I ruined our relationship. He had his family on speakerphone in the bed next to me was keeping me awake on purpose so I would hear them call me a dirty b*tch, saying there was something wrong with me and they would ""F*ck me up"". He rejected me saying I remembered nothing saying i was looking for an excuse to cheat on him and I was flirting with the barman.

Later found out he was withholding information from my mother and family on the phone about what was happening while I was being put into the ambulance, worrying her by not giving her the police contact information. He made the hospital staff think he would take care of me and make sure I was safe and fit to be discharged, only to actively torment me as soon as we were alone. To be honest I really don't think I was in a state to consent to anything with the fact that I blacked out and had only had 3 and a half drinks and 1 shot, maybe suggesting those drinks were stronger than normal. Its not as if I had never drank vodka before I had never fully blacked out. The hotel compensated us for the rooms which we split the cost of but he kept all the money from the refund. The barman was fired and the director of the hotel apologised to my mother and aunt when they arrived. My boyfriend had me thinking they were kicking me out for ""puking all over the lobby"" and were going to charge cleaning fees. To top it all off I don't remember any of what happened me after I was sitting at the bar except that flash of the barman getting close outside the bathroom but I really don't think i would have lied and said I had been raped if thats not what I thought happened. I said this supposedly after I had been found on the floor in a state where i was too drunk to stand. The thing is I really don't know and can only count on other peoples word.
Sorry for the long post I'm sure it's a mess and I left things out but I would at least like to hear someone else's perspective on my situation that isn't my mother or a Crisis Councillor or nurse.",3,2.0,2024-12-26 00:01:02,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hmc7qf/i_remember_nothing_and_dont_feel_valid_calling_it/

1hmedd7,post,Realization TW,"Hi everybody, just to preface this, I am in no trouble anymore! This is a situation from long ago and I‚Äôve just been coming to terms with what happened to me

When I was 16 I was heavily suicidal, and drank my way out of it. This was not the right thing to do, but at the time I just wanted to die and I thought it would hurry that process along. In the years before hand I had never really experienced physical affection aside from one girl in my life before. She was the only person to ever by attracted to me and my thinking was that in what little life I had left, it was my only chance at feeling any sense of affection. So I let her touch me and kiss me though it made me deeply uncomfortable. I didn‚Äôt want it but in my head I needed it(I understand this is backwards) when I started drinking I became even more depressed and lonely, a combination of the alcohol and meds, with the fact it would be late into the night. Though I do not remember the specifics, Ik I reached out to the girl mentioned before hand, and though it never got literally physical (as I could never bring myself to do it) I let her see etc much more than I would‚Äôve liked or wanted

This is NOT her fault. Though I was drunk and very easily taken advantage of, I do acknowledge I was consenting though what capacity I had to do so is in question. This is what made it so hard for me to categorize before because A)it was only ever virtual and B) I was never forced to do it. After discussing it with a friend lately, I have just come to think I was assaulted in some way. It has affected my life in more ways than I knew. I can‚Äôt bare to see people in nude as it makes me remember how much I didn‚Äôt want to be seen like that. I can‚Äôt handle physical touch because it reminds me of what it felt like (not that it was bad physically but because I associate those feelings with being taken advantage of) 

You all are such strong people, and I rlly do want to acknowledge how at least to me, what I went through was much more minor or at the very least not cut and dry. What I mean to say is don‚Äôt hesitate to push back on if this is assault or not, I value your opinion and would like it to be heard! 

I‚Äôm sorry ik this is a lot but it‚Äôs been a real big hit to my psyche and I just wanted to voice it. I would really appreciate any type of feedback or support though it‚Äôs not required!

1hmflnz,post,he gave me Lego flowers as an apology for assaulting me,"every time I see Lego flowers, either the ones own or online or at the store, I remember this. October 14th 2023. it wasn't even the worst of the assaults physically but it was emotionally. up to that point, I would say no and he wouldn't listen so I'd just go quiet and let him do what he wanted. but that night I had decided I wouldn't stop protesting. I was determined that if I didn't stop saying no that he would eventually listen. but that night I learned my no meant NOTHING to him. he kept grabbing me and touching me as I cried and didn't stop until I was sobbing and he finally asked ""what's wrong?"" I told him ""I didn't want that to happen"". he started to defend himself and then he apologized. I couldn't decide if I wanted to cry in his arms or never to see him again. and those strong emotions went on for a couple days where I didn't really feel comfortable around him and I desperately tried to make him understand why what he did was wrong and why it hurt me so much. I thought I got through to him and eventually in October 16th 2023, a package was delivered to my front door. the pink Lego Orchids and a little note that said ""I'm sorry"". I thought he understood. I thought that proved that he understood and was sorry and it meant something. but it didn't because everything only got worse from there. every time I see Lego flowers I'm reminded of all this. I still keep the Orchids in my room as a reminder that no gift can replace an apology and an actual promise to improve. every time I see those Lego flowers I remind myself never to let myself be tricked again. but at the same time, whenever I think of Lego flowers I am rushed with all these memories and emotions.

1hmggcw,post,"my dad who groomed me, dislocated my jaw and sprained (?) my shoulder is getting out of jail soon. scared out whats gonna happen afterwards","
so my dad groomed me and attempted to rape me. i feel stupid bc it was so obvious and when i first came to terms with what was going on i felt so ashamed and that i couldn't speak up because he would definitely say that i wanted it because he was so obvious, but i was a stupid, sheltered kid who was told, every time an adult did something sexual to me that it wasn't a big deal bc it wasn't rape.

it started when i was 16 moving from foster care to my dad/grandma's when on my 16th birthday i went to the back of spencers to buy a toy and i thought that adults werent privy to what's in the back of spencer's. my dad asked me what i bought and pulled the vibrator out the bag and was talking about it very matter of factly and even explaining to my 11 yr old brother what it was. my mom was super strict and didn't even let me use tampons so i honestly took this as a win and that my dad was like ""the cool dad."" 

when i moved in w him he had to buy me new bras bc i had a weird bra size you could only find online and he asked me to show him my new bra every time he got one for me. i didn't think this was weird bc i walked around in my bra anyway bc my mom/stepdad almost never wore any clothes (my stepdad wore boxers and my mom would be completely naked) and i would wear my underwear around the house too. but the second time my dad asked i started to think it was weird.

side not when i was 8 yrs old my dad was in court for raping a 13 yr old girl. but i didn't have any contact w him so over time i thought my mom was lying abt this bc she was insanely abusive and let her husband and other kids SA me so i thought, theres no way she actually cares abt SA, she just wants to keep me from my dad. but i was still suspicious.

then, every time i ordered a package, he would ask if it was a vibrator and to see it and i didn't rlly even think anything of it especially bc he and the whole family really were rlly open abt sexual stuff and made innuendos and stuff. 

then he started playing this ""titty twister/purple nurple"" game like he would randomly twist my nipples really hard and i asked him to stop and he said ""why? if you can come up with a good reason then ill stop"" and all i could say is ""bc i dont do that to you,"" bc i was uncomfortable addressing how this mightve been sexual. 
He also would disappear in a store then come up behind me (and any other women he was with including his mother) and grab/caress ? our butts and we would think it was a stranger but really it was just him so it was okay ?? no ! i remember thinking ""he still groped us"" ???

when i was 18 is when i started trying to be more private, not showing him my underwear and my vibrators, and i would just buy the stuff w my own credit card without telling him but he would still ask. and i bought my own bra and he made me show it to him on facetime even after i kept saying i didnt want to. then the next time he saw me he ripped the bra off of me and broke it (it was $90) while we were play fighting.

then we all spent christmas with our foster parents and he waited till he was driving me back to college to give me my gift, which was a dildo. i told him i didn't want it and he just gave it to his fiance.

my foster parents ended up sending me back to his/my grandma's house (i moved back w them when i turned 18, they sent me back when i was 19) and he would bust in my room knowing i was changing, rip off my blanket when he knew i'd be barely clothed (i started wearing multiple layers bc of this and he said ""youre starting to get smart"" and cackled like a hyena the first time i did it. 

he bought me a new bra and asked to see it and when i said no he backed me against the wall and said ""girl, i said take off ur shirt""

he's a thief for a living and would drive down from ny to florida stealing from stores to sell the stuff and i went with him, but the van kept breaking down and i went to sleep but as i was waking up i heard him on the phone with his friend and when then when i fully woke up he told me ""my friend want a video of us for $6,000"" i said ""you dont have a video of us ?"" and he said ""no, a video of us having sex"" and i couldn't even say anything like, i just froze and stared out the window. he kept saying ""youre not saying anything, does that mean youre okay with it ? how could you be okay with this, that mf is sick.""
and then after like 30 mins he said ""when we get back to ny im doing crack"" (hes a crackhead btw) and he really did and i had to just stand out there outside the car bc i didn't wanna get hotboxed w crack smoke.

a couple weeks after this he tried to wake me up, but i was already up and was just laying there with my eyes shut, but then he jumped on top of me and had his body fully against mine and his face like in my chest and was like grinding against me. i felt like i left my body and was so scared but i honestly assumed this would happen at some point and got so used to living w the fear of being raped that it was more like an ""i told you so"" moment for myself. then he accidentally kicked over the table at the foot of my bed and my grandma heard and yelled asking what was going on so he got off me and said ""i told you to get up.""

i kinda convinced myself that it wasn't what i thought it was until almost a year later. but before then he punched me in the face and dislocated my jaw and threw me across the room by my arm and in doing that, he shoved my arm so deep into the socket that i think it was sprained or something. i couldn't raise it for like a month. me and my twin sister had to go to a battered womens shelter after that. she wasn't here during the majority of all this, she was still at out foster parents house but she came back to our dad/grandma's house and literally 2 weeks later he beat us up.

now, i told my mom about all this about 2 yrs after the fact, it was right before my 22nd birthday i think. idk why i told her. maybe bc she always downplayed my SA and i thought she'd finally care, bc it seems like she pretty much only cared abt SA, if my dad was the one doing it, and she did care. but last month my dad called her from jail (he's in there for stealing, not for SA or DV or anything) and he said hes getting out soon. im scared my mom is gonna confront him or tell him everything i told her and hes gonna say that i wanted it bc i was too ignorant/naive to realize what was happening for the first half of this bs. 

also, during all this there were a million other allegations i heard abt him and things the he admitted to including, trafficking and murdering ppl. he used to be gang affiliated and A LOT of ppl are scared of him so i believe it. im rlly scared of that too, especially since i have custody of my little brother and he might hurt him too.",1,1.0,2024-12-26 04:07:00,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hmggcw/my_dad_who_groomed_me_dislocated_my_jaw_and/

1hmgn1f,post,Sad about Christmas (vent),"I have been a little down today, it was a bit rough for me. My grandfather is a bad man, and traumatized me horrifically as a child to the point I have trouble with family dynamics. I am usually over talkative to friends but whenever I'm around him or my family it's like I just completely lose my voice. Christmas was like that today, I used basic signs like ""water"" or ""bathroom"" to my dad but being around my grandfather just made me upset. I had trouble speaking at all and just felt really sad.  I watched all my family members all day and couldn't help but think about my trauma and other sad things that have happened. I wanted to outburst at my grandfather or yell at him and today was tough cus there was little kids there, his great grandchildren and he was taking pictures with his camera. And all I wanted to do was smash it and yell at him and thought about how badly i wanted to pull the parents aside and beg them to never leave them alone around him. I just felt so isolated. I was abused sexually by my grandfather but also just horrifically verbally abused by my family. Sorry for venting about underrated things it was just piling up. I hate being around a pedophile but I've spent my whole life being minimized about it that I just sit and let it happen, and it's my fault. I blame myself and talk down to myself like ""you dint deserve to be traumatized, because if your pain was valid you would disown your family "" but I go anyway because moms family disowned me and I cannot cope with not having any family. I feel weak because of it. Sorry, I'm rambling 

Tonight me and Dad went to my apartment, I spent the whole day being silent and being completely ignored by everyone there so I was excited to talk and give dad my christmas gifts I got him. And over and over with my gifts he kept saying he'd give to my grandfather. Several of my gifts are being given to a child molester. Dad saw how ugly it got first hand when I was staying with him and grandparents briefly and the full fledged ptsd nightmare of screaming from stress and crying. I feel so invisible I talk about it openly so he knows and just doesn't fucking care. It felt like a massive slap in the face.  

I thought yesterday I was going to thr storge unit with dad, where all my belongings are because I lost my house I was renting for 7 years this May and hadn't moved pretty much anything. He offered as my Xmas present to go and get some of my belongings. Then he asked me to habd him table in the back ivr had my whole life and he revealed he wanted to give it to my pedo grandfather. I was extremely offended, it wasn't vis to give. He apologized for giving away my stuff but now I realize he only took me to the storage unit to steal my belongings for someone who sexuallg abused me and I'm extremely hurt.

I don't understand why my Dad would do that. It hurts me so bad. I cried right there in front of him tonight and just shut down. Even if my grandfather wasn't a pedophile, he is a bad person. He's extremely racist, and hateful,  and makes violent comments about various family members. He's abusive. I've seen him hit my grandmother and he brags about beating his daughter when she was a teenager and boasts about giving her two black eyes saying he wished he could beat her like that again. As a kid he would say horrific things to me like telling me if I died, I meant so little to everyone that I wouldn't get a funeral and would get thrown into a ditch.

Whenever i beg Dad to listen he never does. He just doesn't care I was molested. He hangs up or walks away, ignores me for days until he thinks I'm over it and refuses to acknowledge the only person he loves is a pedophile. I feel like my voice doesn't even fucking matter. Im.upset dad's Christmas presents are going to my abuser.  My mom is the same way, they worship their parents. It really hurts. My mom won't see me for Christmas for the past few years cus she always choses her mom. 

I wish so badly I could have been born into a family with at least one normal side. Instead of whatever disturbing sexual cult I'm in where it's normal to abuse family members. It hurts so fucking much. I feel like I'm the only one awake and the anger is just overwhelming. 

Sorry I just really needed to confide somewhere.",4,2.0,2024-12-26 04:18:36,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hmgn1f/sad_about_christmas_vent/

I hope you get an apology but I would stop expecting one and just acknowledge that they hurt you and they made that choice to hurt you.

I hate myself for not being able to look at myself positively and not being able to allow myself feel happy.  I feel so embarrassed and unworthy when I look at myself in the mirror. intellectually I know that it wasnt my fault that SA happened to me. but the aftermath crushed my self worth and how I view myself on subconscious level.

1hmhzok,post,i think i might‚Äôve been assaulted when i was young but i don‚Äôt remember,"i read a book recently about someone who worked with rape survivors and ended up questioning whether he was assaulted or not, and that made me start to wonder. i didn‚Äôt pay much attention to it bc i have intrusive thoughts so i have a lot of really weird and random stuff pop into my head, but i just remembered that when i was a few years younger, i had the same question unprompted and now im sort of spiraling.

i can‚Äôt remember anything from my childhood. anything at all. i know some stuff that happened bc my parents told me about it because that‚Äôs about it. i also apparently used to have dreams that i mistook for reality. for example, i was scared of basketball as a kid because i had a dream i was hit in the face with one and thought it was real. 

i looked online for some experiences because i remembered seeing a twitter post about someone who said they thought they‚Äôd been sa‚Äôd as a child bit couldn‚Äôt remember the details, but they felt it in their bones. i saw a lot of other sa survivors said that it was completely possible that they were sa‚Äôd and didn‚Äôt remember.  i remembered seeing this twitter post after i remembered questioning it when i was younger, but these were separate instances.

i believe the first time i wondered it was after i learned what sa was. i was in my room in the dark and i thought ‚Äúmaybe i was sa‚Äôd before‚Äù and then had a really vivid thought of my dad coming into my room at night and sa‚Äôing me while i was asleep. but i loved my dad and felt ashamed of thinking about it, so i tried to forget and eventually did until now. i must‚Äôve been around 10 or 11.

i also hate being touched. i‚Äôve always, always despised it for as long as i can remember. there were four people i am or was completely ok with hugging. my childhood best friends (two of them), my older sister, and my girlfriend. all of them are women. there was one other person i was ok with hugging, that was one of my scout troops‚Äô older sisters. i felt super safe with her and she was always super nice to me, and i always felt so drawn to her. im pretty sure she was my first crush. but later on i found out she was a survivor and now that im thinking about it, im wondering if i was sa‚Äôd and maybe we were drawn together because of that? like, we could tell even without saying or me remembering anything and became close because of that. it makes me feel like my skin is on fire and i need to rip it off, but i always thought it was just sensory issues. i don‚Äôt remember when i started to hate being touched, but i don‚Äôt think i was always like that.

i‚Äôve also always been really drawn to the experience of sa survivors. i read as many books on it as i could find and just felt a strong drive and connection to the stories of survivors, even before the first traumatic event that i can actually remember happened. it always connected to me deep in my soul, the way other traumatic experiences that i haven‚Äôt personally lived through didn‚Äôt. when reading about physical abuse, i didn‚Äôt have that connection to it. but when i research sexual abuse i feel like i‚Äôve finally discovered something that i‚Äôve been looking for for my whole life. i write about sa a lot too, and i write a lot of characters that are sa survivors. i always get more attached to them than i do the others, which is also true of sa survivors in popular media. 

i also had like a really dramatic shift in personality as i grew older. like, really dramatic. i used to be super bubbly and excitable and i loved to talk to people and do things, but as i started to get older i changed completely. i‚Äôm super depressed and i rarely get excited about anything and i despise talking to people. my entire personality and way of thinking changed. i‚Äôm not emotional anymore, i only think logically. i used to be super empathetic, but as i got older, it just‚Ä¶disappeared. i can barely feel empathy anymore. i don‚Äôt even remember when this change started to happen, and this could be because of anything, but now im overthinking it.

before i only thought about my dad, but now im thinking about maybe someone at the daycare i went to for a little while or maybe a teacher at school. i remember i had a few really creepy teachers, and one of them was my one on one resource teacher. the same research teacher was also having an affair with one of my other teachers. the gym teacher was also rumored to look up girls‚Äô skirts when they were stretching. for the daycare, i don‚Äôt remember anything from that at all, but my mom tells me i had a really terrible time there. she also once told me about a boy my age who grabbed onto my arm and pulled and wouldn‚Äôt let go, even when i screamed. she said that none of the employees paid any attention to me even though i was screaming my head off. she removed me from daycare after that and never sent me to another one. she saw that when she went to pick me up. she later told me that she wonders how many times that little boy did that to me and nobody noticed, which is now making me wonder‚Ä¶if anyone sa‚Äôd kids there, would they have noticed? did this kid my age maybe sa me? or maybe one of the employees? 

i don‚Äôt even know if i was sa‚Äôd, but i can‚Äôt stop thinking about it. my memory has always been super unreliable, as i‚Äôve had issues with remembering things my whole life. i don‚Äôt want lie to myself, and i want the answer. i know coming here won‚Äôt get me an answer, but i needed to get all of this out somewhere and maybe see if anyone has any advice or something. i‚Äôm sorry this was so long and confusing, im struggling  right now. if you can, please help me. thank you.",1,8.0,2024-12-26 05:44:15,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hmhzok/i_think_i_mightve_been_assaulted_when_i_was_young/

1hmidmz,post,Am I wrong to feel this way?,"  
Hi, I'm a victim of rape and SA from my father and grandfather. My grandfather raped me at the age of 8 and my father sexually assaulted me when I was ages 10-12 (lesser side of SA in my personal experiences but still SA). I've had many traumatic experiences and have been *professionally* diagnosed with cptsd and bpd as well as a few other things. However, I don't think they should be specified as they aren't relative or cause me issues in this area of life. Another thing to note is my prior mental health history with 5 inpatient stays (at mental hospitals) all between me being 9-13 years old. I'm a woman and, a minor. 

  
Background info:  
Around 2 years ago I was kicked out of my parents house for reporting my father for SAing me. My mother and family sided with him being headstrong in the belief that he would never do anything like that and that I was just getting my dad confused with my grandpa (Mom's Dad). In all honesty, I never meant to report him and I never thought about it as sexual assault before I called a hotline asking if it was normal because when I thought about those times I felt disgusting. The woman on the hotline asked for my story and decided it was a must to report this. She asked me for more information and next thing I knew I had started a case against my dad.

At first I hated him with my entire soul. I hated my mom for staying with him and cussing me out when I told her what I did. I hated my family for calling me a liar. I hated myself for tearing apart my own life again. I knew everything would be different. I slept on my grandma's couch for 4 months as we worked together to clean out my uncle's old room for me to stay in. My mom dropped off almost all my belongings week 3. This would be the start to my new, homeschooled life at my grandma's house.

Over the past 2 years I've been in extensive therapy working through my trauma and making sure that one day I can make a healthy life for myself.  I used to be reactive and fully of attitude sometimes even going as far as threatening to hit someone if their hands/body went too close to me in arguments. This was mostly due to the physical abuse/verbal abuse in my preteen years. However, I've been doing a lot better and haven't even gotten in an argument or any other outburst in 5 1/2 months. So I've been doing a lot better.

My question:  
Should I try to forgive and talk to my dad after 2 years of 0 direct contact? I feel like I'm ready and I won't have a panic attack and break down if I saw him. (That's what happened last time  I feel like what he did to me wasn't as bad as other people or even as bad as the experiences with my grandfather and I hold less grudge against him. He did traumatize me, he did abuse me in more ways than one, and I accept that truth. I also know that my two younger siblings miss me at home and wish they had a better relationship with their sister (especially the 8 year old) and having a relationship with my Dad could help mend the bridge that broke between us. Aside from my siblings I also miss him but that conflicts with my hatred towards him and it's just all so confusing. I wish I could know if what I'm feeling is normal or if it's just rebound of me wishing my life was happier and less lonely. Has anyone else felt this way? What did you do if so?? Please tell me because I need real answers from real survivors.",1,1.0,2024-12-26 06:10:08,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hmidmz/am_i_wrong_to_feel_this_way/

1hmifmk,post,Raped while blacked out & he videotaped it. ,"This last Friday I went out with my girls and my 2 guy friends, and us girls blacked out. We don‚Äôt remember leaving the club. The rest of this story is going to be told through what my friends have told me, videos, Ring footage & text messages. 

Once the club closed, we were all outside waiting for some to get Ubers and some of us to get into my guy friend‚Äôs car to drive us home. This guy, let‚Äôs name him Joe - comes up to me and was being very persistent of coming home with me or taking me to an after party. My guy friends told him no, she‚Äôs too drunk, she can‚Äôt consent and we‚Äôre taking her home. In the car ride home he was texting me things like ‚Äúsend me your address but don‚Äôt say anything‚Äù because he knew if I told my guy friends he was coming they wouldn‚Äôt let that happen. 

I get home and pass out. I stop responding to Joe‚Äôs texts for at least 30 minutes. He still shows up to my house. My roommate (who also doesn‚Äôt remember much since she also went out) wakes me up and tells me a guy is here for me. I invite him inside, but then my roommate tells him I‚Äôm too drunk and he needs to leave. After putting up a fight with her, he must have left through the side door, because my other roommate heard him go out, stand out there for a while and come back in. I never texted him or called in within that timeframe to come back in, so my guess is that he let himself into our house and back into my room. 

The ring doorbell shows he left at 7am the next morning. I woke up with no clothes on but I know I had sex. He texted me in the morning ‚Äúneed more of you.‚Äù 

I‚Äôve had sex with men after nights out often, but this felt different. I know sometimes I don‚Äôt seem as drunk as I am, but seeing video footage of myself from the night I was VERY drunk. Any sober man (which he was since he was driving) would know that, and if not, he was told my TWO people that I was not in a position to consent. 

I ignored his texts and calls as the following day went on. And then at 3am he sends me a video of him having sex with me and I look very out of it. That was so hard and heartbreaking to see. 

I did text him and told him that I don‚Äôt remember anything, and that he should‚Äôve known I was too drunk to consent and should‚Äôve known better. I told him if that video goes anywhere I will go to the authorities because I wasn‚Äôt in a position to consent to that being filmed. 

Part of me blames myself since I was the one who sent my address, I was the one who invited him in. I know now to not get to that level of drunk (I socially drink, but never get to that level) again.

I didn‚Äôt know if maybe I was imagining it? I remember the pain, and understanding that he was(sorry TW) anally penetrating me and then I blacked out. I was so confused.

m3ufx5c,comment,,"The way you wrote parts of this makes it seem like you think sexual assault victims give off certain vibes or something. It's possible you don't like being touched because of something happening but also plenty of people just don't like touching for plenty of other reasons (sensory, simple preference) 

Like saying ""I learned later this person was an sa victim (not knowing at the time) therefore it must have been because I could sense it"" is offensive to me. I guarantee you've met plenty of other victims that you would have no idea about so that specific assertion is really troubling. 

The stuff about feeling ""drawn"" to fictional characters or stories about SA compared to other forms of trauma or writing lots of fanfics with SA victims is also weird and makes it seem like you are romanticizing it. Maybe I'm being harsh but that's how that part of your post came off.
To be focused on writing characters as victims of sexual assault explicitly is very strange to me and admittedly this post triggered me and maybe I was being too harsh in my intial responses. 

None of this means you can't have been a victim and I hope you weren't but this isn't something we can answer. This would be a good thing to talk with a therapist about. You seem to have some self awareness about this but like correlating a change in personality as you grow or curiosity about sexual assault after learning what it was to mean you have some sort of repressed memory and cherry picking interactions with people or places where it may have happened before you formed a memory is concerning. Like you're trying to find evidence to fit a narrative you've already created vs looking at experiences and building the narrative from there. 

Maybe you were (again I hope you werent) but I think examining why you're so fixated on this to the point of writing numerous stories about it or seeking out media depicting it etc is a good idea. I realize that's part of what you're trying to do here but consider if you actually weren't or simply could never know what your motivations would be. What would it mean to have this confirmed for you? How would that really feel? The impact of something like this is horrifying and lifelong. (Again that doesn't mean every victim is the same or gives off special victim vibes, maybe thats not what you intended but thats how it came off to me) Having empathy for sexual assault survivors is not a bad thing but something about the way you have written parts of this is just off to me. I don't think you're a bad person for wondering or trying to learn more about yourself but please more carefully consider how you describe things and try not to generalize people.",1,,2024-12-26 07:10:06,t1_m3ucwj9,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hmhzok/i_think_i_mightve_been_assaulted_when_i_was_young/m3ufx5c/

m3uir07,comment,,"What a gross pervert. He had no right to do that to you when you were drunk, he's genuinely just a gross ""human"". The best thing I can recommend currently is to get a rape kit done and make a report as soon as you can/want to. (‚Å†ÔΩ°‚Å†‚Ä¢ÃÅ‚Å†Ô∏ø‚Å†‚Ä¢ÃÄ‚Å†ÔΩ°‚Å†)

Rape kits can range from $500-$1,200 but it is worth it to get them done since it's evidence against him for what happened. Usually during them they collect evidence from the crime scene (fluids, body swabs, etc) and it's collected as evidence. It's also to check for STDs and if you're pregnant from the assault. ‡∏Ö‚Å†^‚Å†‚Ä¢‚Å†Ôªå‚Å†‚Ä¢‚Å†^‚Å†‡∏Ö
 (Honestly they can be uncomfortable sometimes, but it's worth it, trust. [>_<] )

When you report assault you'll be asked to basically recount what happened (where it happened, what they did, etc). They could ask more specific questions, so you still have to be prepared. Try to collect all evidence you can, like text messages with him, photos, security footage, and basically everything your friends used to tell you what happened. Since he filmed it you could use it as further evidence to incriminate him, even if it's *really* gross. The police officer you report it to might act stupid, but mostly when you report sexual assault you report it to a patrol officer, and they are not specifically trained in handing sexual violence cases. (‚Å†„Äí‚Å†Ôπè‚Å†„Äí‚Å†)

Also, if you could you should also try to seek psychological help, or try to confide in someone you deeply trust. Usually, venting to someone helps when it comes to trauma of this magnitude. Even if you can't vent to someone, try venting into a journal/diary. (‚Å†¬†‚Å†‚óú‚Å†‚Äø‚Å†‚óù‚Å†¬†‚Å†)‚Å†‚ô°

Even if all of this seems daunting, it is possible. If you're nervous about this you can reach out to organizations related to sexual assault like RAINN, who can help you with your options or with reporting. (‚Å†ÔΩ°‚Å†ÔΩ•‚Å†œâ‚Å†ÔΩ•‚Å†ÔΩ°‚Å†)

I promise you will be okay after this, one word of advice I can give you is to not blame yourself for this. You are **not** at fault for *anything* that man did. Even if you were drunk or let him in, he had no right to do that to you. The thing about assaulters is that when they take advantage of someone in a weak mental state (mentally disabled, drunk, underage) they know what they're doing. He knew you didn't know what you were doing and didn't care. (‚Å†„Éé‚Å†ÔΩÄ‚Å†–î‚Å†¬¥‚Å†)‚Å†„Éé‚Å†ÂΩ°‚Å†‚îª‚Å†‚îÅ‚Å†‚îª

(Also turn your PMS off, creeps lurk on this sub to take advantage of victims.>:[ )

It will never be your fault for what happened, if a normal person wanted to have sex with you when you were in this same state they would not have done what he did. No matter what your brain or what stupid uneducated people say around you, this is not your fault. (‚Å†.‚Å†¬†‚Å†‚ùõ‚Å†¬†‚Å†·¥ó‚Å†¬†‚Å†‚ùõ‚Å†.‚Å†)

You did not deserve what happened, and I can assure you this trauma will get better with time. It may sting at first, or feel like it will last forever, but trust me it won't. You will feel better about what happened even if it seems impossible. I hope you're reading this while you're well.

m3ujalf,comment,,"Okay, whoever's telling you what happened was your fault is either ignorant, has previous biases, or is just a jerk.

Also, nobody in this subreddit should be calling you ""ruined"" or that you did something wrong, you did not do *anything* wrong, it's not your fault what happened. This subreddit is for support for victims, if someone is calling you names then they are breaking sub rules, and you should report them. Do not take anything those people say to heart, they are not worth it. Most of them are trolls, but some are just bitter survivors who put people down. (‡≤†‚Å†Ô∏µ‚Å†‡≤†) üëéüèΩ

And the reason why people are trying to take advantage of you is because you're a teenager who got assaulted. Many people lurk on this sub to take advantage of survivors and use them for their own fetishes. They message you because they think you're an easy target. I went through the same experience, and trust me, **every single adult who messages you about the assault is trying to take advantage of you**. There is a post at the top of this sub on how to turn off your private messages (dms), you should do that so creeps leave you alone. (‚Å†„Éé‚Å†ÔΩÄ‚Å†–î‚Å†¬¥‚Å†)‚Å†„Éé‚Å†ÂΩ°‚Å†‚îª‚Å†‚îÅ‚Å†‚îª

(Also if you tell this to an adult irl and they ask questions about if you ""came"" or liked it or anything similar to it, you need to tell someone, they are preying on you. >:[ )

Try to find support irl before trying to online, but if you can't, you can try using the National support hotline to talk to a counselor. Don't take advice from chatbots, everything they say is fiction. They can give you advice that can harm you since they don't know which facts are true and which aren't. You can vent to them, but don't take ***anything*** they say as valid or true. (‚Å†‚äô‚Å†_‚Å†‚óé‚Å†)

months and I've always liked him, but we just recently started dating. We went and saw a movie- a childrens movie, relatively empty theater but there were still other people, though not on our row. He puts his hand on my UPPER upper INNER thigh and I kind of freeze up- I'm super uncomfortable and i kind of start shaking. He just starts squeezing my thigh and I can't take it so I go to the bathroom. It's about 20 minutes later, and I'm kind of on my side towards him and he reaches over and just grabs my ass and I'm so uncomfortable but I'm completely frozen and couldn't get the words ""stop"" or ""no"" out of my mouth. And I'm like actively shaking with fear because I'm just so uncomfortable and and he's just rubbing his hand on my ass and thigh and it's so awful. I finally cant take it so I just check my phone and say i missed an important call so I go and ""take the call"" (i just cry in the bathroom because what do I even do). But i come back and i sit with my legs crossed with my purse in my lap so my legs are covered. And then he grabs my shoulder and kisses me and slips his hand underneath my bra strap. And it's so subtle but he doesn't take away his hand and hes just putting his hand further and further into my bra and i want to say something but again i literally can not talk for some reason. So finally i kind of just pick up his hand and hold it (and his other hand) so that he can't... like... touch me anymore. But then he drops my hand and puts it back underneath my bra and I'm so fucking scared that i can't even move his hand again so now im in a public movie theater watching a children's movie and he's touching me and i'm trying to make it obvious that i'm so uncomfortable but either he doesn't care or he doesn't notice. I don't know if this even counts as SA or if i was just uncomfortable and it's my fault for not just saying something- either way I just feel really gross but i don't want to call this SA and be dramatic.

It was like mid morning about 11am ish so it was bright and sunny outside. Then he started to compliment me and started to lean in for a kiss. I didn‚Äôt really want to kiss him but at one point I was pretty scared there was no one else in the parking lot and I thought it would just be safer to comply. So we made out and he made us move to the back seat and give him a bj. I was disgusted the whole time I didn‚Äôt want to do any of it. But I was so scared it might escalate. I told him I don‚Äôt want him to take his pants off but he kept undressing and pushed my head down too for a bit. Once he came, he just put his pants back on and drove back to Starbucks. The whole time back to Starbucks I was in shock. I didn‚Äôt register what had just happened to me. And when I was driving home, I was just blanked out in my brain. 

I blacked out this whole experience in my head and pretended it wasn‚Äôt that big of a deal for the last almost three years. Until I told my bf what had happened and he started really putting it into perspective. I was SA once before by a family member when I was younger so it happened once before. I felt guilty that I let this happen to myself twice and still froze in the moment. Like so extremely guilty to have not stood up for myself while it was happening. I don‚Äôt understand how I could‚Äôve let this happen to me again. My bf said I put myself in that situation by going in his car when he was essentially a stranger. It was a stupid decision to go with the guy and I agree I might have done it to myself. Now I‚Äôm starting to understand how these experiences have shaped me and are impacting my relationship. 
How do I let myself go on knowing I was the one who let it happen to me and now I hate myself for it? How do I better recognize the signs? This world is filled with far too many filthy and dirty men.",2,1.0,2024-12-26 07:56:35,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hmjsys/understanding_it_was_sa_years_after_it_happened/

1hmk2xm,post,is crying a trauma response or just how some people are? ,"all my sexual experiences were either in or after a sexually abusive relationship. I obviously had some curiosity I explored before getting into the relationship and then I didn't have any emotional termoil. my ex and I had agreed to not do anything before marriage so when he started doing things I responded by dissociating. after that, I began to almost always cry whenever we did things. he would be rough and I thought I enjoyed it but now I don't know because I'm not sure if it's supposed to cause such emotional distress. now if I ever orgasm while by myself I immediately start sobbing. this was something that happened while in the relationship. but because I don't have any other experiences, maybe I would have cried while doing things anyway and it's not a sign of trauma. I don't want to mentally write it up as a sign of trauma if it might just be something normal. is it exclusively a trauma response or might it be something I would have done anyway?

1hmk426,post,I learned that my ex boyfriend was coercing me into sex ,"I (F 19) recently went through a breakup with my boyfriend (M 19). He was someone who honestly seems to be addicted to sex or have way too high of a sex drive. Oftentimes, I didn‚Äôt quite care if he wanted it or not and just let it happen. After some talks with friends, they‚Äôve told me that consent is something that should be an enthusiastic yes. I‚Äôm just questioning if it was SA because I never directly said no but I never said yes either. I just simply didn‚Äôt care if it happened or not. I felt no strong feelings either way in the moment most of the time. Other times, I would mentally think that meh I didn‚Äôt want it that much but clearly he did so I‚Äôll just deal. On rare occasions, I didn‚Äôt want it at all, but was unable to say no unless my body hit a point where it physically prevented it from happening. I just need some advice on if all of that was SA and how to cope with that if it is.

1hmnpqg,post,My ex groped me,"I broke up with my ex a year ago. 

I thought we could have at least a decent friendship because I didn't consider him a bad person after all and we merely broke up because we were just too different in that context, but we would share laughs etc as friends, whenever he threw a party with colleagues/friends I would go etc

And I also hung out with him and nobody else. I started to become distant after a while because, everytime he saw me he would try to touch me in some sexual way and I felt unconfortable. It was useless to talk to him because he would never understand his mistakes and it was like talking to a wall. 

But one day we spent a day hiking in a park and he didn't touch me once, so I thought that maybe he was caring about our friendship and he was growing as a person.

But I was wrong.
Last night he asked me if I would go to his place to eat some Christmas leftovers, as he was alone. I merely came over to check on him and have a chit chat.
But it escalated when we were watching tv, he leaned his head on my chest and started rubbing his hand between my legs. I kinda froze for a couple mins laying there without doing anything.

Then I put my jacket and scarf on without saying a word, came home and blocked him everywhere. I won't let him disrespect me again and I'm tired of being patient over such people. 

It's still sickening. I'm tired because I've already been s.ad by other people in the past. 

Those people won't touch me ever again. I'm stronger now.",11,1.0,2024-12-26 12:49:39,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hmnpqg/my_ex_groped_me/

1hmpb18,post,Being touched inappropiately by cousin ,"Hi! So my cousin (26M) has been touching my other cousin (17F) and I (20F) inappropriately since we were little kids. I remember that during Christmas or other family reunions he would take us to a quieter or more private room of the house. Then, he would force us to sit in his lap or put us in some kind of sexual positions with him. He would then pounce or rub himself on us (clothed). And he didn't stop even if we asked him verbally or physically (like clearly showing discomfort or pushing him away). He would just grab us forcefully.

This started when I was around 10 and he was 16. Of course my little cousin and I didn't know what he was doing since we were so little. 

This continued until covid hit (I was 15, he was 21, and my little cousin 12) and after that we didn't see him as often so we eventually forgot. 

In 2022 I started seing him again because he wanted to hang out. He did the same thing. I was confused and didn't know what to do. This time I knew something was wrong but couldn't put it into words or recognize that it was sexual assault. And I was already 'used' to it since he has been doing it for years. I saw him one last time before moving abroad for college and he did it again. This time I felt really uncomfortable and disgusted. But I didn't say anything (again) because I was flying like the next day or so and had so much in my mind. I wasn't going to see him or my family in a long time anyway. 

This year it happened to my younger cousin. And fortunately she recognized what he was doing and told her mom. Her mom then talked with my cousin's mom.

Then nothing happened. They told us they were going to take some time apart from the rest of the family. That lasted like 2 weeks tho. Everything is back to normal except that we ignore each other during family reunions. No one else in the family knows about this. No real consequences were taken. I think it is possible that my aunt didn't really believe us or that she was persuaded by my cousin, who probably told her some kind of excuse saying that he had other intentions and it was all a misunderstansing. 

Yesterday during Christmas I was so mad seeing him act so dandy and innocent in front of everyone while my cousin and I were in a corner trying to stay as far away from him. He is highly regarded by most of my family as he always acts like a kind, caring and intellectual person. 

I feel so bad and guilty because I failed to recognize this or say anything earlier. I could've warned my younger cousin and this would've never happened. I believe in second chances and I would've been more understanding if he stopped doing this when he was still a teenager but he is a grown ass man now. I really don't think this is fair. He didn't even apologize or anything. I don't know what to do or what to feel. I don't even know if I would do anything at this point...

If you've reached the end, thanks for reading this chunk of text. I would appreciate any thoughts, tips, advice, etc. 

Happy holidays :)",7,2.0,2024-12-26 14:22:48,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hmpb18/being_touched_inappropiately_by_cousin/

m3vlq4f,comment,,"Him sexually assaulting you absolutely, beyond a shadow of a doubt, confirms to me that he abused you sexually when you were little. This behavior doesn‚Äôt come from nowhere suddenly - he‚Äôs been a sexual deviant since you were little. I have a few photos of me from my bath days but they are innocent and are of the type that most families probably have of their bath days. Most parents have a pic or two of their kids taking a bath and they are supposed to engender in us a cute and funny memory. For example, ours come up on the Alexa screensaver and my two kids are always cracking me and my wife up bc they are like ‚Äúdad, what the hell‚Äù and laughing and joking about it and we all are smiling (wife included and their is good energy and joviality surrounding it) - whereas with your photos, the energy is not the same üò¢üôÅüòü And when you say he assaulted you at 15 - well, it just furthers the reinforcement about the bath and the fears you have from water and so on.

m3vo8x0,comment,,"Hi, I'm so sorry about this situation. That's so sad and scary. At risk of sounding silly, have you told your mum yet? I hope that if she found out she'd be really horrified and hopefully stand up for your right to not have to see your cousin. I find it so sad and sickening that this guy abused you for so long and yet shows absolutely no remorse. 

Honestly I would go to the police about this. This guy is a full-blown pedophile, and hopefully testimony from both you and your cousin would count as evidence, although I understand that you probably don't have any 'physical' evidence. If you don't feel comfortable going to the police (yet), I would at least try to never have to see this man again. You don't have to give an explanation for it, if you don't want to/you're afraid your family won't believe you  - you could just say you're tired every time you're invited to a gathering he's at, and try to rearrange to see individual family members at times you know he won't be there. Just avoid him like the plague. 

In the meantime, it might be helpful for you to access some sexual assault counselling. A lot of SA charities give counselling for free to assault survivors. It was really helpful for me, and you can self-refer so your family doesn't have to know anything about this if you don't want them to.",2,,2024-12-26 14:42:11,t3_1hmpb18,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hmpb18/being_touched_inappropiately_by_cousin/m3vo8x0/

On a date to the movies as a young teen, the most that should have happened is him awkwardly putting his arm around your shoulders, and maybe a small, slightly awkward kiss at the end of the date which you both agreed to. Instead this guy gropes your thigh (in a very obviously sexual way) and gropes your breast. He never asked to do any of the stuff he did, meaning that he never gave you the opportunity to say 'no'. The reason you feel you didn't 'communicate' was because he never gave you the opportunity to do so. He just did it. The reason you couldn't speak was because you 'froze' - a very very common response a lot of people have while being sexually assaulted. When you 'freeze', it's hard to talk/get the words out.

m3vsgcv,comment,,"Hi, this is very much sexual assault. At risk of being hackneyed, I'm going to use the tea consent metaphor here, because it's a good one. You say that it might not be SA b/c you had done all the stuff he did to you before together. But that actually doesn't matter at all. 

Let's say that you and your ex regularly enjoy drinking a cup of tea together. You boil the kettle, he puts the teabags into the cups. It's a shared experience you're both making together. One night, you wake up to your ex physically forcing tea down your throat. Would you call that you both drinking a cup of tea? Because I wouldn't. The first example is a beautiful, shared experience. The second example is violent and unsettling, and nothing like the first. 

You never 'said no' because you were literally asleep at the start, and when you woke up you were 1. incredibly drunk and 2. in the middle of being assaulted, meaning you probably froze/disassociated and were unable to communicate.

m3vxarf,comment,,"I suppose it depends to me on whether or not you 'communicated' consent to this girl. Eagerly saying, 'yes' when she asked to kiss/touch you definitely suggests consent and I think doesn't put her at fault (although I don't think it puts you at fault either). However, in my opinion, if you displayed any of these behaviours, I think it becomes less cut and dry: 

\- being VERY OBVIOUSLY uncomfortable. Not just nerves, but stiffness/awkwardness, flinching away from her. 

\- freezing - not reciprocating, not moving. 

  
In both these cases, you are still very obviously giving a 'no', although it isn't a verbal one. So I think that leans closer to her assaulting you, even if she didn't 'intend' to. 

  
If you feel that you did give her an adequate basis on which to assume consent, I would say that it doesn't sound like assault but a really sad and horrible experience for you. Saying 'yes' to sex/sexual activity when you don't want it is actually a trauma response called 'fawning', which I have, so I really empathise with your pain.

The reason you 'just laid there' instead of fighting back wasn't because you're weak, or 'let it happen'. It's because you were being physically assaulted - it makes sense to lie still, as if someone is unhinged enough to attack you in your sleep who knows what else they're going to do?

I told my parents like I knew I was supposed to and although they believed me, it was always kind of brushed off because ""surely it wasn't on purpose"" üôÑüòí  Well years later my younger cousin confided in me that he went even further with her and physically assaulted her on multiple occasions, I don't know the details, I didn't want to ask. But now most of the family knows except his immediate family (wife, two kids) and my grandmother is trying to keep it all a secret to avoid upsetting his wife especially because we all know now and my grandma thinks that would make her even more upset. I obviously don't agree with this but even so there's been obvious tension where if the pedophile's family is at an event, the other family won't show up and his wife (my bio aunt who I actually like despite everything) has definitely noticed and takes it personally. I kind of think that we should just rip the bandaid off and if she doesn't believe us and stops coming around, then at least we tried and the other kids in the family will still be safer without him there.

1hmrai0,post,Is it possible to be just as traumatised from fawning as it is from being deliberately assaulted? ,"This is a very stupid question, but I've been thinking about this a lot recently and was wondering what other people think. So I am an assault victim, which was very horrible and traumatising, but I've had other unwanted sexual experiences in my life which have also messed me up, but I don't know if count as 'traumatic' because I technically consented, and my sexual partner never thought they were doing anything wrong. 

  
So a couple of years ago, I had a fwb and we used to hook up quite a lot. Specifically, she would go down on me. I have trauma in this area as that's one of the ways in which I was assaulted. However, I never communicated this to her and she genuinely thought she had my consent (she was very consent-minded, she seriously did nothing wrong). The problem was that I wasn't consenting, I was fawning. So I would pretend to consent and enjoy it because I didn't want to disappoint her, or make her sad. It's a bit pathetic but I was kind of in love with her and thought that if I let her go down on me she would want to date me instead of just hooking up. This is entirely on me, not her at all. The only 'sign' that I wasn't into it was that I would be completely dry down there every single time. But I don't think that can be used as strong evidence I wasn't consenting, because I gave every other sign that I was. 

While she went down on me, I would frequently disassociate, feel sick, afraid and terrible. Like seriously awful and disgusted and dirty. I would want it to end the whole time, and after I thought enough time had gone by I would pretend to cum so she'd stop. Idk why I never just asked her to stop, she wouldn't have minded at all. For some reason I didn't feel that I could - that it might 'ruin the mood' or something. The problem is, I think that her going down on me really exacerbated my trauma symptoms. I used to be fine with sexual partners touching me, but now they really can't touch me in any area at all without my body freezing up. I also regularly think back to and remember her going down on me, and the awful feeling of disassociation it gave me, and I feel sick and ill and anxious. I also feel weirdly really guilty for not being properly 'into it', I feel like I tricked her somehow. I feel really sad about the whole thing, and now feel afraid of bumping into her even though she literally did nothing wrong. 

  
Does anyone else relate to this? Am I just being overdramatic? Any thoughts/advice would be greatly appreciated.

We all decided to order something but since uber doesn't exist over there, we got a taxi driver that we knew to go buy them and drop them off. Since we were at an apartment complex, I was the one that went down and grabbed the food. I let the taxi driver into the lobby and he handed me food and something we had left in the car so my hands were occupied. Suddenly, he pins me to the wall and starts kissing my cheek and in my culture it's normal for people to greet eachother like that so i just excused it at first. I realised it was getting excessive as we was moving closer and closer. I swear for a second I felt his dick touch me from his pants. He kept kissing my cheek and for split moment he went for my lips, i dodged it and pushed him off me. 2 women walked into the complex lobby and didn't think anythng was strange. They went up the stairs and he kept going. I pushed him off for the final time and he leaves. I was so shaken up. I was shaking and crying. I didn't end up telling anyone except my cousin who told her mom which is my aunt and also told my uncle. They didn't mention anything to my parents. The next day, my mom went shopping and had the taxi driver drive her around. She had left her phone at home so the taxi driver called the phone and I picked up. He explained he was gonna come over and I would have to come down and give my mom her phone. I said okay and said to call the phone again when they get here and hung up. Wanting to avoid as much contact as possible. He calls back and says he wants to talk. He starts asking me if I want to marry him and I decline. He tries to defend his question by saying that he didn't mean at that moment but in the future. I said that I still wouldn't. He kept talking about how much he liked me and wanted to marry me. The day after that was the day I was travelling back home. We had to drive 5 hours to the airport, that whole time. All I could smell was his cologne from that night, I was sleeping in the van that was driving us and would wake up to the cologne. This went on for a week, now everytime anyone walks past me with that cologne I instantly recognise it and refer to it as the taxi driver cologne. Other then the night it happened, I rarely cried. I would only ever really cry about the situation when my brain thinks deeply about what happened and probably what would have happened if I didn't push him off and decline both times.",1,2.0,2024-12-26 16:02:21,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hmrbaz/was_it_sexual_assault/

I told them exactly what I said and they told me I woke them up to have sex but I have texts from a 2 years ago of them saying they couldn‚Äôt wake me in the morning (for other reasons) have I been assaulted?

I relate completely and have felt how you feel but maybe more info to know if she knew or didn't

Of course it counts

I think I actually acted harder that I was alright because I wanted to pretend to myself that I was fine and that I was enjoying it.

I am happy to say I am currently in therapy, and it's kind of depressing to realise the amount of sex I had that I didn't want but fawned. It sounds weird but it feels so shit to realise that your partner wasn't at fault, you weren't at fault, and something horrible still happened. I guess time is a great healer, so hopefully I'll just get over it eventually and feel better.

I think it's listening to your body but also take it step by step 

But also I read that with ptsd and trauma the logical part of your brain literally shuts off like its ability to reason and think and plan turns off

m3we1mk,comment,,"Yeah I relate entirely. Genuinely innocent actions freak me out so much now because I got so used to pretending to be okay with sexual comments and behaviours I was definitely not comfortable with. 

  
I think it's important to note that there doesn't have to be someone in the wrong for something to have impacted you. If she didn't do anything wrong, it's still okay to feel how you did because the situation itself was damaging. 

  
I've had so many situations where people definitely thought I was okay with what was happening or being said or that it was all jokes and funny etc, but I knew I was fawning - I 1000% get the feeling of ""tricking them"". It's really really hard to start to try and move on and have relationships etc again after trauma and negative situations but you're feelings are totally valid and it's okay to feel like the situation and the way you felt you had to act has impacted you without blaming her. I think a lot of people learn to have a fawn response in these situations, it just feels like a way to avoid negative reactions or consequences, even if you know there isn't really a risk of one.

  
You're allowed to acknowledge that it has had an impact, but it's also important to remember that fawning (and fight/flight/freeze reactions) are your brains way of stepping in to protect you, and it's very likely you felt that way based on prior experiences. It's okay to realise that a situation wasn't good for you even if the other person didn't intent any wrong. Recovering from this stuff isn't easy or particularly linear but you've got this, don't worry. I think my main advice is give yourself some grace, the fact you want everyone here to know that she did nothing wrong proves you're not out to get her or anything. You're not evil!!! You're feelings are real :)",2,,2024-12-26 17:15:57,t3_1hmrai0,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hmrai0/is_it_possible_to_be_just_as_traumatised_from/m3we1mk/

1hmtkvm,post,Liking Sexual Assault,"TW : Matters concerning SA

By the time I joined high school , I was further behind my peers in social interactions.

I was raised up in a cage, a comfortable one albeit, by a father who had been burnt by people such that he lost faith in humanity. Everyone was evil and malicious, opportunistic etc

So in High school, i was taken as the 'innocent' type. I was new to everything - lingo, dirty jokes...

That made me an easy target. Past curfew, I was approached multiple times by boys and held down for aggressive humping. The straight boys laughed it off as silly fun but I would always be left feeling like I lost my innocence. I hated it. They overpowered me. 
Taking it up with teachers would nail me as the social pariah. At home, I also started getting exposed to adults/uncle's who'd do some questionable things with a 13yr old ( an uncle taught us to play nude poker)

So I started fighting back-unsuccessfully. The adrenaline rush confused me and I started taking it as excitement that broke the monotony of school.

I realised that the more it happened,
the more I looked forward to it. I felt disgusting but I tried my best to push those feelings away..

Now I'm still struggling with those feelings every now and then and I'm scared of the path it will set me on

How do you deal? How do you fix?

1hmui7a,post,I was assaulted by my Ex best friends boyfriend,"TW: R*pe

I am at a complete loss for words‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll try to make this short because I am just so overwhelmed with everything that just happened

So I (21f) and my best friend Kiana (Now ex best friend) (21f) recently just had a sleepover at her place. Her boyfriend Devin (24M) lives with her so it was just the 3 of us that night of the sleepover. Around 10:30pm, Kiana started to drink heavily (she does this sometimes) and after a few drinks, she passed out. As I was trying to wake her up as I was concerned for her, Devin was behind me and scared the living crap out of me. I asked him what he wanted and he told me that he wanted to have s*x with me because he was sick and tired of Kianas drinking problems and was planning on breaking up with her. I told him ‚ÄúAre you f*king serious?‚Äù. As I got up, he pinned me to the wall (because he obviously couldn‚Äôt take no for an answer) and started kissing me so violently. As I tried to escape from him, he treated to take my life if I didn‚Äôt comply with his wish. So, as overwhelmed I was sadly, I caved in. After when he finished inside of me, I ran to the bathroom and cried for what felt like hours. Without me realizing it, it was already the next morning. So, I had courage to tell her what had happened to me. She didn‚Äôt believe me at all because she didn‚Äôt see it happening. I tried telling her she blacked out and all but interrupted me saying ‚ÄúLook, I didn‚Äôt see it happening so if I didn‚Äôt see it, then I know you are lying to me. Plus, Devin is my whole world. Now, quick being a B*tch or GFTO of my house‚Äù. As I left her house, I told her to go f*ck herself. So, here I am all alone at home and I don‚Äôt know what tf to do.

1hmwh2p,post,Memories from being raped last year are starting to haunt me. How to cope?,"Warning: mentions suicide and self harm. Sorry if that‚Äôs not allowed here. 

I was raped when I was 19 by my 24 year old ex boyfriend. It happened June of last year. We had (mostly) consensual sex two times before it happened. The third time was the first time I had actually said out loud that I didn‚Äôt want to. And I told him no and to stop over and over until it ended. I never reported it afterwards because I told one person and they didn‚Äôt believe me because my ex was ‚Äúsuch a nice guy.‚Äù So I didn‚Äôt want to deal with it because of that. 

Up until about a month ago I had been able to block it out and I never really thought about it anymore. But I was in a situation not that long ago and since then the memories of that night and the weeks before have started to come back.

It‚Äôs all I‚Äôm able to think about most days now. I hate it so much. I‚Äôve been able to talk about it with one friend but I‚Äôm trying not to because I don‚Äôt want to burden her with my issues. Not when she has her own stuff to deal with. I have an appointment with a therapist soon and I plan on talking about it then. 

But since these memories have come back and it plays so vividly, self harm and suicide have been on my mind a lot. I used to cut myself a lot when I was younger. And I started to again recently. I actually had to get stitches too. I want to go out and buy more razor blades. I just need a relief from these awful memories. Even if it‚Äôs just temporary. I want to try suicide again. I have ideas but not actual plans. I‚Äôm trying to convince myself to just stick around until my therapy appointment. That talking about it with a professional will be helpful. 

Does anyone half advise on coping with this kind of stuff? I feel like I‚Äôm at the end here. I don‚Äôt know what to do. ",1,1.0,2024-12-26 19:55:34,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hmwh2p/memories_from_being_raped_last_year_are_starting/

1hmx7el,post,CSA symtoms without getting abused?,"
ive been thinking about this topic for some time now, ill write down my experiences as best as i can and hope someone can help me to find out whats going on with me, and if this is normal or something to be looked into more !!

soooo i have a rape fetish; i dont know when EXACTLY it started for me but it was definitely there already when i was 9 ‚Äì i think ive had it for longer tho !! what i know too is that as a little kid i was already VERY very sex/dating obsessed (starting at around age 4 i think) even before my mom told be about the flowers n the bees (so i dont know how i even knew about the concept of sex before she told me)

what i know is that others with a fetish like that / others that have displayed sexual interest so young have been abused sexually early on so for them its a trauma-reaction thingy, but i am quite sure that no one ever did anything like that to me when i was little? i know people can also forget their traumatic experiences but i just THINK there hasnt happened anything in my case. i can never know for sure ofc.

so like,,, what could it be from? i dont think that small kids just develope these weird sexual tendecies out of NOTHING, or can they?

some more infos abt me that may be helpful in any way idk
- female, 19 now, been dealing with lots of other mental stuff all my life (depressed/suicidal since like 7? and i also have diagnosed bpd + adhd + autism + an eating disorder)
- i have been raped countless times through my teenage years but it never turned me on AT ALL, it was just a ""well this is rlly unpleasent i wanna get out of here!"" situation every time but i dont feel like it traumatized me, there was just one incident where i felt nasty after and had to take a shower

so ive never ever really been doing well in life ever since i was born, but still there was no straight up ABUSE (in my toddler years) that makes me think it couldve caused anything like that

- its also nothing im happy about having ! i hope these feelings go away someday -

please tell me ur thoughts in the comments without being mean lol im sensitive n have bad experiences with reddit <3 this is a sensitive topic and i hope im not offending anyone Ôºà‚ïπ‚ó°‚ïπÔºâ‚ô° happy holidaysss

m3xrrsi,comment,,"what I mean by that is, he held me down and forcefully penetrated me, but not with his genitalia. he forced his genitalia into my mouth, but that isn't quite rape. and then people say ""did he rape you?"" and I have to defend him and explain that technically he didn't. I just hate that I feel like I'm defending him every time and that he can go around and say that he didn't when what he did was still super traumatizing. I feel like my experience was invalid and it sucks. I feel so invalid at times that I feel like it would be simpler if it just was clearly rape instead of being a bunch of things leading right up to it. in looking into legal definitions, some of the things he did were technically categorized as raped, so depending on the terminology used, he did rape me. but because he didn't forcefully penetrate me with his genitalia there's people who don't think it counts and don't think it's a big deal. I don't see much of a difference for me if he just fully raped me except I would have been able to do more to fight against him legally and would be able to confidently call him a rapist instead of this weird gray area. it just sucks having to explain to people nuances around the word and him being able to get away with what he did. I strongly identify with the word rape and was penetrated against my consent but I don't know if I can call it that and trying to figure out the legal definitions is so complicated. it feels like he found a loophole to not be called a rapist and it's not fair that he gets to get away with what he did. according to certain legal definitions what he did was rape. I just wish it would be considered that without me having to explain all these technical definitions and stuff because then people don't think it's as big of a deal

1hmz9he,post,Is this common or it's just my family? Am i overreacting?,"Not sure where to even start it. With some prestory i guess. So in my family on the Christmas eve we all used to gather up and celebrate together, granddad would dress up as Santa and kids would sit on his lap, tell him what they would want and then he would give out the presents. He is too sick now to do that and i guess there will be no more big gatherings and instead my dad will be dressing up as Santa for our family and my cousins dads for them etc. But this year there still was gathering a few days before Christmas and even though granddad doesn't bring presents my aunt thought it will be a good idea if kids for the last time sit on his lap and tell him about presents they would want to get, ""kids"" included everyone under 18 and even some older people as a joke, i think i am too grown up for that (f15), but i still got pressured into participating and as i did sit on his lap he put one hand on my low behind, and another on my thigh, i was wearing a skirt just above the knee, too high for comfort, and rubbed a little, it got me really uncomfortable, and the worst part nobody noticed it, or chose not to notice, and he did that to every girl aged above ten, he didn't put his hand on the butt of any boys, i was specifically watching, so i am not my imagination, but nobody said anything, even the girls themselves, and it made me think i am overreacting about this one. I don't remember him doing anything like this in any years before but once on a random day he tried to sweet talk me into sitting on his lap too, but he was talking to me and offering treats like i was 5 and i was like 11 or 12, it annoyed me so i didn't do it.

And on the Christmas evening at home dad as a Santa was giving out gifts and hugging everyone and during a hug he groped my butt. I cannot be overreacting to this because it wasn't the first time, similar things happened before and i always tell him i don't like when he does that and not to do it again, not immediately because when it happens all the thoughts like fly out of my head and everything becomes a mess and i just can't collect myself up to do anything about it, but in like 30 mins i do, and he always says it wasn't what i thought it was or just laughs at it. He also once poked my chest with a finger saying ""getting plumpy huh"", or when during a hug he can try subtly touch chest too. Lots of such things recently, sometimes i notice him looking under my shirts if i lean forward, or earlier this year i had some girls over we were doing a school project, making banners and stuff, crawling all around the floor and i was in a skirt and i saw him looking under it. And earlier this month while buying new jeans i came out of the booth and stood before the mirror to show him and he said i look good in those and groped my butt as well. He most often pulls something like this after buying an unexpected gift. I used to tell mom about it all and she would usually say it's not what i imagine or tel him to stop teasing me, one time i made a scene out of it and dad got really upset saying that he works hard and tries to make everyone happy not for the kids to try to make him a pervert, it made me feel bad and i tried not to overreact to this for a while, but one time he did this again and i just couldn't stay quiet, i told my mom again but i think she thinks now i am too dramatic about this one, she just said ""oh no, you are gonna fall apart now or what? Please don't bug me with this right now"", she's recently very busy with my younger brother and sister, so i think she was just busy, and i didn't tell her about jeans one, and not sure if i should tell her about the thing that happened on Christmas",0,1.0,2024-12-26 22:01:24,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hmz9he/is_this_common_or_its_just_my_family_am_i/

it's okay. I know I've definitely felt some anger at different stages of processing and yeah it's all a lot of emotions.

I haven't reported him to the police or anything. I've been in the legal advice subreddit asking some questions to see if I can. most of the assaults were in 2023 so it's been a little while ago and I don't have any hard evidence. but my parents know and I've spoken to the church we both go to. we've kinda tried to reach out to his parents but they aren't very receptive, tho it's kind of understandable because no one wants to think their son would do something like that. but I'm looking into what reporting him would entail",1,,2024-12-26 22:17:11,t1_m3xulhp,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hmxufj/does_anyone_else_ever_feel_like_their_assault/m3xw3vw/

1hmzwn3,post,I understand that he r*pd me because he wanted to feel power over me. He wanted to destroy me and he won.,"This is my story and how I met the most evil man in my whole life. This was around 14 months ago.

I worked at a upscale establishment it was my ever first job I was 19 and fresh out of culinary school, I loved my job honestly it was my life.

one individual, an older man that I'm not going to name, who'd been there for years, always seemed to resent me he tried to bully me but my coworkers shut him down and I think that made him even more angry. I never viewed him as a threat, nor did I see any reason for his animosity towards me. We rarely spoke to each other.

Our worlds collided when my promotion arrived. It did surprise me that I got the promotion I don't think I deserved it if I'm going to be honest and I know that a small reason why I got it is because of something I did that I don't feel like mention here. he wanted to have that promotion. But he was lazy did the minimum and was disliked by most people there.

One fateful night, after the last patron had left and the dishes were cleared, He cornered me in one of the restrooms he was high with something my best guess is maybe that it was snow. There is no reason for me to explain the details on what happened next.

The next day I went back to work in the early morning I think I was in shock It felt like I was dreaming that day. I knew that he was also there but my mind didn't register it.

Well He pressed his hips into the curve of my backside grinding himself against me in a clear act of dominance. My body went limp it was like I couldn't move. I remember feeling his thing through his pants. I was frozen in terror as this man, who had already taken so much from me, continued to exert his power over me.

I remember him saying to me ""You're mine now,"". It was obvious to me that he wasn't planning on making it a one time thing he was going to continue breaking me down.

He went on to describe how he would continue to violate me. to degrade and humiliate me, how his friends would love me, how he would make me a single mother as if that were the ultimate punishment. 

I had a mental breakdown after this. I went home and broke down. I felt all my emotions clash down it was like my mind had realized what had happened the night before and what could continue to happen. I ended up quitting that job and I didn't leave my apartment for 4 months.

I never reported what happened; I couldn't bring myself to relive the experience in front of others. I still feel the shame and guilt and weak. I fear that if I ever meet him again and if he does it to me again then I would break i'm already broken but that would be the final nail in the coffin. The ironic thing is that I could probably had destroyed his life if I was brave enough if I had reported him but I was to weak for that. I respect every woman out there that are strong enough to report what had happened to them but I wasn't able to.",6,1.0,2024-12-26 22:31:34,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hmzwn3/i_understand_that_he_rpd_me_because_he_wanted_to/

m3xzy1v,comment,,"Truthfully I had those thoughts for years after being sexually assaulted by sister‚Äôs ex for 3 years straight, basically 6 times a week out of those 3 years. I was 12-15 and kept having the mindset that doing sexual activities despite not being ready for them and it made me feel terrible. I was stuck in the cycle that it could have been worse and to make people stay nudes, touching them, or sexting would make them stay. It took getting my first boyfriend and having sex for the first time while being overly excited that what I went through was terrible, while it could have worse I was glad it wasn‚Äôt. What I went through is not based off some scale of who has worse trauma, but how it affected me on such a deep personal level. What you went through matters and while haters say ‚Äúat lease you weren‚Äôt raped‚Äù, but that doesn‚Äôt really matter on the basis of things. Sexual assault is not a scale of what is worse because it all changes how we think and act. Try changing your outlook on what happened to you because even though it could have worse, your feelings still matter and that should be thought about more rather than the mindset that it doesn‚Äôt mean anything or your feelings don‚Äôt matter because it wasn‚Äôt enough.

1hn0tdv,post,A childhood friend aked me to play at the man and the woman,"
Recently I remembered an old childhood memory from when I was 7-9 years old. I apologize in advance if my English is weird since I use a translator. I asked myself a lot of questions after rediscovering this memory and I can't think of anything else. This really worries me. At that time I often played alone in my room with the neighbor's daughter who was a little around my age. Nothing alarming, until she suggested that I play man and woman. She wanted me to play the man (I'm a girl) and she the woman but I didn't really understand what that was. She told me that these are the things that adults do when they are in love, and that she was going to make an example of me by taking on the role of the man. So she started making circular motions around my nipple through my clothes. Fortunately it didn't go any further, I don't remember why she stopped her action. Thinking about it, I feel quite perplexed. His gesture was inappropriate but what worries me the most is his behavior. When does a 7-9 year old girl do this? I think she was exposed to content inappropriate for her age or reproduced acts that she herself suffered... I admit that I didn't really know where to share this story, I hope that my post n is not inappropriate for this subreddit. But I would like to have your opinion on his behavior.

Im laying here thinking how my ex would gas light me into saying yes to sex no matter how many times i would say no, or when my ex was on top of me and i told them to get of me and my ex said no and kept going, how i would not even be aroused yet they kept going, my ex would gas light me into having sex with them for often 2 hours and it sucked the entire time, even when they would stop when i asked they would get upset and blame there bad mood on me wanting to stop and gas light me some more until i said i was willing to continue

Hell my ex would even pull my hair or choke me to ""turn me on"" when i would say i didn't want to

Im laying in the bed this all happened in and i hate it

I just need some support or something, Only person i can talk to about this is my bestie i dont want to bother her with this as i feel like i already bring it up enough

some more contexts. I have been broken up with my ex for a year after dating them for a year and a half, repressed the memory's for so long, i never even admitted to myself it was sexual assault and gas lit myself it was ok and that i just had a shitty ex with it all being normal for so long until my bestie just the other week helped me realize what my ex did was sexual assault after she helped me while i broke down from a flash back i got

I feel like im being dumb posting this but, i just need some support, some advice on how to heal, just anything. please....

m3z7qmf,comment,,"Sounds like you're in an extremely difficult position where someone you love could have been greatly hurt by another person you love. I sympathize with you greatly right now and know you have the strength to work through this. With that being said there're a few things that make currently knowing the truth difficult.


Do your brother and husband not get along, is there a reason he would lie about this? If your brother lied why would your daughter not immediately say no it never happened. It seems like if your brother lied she would stick up for her step dad. Her not giving you an answer makes it seem like she was threatened to not talk about it. But at the same time if your brother saw it why would he not make a scene and immediately jump in to stop it? Does your daughter not like your husband? Could your brother be threatening your daughter cause of some beef with your husband? 

You say that you've indirectly talked to your husband about this what was his answer/what did you ask?

You say that your daughter isn't giving you answers what did you tell her/what did she respond?


Regardless of everything you currently know the consequences of not doing anything if this is true are life changing, so you need to take action.


 If she's not giving you straight answers then I would make sure she knows she's not in trouble, and that she will not get in trouble, but it's non optional that you guys are going to the hospital to get a kit done. Also there are professionals there who are trained to get kids to tell the truth on these things, so your best bet is having one of them talk to her. Don't tell your husband/brother anything cause they could try to start manipulating her/you and or destroy evidence.

Go as quickly as possible (literally tonight if you haven't already) cause the kits become less accurate the longer you wait.",6,,2024-12-27 03:15:57,t3_1hn3c8h,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hn3c8h/my_husband_sad_my_daughter/m3z7qmf/

1hn6oqp,post,My brother saved me from being r*ped and has no idea ,"So this comes and goes out of my mind alot, recently I‚Äôve been struggling with my ptsd a bit more and I‚Äôve unfortunately had more than a handful of SA happen to me which I won‚Äôt get into here. Anyways, I‚Äôve wanted to tell my brother but I‚Äôve kept it a secret out of shame and disgust but I want him to know he saved me from having something horrible done to me and I haven‚Äôt told anyone but I‚Äôve wanted to say something about it and give my brother some form of appreciation for saving me from them even though he has no clue.  
I was in high school, I think sophomore, and two guy friends (I thought were my friend) decided to hangout one day after school, we smoked a joint in the woods, and went back to my house to have snacks and hang out. We went up to my room cause I had plenty of seating and entertainment like my video games. It didn‚Äôt take long for the weed to really kick in, and I had never ‚Äúlost‚Äù control of my body before now, I sat down on my bench and next thing I know guy (A) sits next to me, he started flirting with me (he had never done this before), I decided I wanted to get up and move away because I wasn‚Äôt interested. As I tried to walk away guy (A) grabs my waist and forces me on his lap and won‚Äôt let me go, he grabbed my chest and started groping me, immediately I tell him to let go and stop but he just grabbed harder, it hurt a lot. All he said was ‚Äúyou like that, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù. Guy (B) was sitting on the floor and got up once guy (A) started groping me. Next thing I know guy (A) tells guy (B) to grab my legs. I couldn‚Äôt fight back, I started crying telling them to stop and let go, that they were hurting me. I tried kicking, and pulling their hands off me but I was too weak. It felt like trying to escape from a blanket wrapped too tightly around me. This all happens within a few minutes. As I‚Äôm struggling I hear my brother laugh in his room across the hall. And then they stopped like deer in head lights, Guy (A) gets mad and says, ‚Äúyou never said your brother was home‚Äù. They let go almost instantly, got their shit and left. Again my brother has no idea, he had his headphones on playing video games in his room. So yeah, my brother saved me from being r*ped, he has no idea and I can‚Äôt thank him for it without telling him. So now whoever reads this knows.

1hn78m3,post,I Was Stealthed While Drunk,"A woman and I share mutual friends. We have been hooking up for a bit now. 

We both attended a party with these friends recently and I got blackout drunk, like to the point where I could not walk on my own. She was also drunk but was still pretty functional. 

At the end of the party, my friends dropped me at my room. This woman eventually showed up at my door and we were hooking up. 

I guess I was smart enough in that state to put on a condom, but every time I checked on it, it would be gone. This happened 3 times. 3 times a condom got taken off of me. She was on top of me and I was not really in the mind state to acknowledge what was going on. That is all I remember. I don‚Äôt remember how I fell asleep or when, but I woke up the next morning and I have been paranoid in the days since then. 

I feel really violated about the whole thing, she doesn‚Äôt seem to care, telling me that I‚Äôll be fine. 

I understand it gets sticky when both parties are drunk but I genuinely feel like I had no control in that situation, and any time I tried to take control over the interaction by wearing a condom, I realized they were gone, she would take it off of me without me knowing. 

I‚Äôm just really worried about what could follow in the coming days considering all that arises with unprotected sex, and me realizing how uncomfortable this made me in the moment and after the fact, I‚Äôm really freaked out. 

I guess I‚Äôm just looking for advice on how to move forward with this. Being a man, it feels like I shouldn‚Äôt acknowledge what happened, and I feel like nobody would believe a word I say, regardless of how I KNOW I feel. 

Please be patient and kind, this is a lot for me and I‚Äôm just not sure how to be handling this situation.. thank you. ",3,1.0,2024-12-27 04:50:26,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hn78m3/i_was_stealthed_while_drunk/

1hn8ugt,post,was it r*pe?,"
hello to anyone reading this, if ur reading this. I apologize for any spelling errors in advance, this is just a slight dump of my thoughts bc i feel trapped in a way, i dont think anyone is gonna read this but writing it will make me feel better i think.

Im a 16 year old teenage girl and i recently lost my virginity i guess. I wish i didnt. I regret it ever since and i feel like a whore. 

Why? Well because it felt wrong, i didnt really know this guy. We were talking and i met with him, he brought me to this apt that no one goes to cuz its for rent. It was reallyyy dirty and scary, so was the area we were in. 

At first it was ok, we were watching a movie and we were cuddly and it was ok with me bc i talked with him for awhile and he was a sweetheart. So i thought.

He started getting really aggressive, the way he touched me and spoke to me. I didnt wanna get naked but he removed my top clothes forcefully. And, yes i did try and stop him woth all my strength but he was strong.

When he touched my body he wasnt really feeling it, he was just, idk how to explain it. He was just trying to rip it apart somehow? Like cuteness agression? Which i mean its not bad i guess.  Eventually he got in my head and made me take all my clothes off. He was very aggressive with me and at one point he said i dont have a choice, that i have to either give him head or let him f*ck me. 

I think its my fault because i kept making him mad just to push him. I was laughing. Then he said hes gonna k*ll me, but like as a joke? After he was done taking my virginity he left me on the bed, under the covers and went to go clean himself . He barely said anything to me when he came back and put his clothes on.

He did ask if i was ok, bc i wanted to cry i didnt know what to feel. After some time we got dressed and we watched the movie and talked. He got horny again and he wanted me to give him head and i didnt want to. So he slapped me around and choked me, which honestly its normal for a lot of people so i didnt think much of it. But i asked him. ‚ÄúDo i not get a choice?‚Äù He replied with ‚ÄúNo u dont, u either suck it or u let me fuck u‚Äù . He ended up doing both. He wasnt kissing my body or anything he was just tearing it apart like a wild animal. He didnt care of my pleasure he only wanted his.

Afterwards i got home  and a few days later he blocked me. What did i do wrong?How can he jsut take my virginity away from me and leave. I know its my fault for letting it happen but what could i do in that situation? I cant do much can i?
I feel sick sometimes, im mad at myself for being so stupid. I hate myself and i hate my body. Why didnt he care about me? Why did he just have to leave after doing that? Is it bad i wanted him to stay and not block me? 

And i did enjoy it for a bit, but idk if i really wanted to. Idk what to think anymore, i think im being dramatic like usual. Ive been SA a lot in my life but i feel like this might be more? Or maybe not? Idk.
Im sorry.",3,7.0,2024-12-27 06:28:07,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hn8ugt/was_it_rpe/

1hn90gg,post,Just a rant,"Throwaway account. So I was sexually abused by a family member  multiple times over the summer when we were both teenagers. Sometimes I‚Äôll still think about it, some days I‚Äôll just wake up one day with a sense of dread and just feeling overall hyper sensitive/aware of my surroundings. During such times my skin will feel like it‚Äôs burning whenever someone touches me, every sound makes me jump and being around men make me uneasy, but when that feeling passes I‚Äôll go back to normal. When my mother found out she didn‚Äôt take it well and became angry and complained that ‚Äúnow I‚Äôll have to take you to therapy‚Äù (which never happened), made me send a text to the parent of this person with a more or less apology letter she wrote but made me send it as if it were coming from me. Occasionally she‚Äôll bring this person up in conversation almost trying to get a reaction out of me. For a few years my mother would reach out occasionally and I shit you not say ‚ÄúJust have a private conversation in person and talk things out and just tell them how much you love them‚Äù. Obviously my relationship with my mother has never been the same since. I just wish that this person would just admit it and finally have my family  be on my side. I know that‚Äôll never happen, the only one who knows the extent of the abuse is my partner and it took me over 5 years to tell them.. side question, is it strange and/or normal behavior after something like this that I have the need to seek out books/fan fiction about SA And feeling a sense of peace when said victim gets the justice they deserve?

1hn9btn,post,Am I overreacting or did my grandpa sa me?,"NOTE: English isn't my first language so sorry if I make some grammar mistakes.

When I was little, (around 5 to 8) my Grandma and my Grandpa would sometimes spank me and my older brother's butt in a playful and lighthearted way to joke around with us. As I grew older, (9 to 11) my Grandma stopped with the spanking, my Grandpa too, but he only stopped spanking my Older Brother. He did not stop spanking me until the age of 11. During that time, whenever he could somehow sneak behind me, he would spank me, and he would spank me harder than he ever did before in my younger years, so hard my bottom would sting a little bit, and during the aftermath of the slap when he could obviously see how upset I was, he would either laugh at me or give me this creepy smirk. I remember younger me would feel violated and disgusted after these slaps on my butt, an area that's supposed to be private. I also thought it wasn't fair that my older  brother didn't get slapped  and that I, the younger SISTER did.

Another instance where I felt disgusted by him again but in a different way was when I was around 12, the age when he finally stopped slapping my butt. I was on my Grandma's couch just watching TV when he decided to sit down next to me. Due to the incidents above, I decided to scoot down a little further away from him because I do not trust sitting that close to him. I think he noticed this and decided to get closer to me, and then not even a second later he started dragging his hand to me, then his two fingers pretending they were sortve this spider-like thing. His two fingers got closer and closer and then under the blanket I had over me, the two fingers got close enough to touching half my leg when I decided to scram because I DO NOT TRUST THIS MAN ANYMORE. This happend again in the same week but he never ended up fully touching me because I would quickly run away.

To this day I still haven't told anyone. I feel like they will laugh at me the same way he did or end up thinking none of this was that much of a big deal.",2,1.0,2024-12-27 07:01:15,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hn9btn/am_i_overreacting_or_did_my_grandpa_sa_me/

The guy told me he lived near my house and because I couldn't think I didn't refuse, kept asking for his name but he wouldn't tell me, and then when we arrived at my house he took the opportunity to go inside and fuck me, I was so confused kept asking why did he wanted to fuck if I couldn't even move, I was literally and object and at some point I lost consciousness.

1hnadh5,post,My partner ignored me for two minutes,"Had a lovely evening with new partner, decided to get down.

My ex partner was quite sexually abusive and manipulative, so I do experience trauma and such from that.

A common part of that was to overstimulate me into an inability to say or do anything.
New partner began doing that, and I became uncomfortable as it makes me feel sick to get into a similar headspace of that again.

I began pushing him off me and begging him to stop, and yet he didn‚Äôt for two minutes.

I couldn‚Äôt look at him for the next hour and he spent the entire time crying whilst I was in a state of shock and numbness. Never did I think I‚Äôd hear the words ‚ÄòI‚Äôm sorry for r***** you‚Äô.

I guess I‚Äôm looking for some advice. 
I decided to forgive him that night. 

He is quite inexperienced and explained he had assumed it was CNC stuff which we had discussed a little in the past, however I had explained to him multiple times that you need to do a lot of research and build an extremely substantial amount of trust before attempting that, alongside a discussion beforehand outlining on and off the table things, and the inclusion of a safe word and a non-verbal safe action. 

I asked him to do, and be better. Explained the gravity of what he had just done, and when he mentioned how bad he felt I said good. I said that I hope he never forgets this, because I won‚Äôt. 

I‚Äôve been clinging onto the fact that he supposedly loves me. But I‚Äôm struggling as most days he‚Äôll mention how down he is about it. All I can think of is that quote from Shameless with the shopkeepers wife. ‚ÄòYou bastard! What about me?‚Äô 

Truly, I‚Äôd be comfortable supporting him throughout this so long as I was experiencing equal and ample support.

Should I be forgiving him? 

TL;DR
Partner ignored me begging to stop for 2 minutes, I held him accountable but forgave him due to lack of experience/knowledge and a belief that he doesn‚Äôt actually want to hurt me. It feels as though he‚Äôs made it much about himself, and the upset he‚Äôs experiencing when I‚Äôm splitting in half trying to come to terms with the fact that I will always know the man I want to marry did that to me. 
Was I wrong to forgive him? ",1,1.0,2024-12-27 08:17:07,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hnadh5/my_partner_ignored_me_for_two_minutes/

Realizing how my CSA have shaped who I am with the kinks I've developed¬†","Starting at the age of 5 my family was not in good shape. My parents had addiction problems so never really looked after me but we lived next door to my aunt and uncle so we ended up spending a lot of time there. I had an older cousin who was 27 at the time. He was cool at the start but then things started getting weird with him when he started showing me R rated movies and then porn over time. While this was happening he was kissing me, showing each others private parts, touching which became somewhat of a norm and then with porn it became more handjobs and blowjobs over time. This was incentivized by ice cream or chocolate on his dick while he watched movies and stuff I didn't know any better and this was somewhat of a fun exercise for me while enjoying ice cream or chocolate as I had a sweet tooth growing up. This went on for years and over time the intensity of it grew with him pushing me to do better and stuff.







I feel like that really fucked up my perception of sex and caused me to mature MUCH faster than I should have. I shouldn‚Äôt have been hypersexual at 11 years old, developing a kink for blowjobs growing up at that age and wanting to show off to boys whenever I had the chance at that age. And I think about how we had very different experiences in terms of developing our sexuality.







One of my ex boyfriends was surprised at the fact how hyper sexual I was and when I shared my story with him he broke up with me.¬†







I should have had time to be a kid. I should have been talking about kissing or making out at most in middle school, and not have been planning out/roleplaying full kink scenes with strangers online and friends from school.







I shouldn‚Äôt have been wearing clothing that intentionally showed off my body when I went to parties and had very questionable slutty nights.¬†







I‚Äôm 19 and am just now starting to realize how much my hypersexuality has impacted my life over the years.",2,1.0,2024-12-27 08:18:28,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hnae6o/realizing_how_my_csa_have_shaped_who_i_am_with/

1hnbdsu,post,I‚Äôm tired of people ‚Äúglorifying‚Äù assault,"Title basically. I‚Äôve seen too much content being made recently about sexual assault that is so unbelievably missing the point it‚Äôs upsetting. Whether it‚Äôs games, movies, whatever. People just expect their characters that had been assaulted to be a certain way, to act a certain way. 
As an example, I feel most people have heard of the game mouthwashing by now; and the treatment of the victim and how she interacts between characters is so awful, it often makes me reflect on my own experiences. To me it feels like the creator of the game failed in many instances to really understand the dichotomy between ‚Äúfriends‚Äù, or whatever you want to call it that directly impact or are influenced by someone‚Äôs assault. The fallout between people you thought cared for you/how they react when you reach out just felt hollow to me. 
 Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm going through something similar but it‚Äôs almost painful how the game paints the picture that just because your friend has relations to your assaulter, doesn‚Äôt mean you should hate them. (I guess since they didn‚Äôt assault you directly it‚Äôs ok? But associating with someone who did is fine?) whatever. I‚Äôm just tired of seeing media revolving around assault where so many of the issues are surface level, but don‚Äôt consider other relationships within them. Also using assault as a plot point with so little deep discussion is tiring. Sometimes you just wanna get away from it, not see more.

1hnc2t5,post,Trauma-Induced Asexuality?,"Title is pretty much the main concern, I experienced date rape around this time last year and since then there has been a huge damper on my sex life. I cannot stand the sensation of penetration most days and my partner and I pretty much have an asexual relationship. I am worried about it affecting my relationship with them and any possible relationships I may have in the future.

This was not my first SA, I have experienced sexual exploitation on multiple different occasions since I was a child. However, the ""asexuality"" I am experiencing has not been as pronounced as it has been until this year.

I want to enjoy sex and have a libido again, it's just that anytime I am in any kind of sexual situation, I either feel very anxious and fearful or I feel disgusting and shameful. Has anyone else experienced this? Will therapy be able to help me with this?",1,1.0,2024-12-27 10:24:51,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hnc2t5/traumainduced_asexuality/

1hnc33h,post,I need opinions ig (be honest),"My memory is a bit foggy for so many reasons but this one has kinda stuck with me for years. I‚Äôm constantly questioning myself as to if it was sa so I need peoples opinions and honest ones too. I wanna know if it was some form of sa or if it was just something else idk. I don‚Äôt want to bring it up in therapy yet, let alone ask her if it was cause although we have a really good relationship and I can tell her almost anything, this is something I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm ready to bring up even if it isn‚Äôt sa. 

When I (21F) was little, around 5 maybe my step-cousin (dads, sisters husbands daughter) would‚Äôve been minimum 13 (I somewhat remember her being in high school was discussed). She used to force me to kiss her, like make out every time we saw each other, and it went on for a while each time I saw her. She would take me into a cupboard or a room where there was no one else. This went on for a few years before I stopped seeing my dad‚Äôs side of the family all together. 

At the same time, in my dad‚Äôs care again, my neighbour at dad‚Äôs house (who was my age) used to make me do similar things. I have some memories of her talking me into going into the cupboard in my room (it wasn‚Äôt very wide) and she would close the door where it was essentially pitch black and she would get me to sit down and she would essentially put her crotch in my face and like ‚Äòwiggle‚Äô? Idk if that‚Äôs the right word. 

I was young and didn‚Äôt really understand what was going on and that it isn‚Äôt ‚Äònormal‚Äô and I‚Äôve always been really easily persuaded (it‚Äôs kinda haunted me my whole life in a way, I‚Äôve since been diagnosed with bpd and being on the spectrum idk if that‚Äôs relevant)

All of this is honestly embarrassing to admit or even write out. I constantly wonder if it was somehow my fault because it was going on at the same time and was similar. So yeah idk I‚Äôd love peoples input and opinions ",1,2.0,2024-12-27 10:25:23,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hnc33h/i_need_opinions_ig_be_honest/

1hne301,post,I kind of feel like I'm blowing this out of proportion,"I dated a guy for 7 years, and during that time there were a lot of issues. I can think of one time where we both drank when we lived with his family, and after I passed out I woke up to him having anal sex with me. I kept asking him to stop and he just kept saying ""just until I finish"" while not stopping. It took me raising my voice enough that others might hear me for him to stop, and then he did but he was annoyed and went to sleep. That was probably 6 years ago. More recently, over the past few years, I would wake up to him trying to do the same thing, but if I moved or was obviously awake he would roll over and go back to sleep. The few times he actually did start having sex with me while I was sleeping and I woke up and asked him to stop, I would confront him the next day, and he would say he tried to wake me up and I consented, so he thought it was okay. Not once do I remember consenting. I broke up with him a month ago, and tonight I had a dream where a random guy was following me down the street cat calling me, and then tried to pull me into an alley and assault me. I woke up before anything happened, but now I can't seem to sleep without falling back into that idea of that happening. If I was even assaulted, it wasn't like that, so I don't know why I can't get the thought of something like that happening out of my head. I can't even tell if I was assaulted, if he stopped once I woke up. I had asked him to stop trying walking me up to have sex, I told him if I went to bed that was that, but he kept doing it. But is that even really assault? Am I being crazy? ",1,3.0,2024-12-27 12:43:15,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hne301/i_kind_of_feel_like_im_blowing_this_out_of/
m40wt4y,comment,,"you were sexually assaulted/abused numerous times, i am so sorry and it is not your fault in any way. people NEED to ask for consent before attempting to engage in sexual activity with another person and there needs to be clear sexual boundaries (and boundaries in general) established in relationships. you were asleep, drunk, you said no, cried, and told him to stop, he didn‚Äôt ask for consent at any point, and completely violated/abused you along with lying, gaslighting, and manipulating you. i really recommend seeking out a therapist who works with sexual assault/rape survivors if you‚Äôre able to and here are some resources that i‚Äôm aware of:

m41d24l,comment,,"Hi lovely I hope you‚Äôre doing alright. It‚Äôs so hard to accept that someone you love so much could do something so horrible. If you want to speak to someone then contact https://rapecrisis.org.uk/get-help/want-to-talk/ I found the web chat so helpful

If it‚Äôs helpful, you could hear my story. I left that guy on the side of the road and he called me apologising begging for forgiveness. I forgave him because I still loved him and believed we could make it work. However after rape, there will always be a power imbalance in your relationship. No matter what, during whatever you‚Äôre doing there will be a feeling that you can‚Äôt back out. That‚Äôs not good for you. At first I thought I could cope to be with this guy who I loved so much but it wore me down

There will always be an elephant in the room. Every deep conversation we had afterwards I tried to understand why he did that to me rather than try to get to know him on a deeper level. Rather than trying to understand and sympathise with his relationship with his father, I tried to rationalise how that impacted him and made him hurt me. You will always be thinking about it. You will not be able to recover while you are with him. You might avoid certain topics to avoid conflict, but this means that you can‚Äôt freely discuss boundaries. You may feel that even if you did discuss boundaries that it wouldn‚Äôt matter.

You will not be able to speak to anyone. You will not be able to speak out about the extent of your pain without feeling like you have to hold back to protect your partner. You will not heal. You deserve to heal. You deserve love. They deserve nothing. No matter how good their apology, no matter if they never ever do it again that relationship is not salvageable

Even if they suddenly woke up and we‚Äôre so sorry and not capable of hurting you ever again, that power imbalance will always be present. You will always be aware that at any time they can hurt you. That isn‚Äôt healthy for any relationship. It will impact both you and your partner. You may become overly defensive or hyper aware of their needs or over compensating. This is very confusing for a partner. If they suddenly became a great person, would you want to put them through that? It‚Äôs a natural survival response to when we feel threatened, you will always feel threatened. And however your body responds is out of your control and will impact your partner

For me it didn‚Äôt happen again in the same coercive forceful way, but they will develop more subtle physiological ways to wear you down once they realise that you‚Äôre aware of what‚Äôs happened to you. Once you use the language they use more morally ambiguous tactics that an outside observer and even you may not even notice you‚Äôve been manipulated. You will never be able to have an open and honest conversation about consent and boundaries. And actually, if you feel you can‚Äôt talk about consent openly how do you think your partner would feel? Do you think they want to be with someone they don‚Äôt want to bring up the topic of consent and boundaries around so that they don‚Äôt bring up conflict? Because that‚Äôs not safe. For either of you. Because deep down they know they‚Äôve done something wrong, and they won‚Äôt want to go anywhere near that topic

Think it over. Take some time to yourself. Talk to people!! Talk to your family and friends. Speak out. Trust your gut. You‚Äôre going to be okay. It‚Äôs not your fault. Think of yourself in 5 days, 5 weeks, 5 months and 5 years. I know no one wants to be alone on the holidays but you are so strong and you are going to be okay. You have a life full of love and laughter and this relationship is not necessary to make you feel happy or fulfilled. You can find that within yourself

And no. They don‚Äôt deserve forgiveness. I am a Christian, i believe everyone deserves forgiveness. But that doesn‚Äôt mean you have to stay in a dangerous situation. You can achieve forgiveness more easily if you are not in a situation where you can get hurt

It will never be the same again. You may believe that they made a mistake or that they didn‚Äôt understand. That‚Äôs okay. It‚Äôs okay to not be able to accept what happened yet. Maybe you repressed some memories. Maybe you remember it vividly. But whatever happened, if a boundary has been crossed it will never be able to be the same again. Leave it in the past. Move on and heal. You‚Äôre going to be okay without them

If you can‚Äôt leave for yourself. Leave for the people around you. It will break them to see you become a shadow of yourself. My dad literally said I was a shell of the person I used to be. Staying with them will create a trauma bond and codependency, you will be stuck in fight/flight/freeze/fawn constantly. You may feel that way now, it‚Äôs okay. Take a breath, pray, meditate, talk to someone. Do whatever you need to. Don‚Äôt push these feelings down, your survival instincts are designed to protect you. If you still can‚Äôt leave for yourself, leave for them. It will ruin their mental health and your relationship seeing you fall apart after the aftermath of the rape. They may have their own feelings of guilt and shame (that are their own responsibility, which are not your fault and do not need to be dealt with no matter how much you love them). They won‚Äôt be able to process these feeling while trying to maintain a relationship with you

I would focus on recovery. You have shock, pain, & guilt swirling. How could this happen to you? Why me, why now?  You have certain physical, emotional, and psychological trauma. Please process it with a good friend, mentor, sibling, parent, or counselor. You will feel guilty trusting the wrong person, and not fighting like hell. You may become depressed, angry, or anxious. A friend of mine was assulted, did not deal with it, and became an alchoholic. Please do not clam up, or flip out. It will take time to process but you will get better. Over time the pain will yield. This too shall pass.



Overtime YOU WILL RECOVER. How will you adapt is key. At some point, if you you invest the time, and work on recovery you will return as a stronger and wiser woman.

Two people can also have the exact same experience and have a totally different reaction to it. Some people develop PTSD after an experience with a shooting. Some people don‚Äôt, even though it was the same shooting.

But‚Ä¶ go with the way you feel. If you‚Äôre not feeling destroyed, that doesn‚Äôt mean you have to. I would *highly* suggest talking to a therapist about what you‚Äôre feeling.

I would focus on recovery. You have shock, pain, & guilt swirling. How could this happen to you? Why me, why so long? You have certain physical, emotional, and psychological trauma. Please process it with a good friend, mentor, sibling, parent, or counselor. You will feel guilty trusting the wrong person. You may become depressed, angry, or anxious. Please do not clam up, or flip out. It will take time to process but you will get better. Over time the pain will yield. This too shall pass. 



Overtime YOU WILL RECOVER. How will you adapt is key. At some point, if you you invest the time, and work on recovery you will return as a stronger and wiser woman.

  
You can do better

1hnh35g,post,I have no where else I can talk about this ,"Things I feel the need to mention beforehand: 
massive TW for the content within this post, I go into some detail 
The account used is not my real account nor does it involve my real name anywhere.

I have no where else I can go to talk about what I‚Äôve been through. I haven‚Äôt told my friends, parents, I haven‚Äôt even told a therapist for fear of being looked at differently. I have a long history of people being sexually violent with me, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever had a good experience of sexual conduct even with boyfriends I‚Äôve had. From near encounters with rape, to manipulation and pressure.
I was 16 when I was first sexually assaulted, and before this, I had no experience whatsoever with boys. my best friend at the time had a hard life at home, his parents were abusive and ofc me being 16, didn‚Äôt really know how to help him other than letting him have a place to go so that he could get away from home. He would come round to mine every night pretty much, and it was always friendly, until it wasn‚Äôt, and he confessed his feelings for me, I rejected them and he seemed okay with that, nothing was mentioned again. A month later we were play fighting on my bed and before I knew it, he was pulling down my trousers. He smacked my butt a few times and felt around my vagina before my shouting and struggling made him panic a bit and he stopped. He panicked because I was being loud and my family was home. My first experience of anything to do with sexual conduct was un consenting, in my own home and bed, and by someone I trusted. We of course stopped speaking after that, he then spread a sexual rumor about me at school, which was a real slap in the face considering what he did to me. He confessed to me over text that he had lied and I cleared my name - he then dropped out of my school probably out of embarrassment.
That same year, still 16 I got my first boyfriend. Unknown to me, he had a pretty big porn addiction (he confessed this to me a couple years after we broke up and he apologised for everything. We are on good terms now but we do not talk.) because of his porn addiction he was very hyper sexual, we tried having sex (consensual) but it was too painful for me so we agreed to stop and instead would do other things. Because of his hyper sexual nature, this would often lead to him asking for head sometimes 2-3 times in a 4-5 hour period. If I would say no or express that I didn‚Äôt want to, he would get t angry, give me the silent treatment or cause an argument (and our arguments were bad. Someone was always ending up in tears) and so to stop this from happening I would give in and give him what he wanted‚Ä¶ I got nothing in return. While I consented eventually, I was pressured into it, which imo is not really consent. 
I then took 2 years away from dating after me and him broke up. I had no interest in guys, or sex and at 18 I finally moved to a different city for uni. I moved into a student building where the washing machines were communal and in the common room. Here I met kawak. He was 25 (I found this out after it was too late). We met in the common room while I was waiting on my washing and we talked for a bit, he was nice and because I was freshly 18 in a new city with no friends, I said yes to having his insta because I could maybe make a friend this way. He asked me if I wanted to hang out that night, we agreed on dinner and I told him that I wasn‚Äôt looking for anything romantic, just in case he thought it was a date. I was very explicit in this. He told me to meet me outside his block and I did. He came out, greeted me but ‚Äòforgot his jacket‚Äô I said I would wait while he went and grabbed it. It was the middle of winter at 8pm, in Scotland so it was incredibly cold. He said ‚Äúit‚Äôs too cold for you to wait out here, come up with me while I get it.‚Äù And I stupidly agreed. (I have since learned my lesson don‚Äôt worry). To make a long story of traumatic events short, he locked us in his room, touched my boobs, kissed my neck, forced me to touch his penis, I would shout, hoping to grab the attention of flatmates but unfortunately no one came to my rescue. I would try and push him off me, I would struggle against him, I used my words to express how much I hated what was happening and this man did not care. When he tried to unbutton my jeans and pull them off me I confessed that I was on my period (I was). He told me he didn‚Äôt believe me and continued his assault. When he went to reach inside my pants I grabbed his wrist and said ‚Äúwhen you pull out your hand I swear you‚Äôre gonna get a nasty surprise.‚Äù I guess he sensed my seriousness because he let me go. I grabbed my phone and I left. I blocked him on everything but because we lived in the same building, we ran into each other 3 more times after this night, and he tormented me each time. He would make comments, not caring who was around. The comments were ‚Äúare you still on your period‚Äù while winking at me. He made a joke about getting me drunk. And when I was sat in the common area with my male friend, he walked up to him, put a hand on his shoulder and asked if I was at least ‚Äòputting out‚Äô for him. (My male friend had no idea of what this man had done to me). For context going further: I am 5‚Äô2 and very weak, I am not hard to over power unfortunately. 
I then got my second boyfriend at 18. Between 16 and 18 I had no sexual contact with anyone, I was still inexperienced and my sexual encounters thus far had not been good. This was no different. My boyfriend was so kind to me in the beginning. He made no moves sexually, he let me instigate whatever I wanted to, and hadn‚Äôt pressured me at all into anything. By the time we first had sex, he was already my boyfriend. We were making out in my bed when he asked if I felt ready. I told him no despite me being very turned on and we continued to make out. I thought it was all fine from there. I felt something against me. It was his penis, already out of his trousers and pants and he was pressing it against me. He said ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôm not going to put it in until you say I can‚Äù‚Ä¶ so why is it there? Regardless, he would say things like ‚Äúgod I wish I could be inside you‚Ä¶ you are so beautiful‚Ä¶. This is painful for me‚Äù as would emphasis the hurt he would feel if he didn‚Äôt get some kind of relief. I felt pressured once again, and we had sex. We didn‚Äôt last together too long after that. I later found out he raped someone. I hope she‚Äôs okay and tbh I hope he‚Äôs dead. I then took another year to myself. I‚Äôm a student and work in a nightclub. As you can imagine, drunk men don‚Äôt really care for consent. I‚Äôve been touched out numerous times and my thought process has always been ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been through worse, who cares?‚Äù I‚Äôm desensitised to it, I‚Äôve been followed home, harassed by the same man and I can‚Äôt bring myself to care. Which I think is quite sad and I feel sorry for myself that a 20 year old girl doesn‚Äôt care when taken advantage of because ‚Äòit could be worse‚Äô. 
One night I was working and a man probably in his late 40s grabbed my face and kissed me on the lips. Security got him, took his phone and it was found that he had photos of me. He had taken them of me whiteout my knowledge throughout the night. I told my manager and I made a bit of a joke out of it and he said to me ‚Äúyou seem weirdly calm considering what has just happened‚Äù and I thought to myself ‚Äúwomp womp, shit happens. It could be worse.‚Äù I have an awful view on men. I have 2 men in my life I talk to regularly- one being my boyfriend. I don‚Äôt trust them at all. I often think ‚Äòif they not making me uncomfortable they‚Äôre probably making someone else uncomfortable‚Äô. 
If you read this far then thank you, I appreciate you taking the time to do so. I hope everyone who has ever been through something similar is okay. You‚Äôre so strong and the respect I have for you is insane.

1hnhsst,post,"My rapist is being charged for raping someone else, do I contact the prosecutor ","I recent found out that my rapist is being charge with 10 different charges of rape and sexual assault of another girl when she was drunk. I don‚Äôt know the girl btw. 

I was raped by him in 2019 when I was 17 & he was 18. I was really drunk & he was sober. I filed a police report in 2020 but never followed up because of the emotional strain it would have on my family and myself. 

From the context of what I saw in his case summary it looks like what happened to other girl was much more violent and terrible & I feel absolutely terrible abt what happened to her and guilt for not following through on my case. 

After seeing that he was being prosecuted by the state, I thought that maybe I should contact that prosecuting attorney & provide a statement. I really want to see him get put away & reprimanded for this, however I no longer live in the state. Additionally, I‚Äôm concerned about how much of a commitment it might become if I contacted the prosecutors. I do want to help but I‚Äôm just scared about reliving my trauma and I wouldn‚Äôt want my family or other people from my high school to know what happened to me. 

Sorry this sounds all over the place it‚Äôs been really overwhelming and I‚Äôm just not sure what to do, because I do want to help but I‚Äôm scared, if anyone has some advice.",6,3.0,2024-12-27 15:52:35,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hnhsst/my_rapist_is_being_charged_for_raping_someone/

1hnisgw,post,Im Done. ,"Im sick of being taking advantage of my the people I'm closest to. My best friend a few years around really fucked me up. Cut them out of my life. 

Now my current best friend has been grinding against me when they stay the night and I'm torn between cutting them off and moving away or trying to work things out. I don't know. We had a fwb type setup, but the terms of agreement were explicit permission before things are sexualized each time. 

Despite this I have caught them several times intentionally grinding against me. I already reminded them that it wasn't ok in my sleep I can't consent that way; it is triggering. Seemed to feel bad but not bad enough to fucking stop. 

Telling me shit like they ""just accidentally do it in my sleep and didn't mean to"". Or when they try to tell me I started it which 1. No the fuck i didn't 2. Even if I was moving in my sleep you fucking don't assume you can take your dick out and position it against me. Go fuck yourself. 

I'm just.. done with people. I'm done with excuses. I'm done with sleepovers because I guess fuck my boundaries if I'm vulnerable enough.

1hnj2uc,post,I want to be normal ,"When I was young I had a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù that used to touch on me during sleepovers around the age was 12 (M) he was 13 (M) but athletic im very small for a boy, I never fought back and he ended up coercing me into doing more with his cousin (F) after I accidentally found out about porn on my own 

( I was never interested in sex when I was younger until I saw it for the first time then the sleepovers started ) 

I‚Äôve also encountered people in school the was hyper sexual mainly girls, either touching me constantly or trying to convince me to sneak off with them this was also when i was around that age

When I turned 15 i moved in with my dad & uncle, my uncle was a family person per say and i have a big family my cousins were over so much it seemed like they lived there maybe around 4- 7 ppl in the house half the time, there was a particular cousin that wouldn‚Äôt leave me alone ( im a very antisocial/separate my self type of person) 

She would always try to play fight, excessively to the point other people would notice, but when know one was around she would touch me too so if anyone came close she would pretend to be doing something else she was around 13 (F) 

I didn‚Äôt want to I never did but she was there all the time and it started to happen constantly and one night I gave in a few days after we continued i felt horrible I think most of these events has turned me hyper sexual as I got older I have put my self in positions or doing things with people thinking its what I want just to also feel terrible after (mostly with men since that was my first encounter) but I haven‚Äôt seemed to be right with women either with both genders something is always off and I hate being touched

My LDR bf was coming to meet me for the 2nd time and we decided on some boundaries and rules on kissing, hugging but no oral sex. The week that he came we were doing all that but no oral sex. In that week, he told me lets do oral sex but I wasnt comfortable with doing that. I told him couple of times ""no"" and I dont want to do that. This has been going on for a few days but then yesterday he kept on telling me to lets do it orally. I wasn't interested in it and I told him no again and again. Then I got fed up and told him I could do it if he wears a condom. I gave in and did it, he told me if I felt like I was forced and I said Im okay. He asked me if I wanna recieve oral and I told him Im not interested in it and then he tells me lets do it without the condom this time and I just froze and was getting teary because I didnt wanna do it.

1hnlf34,post,I can't tell if I'm traumatized or not?,"This happened awhile ago, I'm 26 now but I was a teenager at the time, been thinking about it lately but could never tell if this is SA or not. I was in summer school I was sitting with a group of friends and a girl next to me. I was a 16yr old guy she was 15. We all hanged out and laughed for a bit but she started fucking with me by putting her hand on my thigh. She would rub and squeeze my thigh with her hand. I got mad at her but didn't go off at her because I was afraid to be embarrassed. She kept doing this until class was over. I had to hide my boner with my backpack because it was so embarrassing but she kept on giggling/laughing at me, I even begged her to stop while my friends did nothing but she loved embarrassing me. My face was red, sweating, angry at the same time and I wanted to tell the teacher on her but I was scared of embarrassment. After school I masturbated because I thought it would help but I finished with a weak orgasm along with anger/disappointment, I never enjoyed her touching me but I couldn't control my erection. Next day of school she told several people how she gave me a boner and how embarrassing it was for me. Pretty sure those people never looked at me the same after that and I still see them to this day(fucking sucks). I've thought about this thought the years ever since it happened but I didn't think it was traumatizing either. I have severe depression and idk if I'm traumatized by this or not, I did get high last night and for whatever reason this unfortunate moment in my life came back to me.

1hnluva,post,I consented but my boundaries were heavily crossed?‚Ä¶ ,"-Warning for graphic details and a long story!!-

 I (24F) have a fianc√©e (24M)

I've only ever been with my fianc√©e sexually and we were super compatible in bed. I'm kind of adventurous in bed and have some riskier kinks that he's always made me feel safe trying.

I'm not proud of it but when he told me he was talking with his friend about our sex life and the friend (24M) was jealous- I felt good. I've never been the prettiest or the first choice so when someone was JEALOUS I felt so shocked at how much it boosted my confidence. The conversations turned to them talking about me sexually and sharing photos of me (consensually) but turned to the possibility of having a threesome with the friend (MxFxM) and I got a bit scared.

My fianc√©e told the friend that if this was going to happen there would be boundaries and they were not to be crossed under any circumstance. (No face slapping, no seeing my breasts, No anal without prep, no vaginal penetration, and no overly rough sex/bjs, no ass eating) 

Those are my hard boundaries due to some of them being based around trauma (the slapping, and ass eating (I was molested by a family member for a short time when I was 9) and I figured a friend he's had for 18 years wouldn't be untrustworthy.

I said we'd see what happens but I think in my mind I already knew it would. When the friend came over I knew immediately that I was right and drowned my fear in alcohol. I believed it would be okay if the boundaries were followed and hell! Maybe this would be fun. 

I could tell the friend was waiting for me to loosen up so he could make his move. I drank faster to dull the anxiety and fear. Eventually the friend got tipsy and so did my fianc√©e. 

I ended up in just my bra and panties. He's touch me, fondling my ass and grabbing my hips. I was mostly okay with this until he compared me to the women he likes (bigger, bigger boobs, bigger asses) and I felt my confidence drop. I felt like I couldn't say no at this point and just had to push through it. I drank until I couldn't see straight but I still could think somewhat.

My fianc√©e thought I was okay with everything because I said nothing (even he was forcing himself by this point) and we all ended up in the bedroom. The friend ripped my panties off and immediately went to stick his finger in my ass without lube. He got two fingers in before my fianc√© all but forced him to use lube and gave him shit for it.

The friend then tried to get in my bra and both my fianc√©e and I said no. He reluctantly let it go when my fianc√© grabbed his hand but he hadn't much cared for my response.

I focused on my fianc√©e, my safe space and started blowing him to rid my mind of the friend who was behind me and fingering my butt. I guess the friend got jealous of the attention and ripped me from fianc√©e before putting himself in the place my fianc√© was. I tried to get into it and started giving him what he wanted (BJ) while my fianc√©e slipped inside my ass which should've been prepared by now (the friend hadn't prepped me and by that point I was so drunk I couldn't feel anything).

The friend slapped me in the face- HARD- and called me a dirty slut. I froze, I was blank. When I tell you that every trauma response in my body was going, I mean it. I was like a dead body. I was scared he'd hit me again so I did what he wanted and hoped it would be over soon so I could go wash myself off. I could hear my fianc√©e warn him again not to slap me but I was pretty much gone by that point.

The friend apparently got impatient at me and flipped me over the bed like a rag doll before forcing himself in my mouth and thrusting hard and fast and deep like he didn't give a damn about me. His hands were around my throat and he was choking me while my fianc√©e was in my butt on the other side of the bed unable to see how I was faring. 

I tried to scratch at his thigh when I lost air (he had deprived me of air for 30 seconds and I had puked on him but he wouldn't stop) and I eventually passed out which apparently made my fianc√©e freak out and force the friend to stop.

He was so scared and stopped the friend from doing anything else by that point. I woke up to him near tears and apologizing. He had wanted to stop the whole thing from the start but thought I wanted it and didn't want to ruin the night for me (neither of us had been able to communicate our reluctance) 

The night ended with my fianc√©e reluctantly leaving me after I said I was okay and just needed to sleep (the alcohol and lack of air made me so tired but the shock had completely flooded my system. I was shutting down and needed to be alone. I went to the bathroom and sat on the toilet nearly
in tears because I was bleeding heavily from my anus and finally felt all the cuts around and inside it. After I put on some new panties and a liner to catch the blood I crawled in bed. I just wanted to sleep and pretend it had never happened) 

My fianc√©e cut the friend off after and we've had conversations since it happened. He says he's disgusted with himself and he basically just watched his friend rape the love of his life ... but how could I have been raped if I had consented? I'm so torn. I don't know what to think. All I know is that sex hasn't been the same since that night.

I can't touch myself, look at myself in the mirror, sex brings on anxiety attacks, and I hate the idea of anyone in my mouth or ass. I feel like something in me changed that night, and yet I don't think I was raped. But my mother and fianc√©e both believe that I was. I don't know how to move on. I keep blaming myself.

I got drunk. I didn't say no. I consented to some of it. And yet when he says I was raped I start balling because I DO feel violated.",1,2.0,2024-12-27 18:49:26,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hnluva/i_consented_but_my_boundaries_were_heavily_crossed/

1hnmk17,post,I can't tell if I consented or not,"I've (17) been seeing this guy (also 17) for not that long and I feel like it's moving far too fast. At first it felt alright in the sense that we would kiss and it wasn't anything more, but now I swear he just wants to hook up with me and it's honestly freaking me out. We hung out recently (I don't want my friends to find this so I'm leaving out specifics), and he parked the car briefly so we could kiss. The issue is that I have a really big issue where I just can't say no to people, and when he asked to move to the backseat, I agreed. I didn't want to hook up with him, even from the start. I don't even know if I can be mad at him because he asked me several times if I was okay and to tell him if I wanted to stop, and I didn't stay stop. I feel like he did everything right but at the same time I don't. The issue is that I didn't say anything. I just froze and I didn't say no, but I didn't say yes either. The only thing I really found myself able to do was move his hand away once or twice, to which he did and apologized a lot. I want to be able to not blame myself but at the same time I feel like it's all my fault. I really, really regret not saying anything, and I feel like I can't do this if I don't have the basic ability to say ""stop"", ""no"", or anything of the sort. But I also really like him and he is a good guy and I don't want to end things so suddenly. I don't even know if I really want it to end, but I feel like I should for the sake of my mental health. I don't want to know what I could get myself into if I stay but I don't really know if I want to leave. I feel like it's my fault because I've been through sa before; I've always pledged that I would speak out and say no but I didn't, and I can't even bring myself to tell the people I care about about this story.",1,1.0,2024-12-27 19:19:42,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hnmk17/i_cant_tell_if_i_consented_or_not/

m42yq1i,comment,,"I‚Äôm sorry that happened to you. It‚Äôs not so different from a lot of younger girl older guy stories but that does not make it okay. 
When you are older and able to think back I‚Äôm sure it will all be a bit clearer but that hardly helps now‚Ä¶ I guess what I would focus on is if the roles were reversed‚Ä¶ if you were 25 would you be seeking out significantly younger partners? If so ‚Ä¶ why? It‚Äôs been my experience that people who go out of their way to seek out significantly younger partners do so for a reason‚Ä¶ either they take advantage of their partner‚Äôs inexperience or frankly no one their own age would have them. ‚Äú you‚Äôre so mature for your age‚Äù is the anchor they hang around your neck‚Ä¶ if they do anything ‚Äúwrong‚Äù it‚Äôs just because you seem so grown but the min you take something ‚Äúwrong‚Äù it‚Äôs because you are inexperienced and you‚Äôll learn. 
You are allowed to talk to a boy and still say no‚Ä¶ even if that talk was very very explicit. 
You are allowed to kiss and still say no.
You are allowed to engage in some sexual acts and still say no to others.
Hell you can start having sex and halfway through just decide you are not into it and stop. The point of no return is a lie. 

That being said it sounds like this guy knew what he was doing and took advantage of you.  Even if it was just an ‚Äúhonest‚Äù misunderstanding it is NOT your fault. I really want to encourage you to talk to a therapist. They are usually only like 30-50$ a visit if you have insurance and sometimes free. You can usually do it over a zoom session on your phone or in your car or wherever you feel safe but start talking now so when you do feel ready you have someone you trust.
I tried to rely on my friends when I went through something like this and while they could empathize they could not help me out of that place in my life as they were trying to find their way as well.",1,,2024-12-27 19:58:27,t3_1hmq4lw,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hmq4lw/my_fault/m42yq1i/

1hnpcgs,post,Cutting off my mom ,"Just cut off my elderly mother 

So my mom is in her 60s. Her ex husband actually just died. Ive experienced a lot of death in the past few years. I regularly will sob because I know my mother is going to die one day and whenever that is,  that day will be sooner than I think. 

However on two separate occasions I was molested by my next door neighbor. I told my mother about this at 12, I'm now 30. She told me i didn't understand how older gentlemen show affection. 

As I'm older and healing through past trauma, I've begun to unpack this. In unpacking this, I decided to tell my mother how terribly that had hurt me, especially since I was still pressured to go over to his house after that- and I did many times and it left me with very deep and painful shame and  trauma. 

I send her an article on how to respond to adults who bring up their childhood SA, hoping we can have a very different conversation about it 18 years later. She tells me that there was nothing different she could have done and I went over there voluntarily....
 
I don't know how to deal with this grief and this pain. This wound feels brand new and in one way I'm so proud of myself for the depth I'm able to feel in my pain, as I've been numb to it for so long, but on the other hand it hurts so bad ... how have other people dealt with this?

uhm this situation is weird :/ your uncle did step over a line here but he is not the devil, shame on him.  
im really sorry how you feel about it and those emotions are right. alcohol isnt really an excuse but it does have effects. So, would your uncle done it without alcohol? 

As we all agree, SA's are way to much. almost like its a part of humanity that we cant get rid of. sadly.  
i do want to name the problem by its name. because the fantasie we all live happy and behave right seems to far away. 

So, that moment, what happend is definitly weird :/ but dont lose your mind over it. as you look around, alot of werid storys can be seen. maybe you can understand that those situations arent uncommon. I myself too made simular expiriences. We humans are not perfect and we do need to understand this. the question i had for myself is if i can life with those ""mistakes humans do"" and i can.

Your uncle is also probably old, he feels his time is over, he has a family and probably misses beeing young doing what boys like to do. maybe he sliped that night.   
so i want to make clear that i dont protect what  happend and i dont want to play it down. i just want to say he is a human too. he has feelings and emotions. that need to be takin in if you want to think/discusse what happend.  
not doing so and marking him as the problem isnt helping you or him. its just the easiest way -for you- to deal with the problem.   
It was just a weird encounter. i would talk with him. tell him what happend is extremly wrong. he shouldnt lose controll like he did. and that there are reasons for it. (as mentioned he might have a midlife crisis)   
he needs to get his sh\*t together and deal with HIS problems.",1,,2024-12-27 21:25:24,t3_1hma1m4,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hma1m4/what_does_this_count_as/m43eqg0/

I was 15, he was way older. I think it is better to start off with that piece of information. 
He was very manipulative and used to ask sexual favors all. the. time. He might have thought it was some kind of game or freaky thing I liked but he also had a fetish about raping, it was not a big thing in the relationship tho. It lasted till the day we broke up, the night before he was telling me that the next time he‚Äôd see me he‚Äôd touch me even if I said no because he missed touching me so much and bla-bla-bla (he started living in another country at that moment). He used to touch me inappropriately in public spaces without asking me anything. He would say that I was cheating on him and having pleasure with other guys if I didn‚Äôt please him. He would be mad if I didn‚Äôt send him things. But I always ended up doing it so it was not an assault, was it? Maybe I was dumb I don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt know, during the relationship I would‚Äôve laughed if someone told me I was abused, but now I‚Äôm having nightmares about it, i have panic attacks and am absolutely disgusted by sex. I never talked about it to anyone. I need to know, was I sexually assaulted ? ",5,3.0,2024-12-27 22:06:26,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hnqau7/did_my_exboyfriend_assault_me/

1hnqfiu,post,Doubting myself,"I am doubting myself and really struggling right now. 

I had a bad experience with a guy 10 years older than me about a month ago; I planned to be intimate (we met online and sexted), and once we met up and after things started heating up between us, I told him to wear a condom. He did, but then I quickly wanted to stop. I told him I just wanted to lie down since I‚Äôve had some bad experiences before. Then, he started fingering me anally without saying anything and I just laid there. He had sex with my vaginally a few times after that. I‚Äôd tell him to stop, and he would, but then he‚Äôd move me in a different position and start again. Towards the end of the night he was on top of me and I was moving back towards the headboard because, again, I told him i wanted to slow down and not engage in penetration. Instead he pulled me towards him and said I was  ‚Äúdoing a good job‚Äù.  I was pushing his thigh away from me with no success until I finally managed to get him off. this was all without a condom. 

I‚Äôm already in therapy for something sexually traumatic that happened a year ago, and I met with her the next morning. She told me to get a rape kit, and I did. Now, however, I‚Äôm doubting myself so much. Nothing feels real. I feel like I‚Äôve lost all my sanity. Doesn‚Äôt help that I have a ridiculous amount of family shit and other personal stuff happening right now too. 

Does anyone else struggle with perceiving yourself as a bad person who‚Äôs just crazy or attention seeking? I hate being so mean to myself all the time, but I also don‚Äôt know what to do with myself when everything feels too real. :/ so, I turn to Reddit lol",0,2.0,2024-12-27 22:12:08,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hnqfiu/doubting_myself/

1hns18b,post,"I can‚Äôt really say that I was raped, but could I have been groomed? ","He actually told me that he tried to be my friend because of the scars on my arms (I used to be depressed and would cut myself). In the beginning, I hated it when he hugged me. Eventually, he confessed that he knew I didn‚Äôt like it, but he found it amusing that I hugged him anyway, even without wanting to.  

He introduced me to the world of drugs, which I ended up loving. I started to see him as a friend, and he was the first person I told that I was a lesbian. He accepted me for who I was. I became emotionally dependent on him and truly thought I would die if I lost him.  

But after about a year and some months of this friendship, something happened. We were drinking and smoking weed on the roof when my blood pressure dropped. He took me to his bedroom to lie down and touched me. I can‚Äôt remember if I said no that day, but I think I tried to make him stop without hurting his feelings. The next day, he said he wanted to kill himself because of what had happened. I tried to comfort him, told him I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable with it, but said it was okay.  

After that, he started to feel more comfortable touching me whenever he wanted. I would numb myself with drugs. Sometimes, I would close my eyes and pretend it was a girl. This went on for about two months until I started talking to a girl and felt like I was cheating on her.  

I tried to end things for good, telling him we could stay friends, but I couldn‚Äôt continue doing that with him. He was clearly sad about it, tried to change my mind, and kept touching me. At some point, I couldn‚Äôt handle it anymore, so I stopped hanging out with him.

If you have anyone you cannot safely talk to, anyone at all, do it, please. It took me half a decade to tell someone who actually cared about me. 

There are sexual assault hotlines you can go to, such as RAINN at 1-800-656-4673 that you can go to. I doubt a rape kit will help you this long after the attack, but if there‚Äôs anything you know is still on you that can be used as proof, be sure to use it when contacting police if you choose to do so. The best ways to heal from your trauma responses, namely the inability to sleep/stress response when you wake up could be determined if more detail about the assault itself were to be given, but I recommend doing that with a doctor/psychologist/etc. as opposed to here on the sub, but some people may be able to help here.

1hnsaev,post,I'm not sure if something happened in my childhood.,"I dont know if something happened with my uncle when I was little. My mom even asked me because of how he behaves with me and women in general. He really seem the kind of person. 
He is now in his 70s, never had a relationship, always lived in his parents house.

I remember that when I was little (up to 7yo) him trying to convince me to sleep in his room (two beds) instead of sleeping in the bed w my grandparents when I was sleeping in their house. We used to watch Popeye before going to sleep but I think we might have watched something else as well. And he kept videotape porn in the living room. 
He had naked girls calendars and he was using as an excuse that he was a mechanic and that's normal and needed in the environment (had the garage in their land near the house). 
He always wanted me to sit in the garage office with him. He wanted to show me things he bought and gift me things to feel like he was important in my life. He was always caressing my hair saying how women should have long hair, and if I wasn't eating he was saying it's cause I wanted to be a model (I hated them). I remember once during the holidays I got out of the house and got in my parents' car (I just wanted to be alone as I hated being in their house) and he got out and tried to open the car for a bit (I locked myself into it and hid). He s really slimy and had always made weird uncomfortable misogynistic comments even to my mom and grandmother. 
During the years I stopped talking to him to a point in which I wasn't even going to their house anymore or saying hi from the car if we had to drop in something.

I'm really upset. I was sexually assaulted quite a few times later in life. I'm in therapy (4 years tot on and off, now w a systemic-relational approach) and I'm trying to properly elaborate on the SAs cause I developed a fear and a hate of men that consumes me a lot.

Or maybe try to take some sleep aids as a temp bandage till you could figure out how to access therapy/other ways to heal from your trauma. Melatonin helps with sleep. As does Tylenol pm.

m443dbn,comment,,"The problem with the police may be that they don‚Äôt care/are lazy, but it could also be that, depending on the exact content of the video/s, they can‚Äôt prove it wasn‚Äôt consensual. People make rape and ryona porn consensually for money. I would suggest you work out, get into self defense classes, avoid places that make you feel particularly unsafe(if you can) and look into other ways to make yourself feel tougher as well as ways to quell your anxiety. White noise, ASMR etc.(be careful about ASMR though, if he was whispering in your ear or anything during the attack, it might trigger a trauma response like flashbacks or something else) and something that worked for me in particular was wearing my pain like a badge. I was raped again and again for three years, and when it was all over I adopted certain mannerisms and habits on top of the anger issues I already had to make myself feel like a bigger predator than the man who hurt me. That‚Äôs the path I don‚Äôt want you to take. Getting stronger and tougher may truly help, but don‚Äôt let him take over your personality.

so with my ex, we initially agreed to not have any intimacy until marriage. however, after numerous assaults, we reached the point where I was consensually performing sexual acts such as oral and using hands. but we did not have sex and I made it VERY clear to him that I did not want to have sex and that the things we did do only happened because he made them happen. but when we would get together and begin to be physical, he would pretty much always spend the entire time trying to make me agree to having sex and when I would refuse (to the point of crying and screaming while he held me down while he said he was going to do it) he would just kind of give up and not give me any aftercare, often making me go walk around or drive immediately after when I told him I wasn't ready. I know this stuff was obviously wrong, but is it considered sexual assault because he didn't DO any physical thing that we hadn't before.

Sexual assault is any unwanted contact in a sexual way. I think you already agree that you‚Äôve been sexually assaulted. Rape is typically defined as sexual assault that includes penetration. They‚Äôre both illegal, immoral and traumatizing things, one is just a specific type of the other.

Plus there‚Äôs the fact that you were a minor, so there would be absolutely no way you could consent to anything along those lines. I‚Äôm basically just giving general legal definitions here, because most of us here would agree that anyone who commits any of these offences is a garbage person and deserves to be behind bars, or worse. It‚Äôs not like one thing is worse than another, even if the law says otherwise, it‚Äôs all bad stuff.

In the eyes of the law, anything done to a child would be multiple offences, and one could even say that ‚Äúalone time‚Äù sounds like kidnapping and confinement because you were taken to a place where a caring guardian would never want you to be if they knew that what was going on wasn‚Äôt in your best interest.

I guess there isn‚Äôt a way to know what happened to you unless you got hypnosis or something, or if memories return over time, or if the loser confesses if you confront him. 

And on that note, and finally, it sounds like you‚Äôre still quite young and in some places and in some cases you can still have him criminally and / or civilly charged. If you think you can still catch him on video or audio admitting to anything that he did, you may be able to pursue it and maybe find out more about what happened.",1,,2024-12-28 01:35:44,t3_1hntwd0,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hntwd0/was_this_rape/m44l2ch/
1hnupwo,post,My dad SA‚Äôd me multiple times. ,"Yeah so my dad (40M) keeps on SA‚Äôing me (15M), i‚Äôve told him to stop in the past yet he wont. He keeps on doing it again and again. 

(This wasnt r*pe, he just touches me in intimate places without my consent.) 

I‚Äôve never realized that my dad SA‚Äôd me, until a friend of mine on discord mentioned she was a survivor, when she said SA, i thought she meant rape, but she taught me that SA doesnt always have to be rape. 

Following this event, i started researching and alot of the shit dad does to me is SEXUAL ASSAULT!

E.G: 

1. Argument between my dad and sister get heated, I intervene and defend so he doesnt hurt my sister (he‚Äôs abusive), so the most logical thing he can do is start beating me infront of the whole family while grabbing my chest (i used to be fat so i had man boobs) and pinching. 

2. I‚Äôm in the kitchen grabbing water, dad slaps my ass claiming ‚Äúhe was trying to slap my thigh.‚Äù The ‚Äúnormal‚Äù ass rubs, touches and hits. 

3. Just being a creep in general, i‚Äôve caught him staring at my armpits when i‚Äôm asleep (caught him when i woke up), staying in my room even tho i need to put on some clothes after coming out of the shower, and barging into my room while changing and not leaving. 

Context: we‚Äôre borh Egyptian/Australian living in the UAE, he‚Äôs a ‚ÄúVERY‚Äù religious person and I‚Äôm trying to get closer to my religion but he weaponizes it and now i struggle to find faith. I cant call the police so i dont risk us getting deported. I have lots of info and stories on my situation on other posts. 

Was this SA or am i overreacting? ",1,1.0,2024-12-28 01:38:21,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hnupwo/my_dad_sad_me_multiple_times/

m44q7wf,comment,,"You very well could be traumatized from this, but I would recommend looking further into it. Just because it gave you an erection doesn‚Äôt mean it wasn‚Äôt assault. (Myself for example) was aroused when being assaulted, even though I hated it. Even if you don‚Äôt like it, your body will react the way that it ‚Äúshould‚Äù with sexual acts. That‚Äôs about my understanding with that. 

Do you think that this event still affects your day to day life, if not does it come back to you every once and awhile. Does it affect you when it comes to being around girls and relationships? Does the memory still bother you?",1,,2024-12-28 02:08:57,t3_1hnlf34,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hnlf34/i_cant_tell_if_im_traumatized_or_not/m44q7wf/

m44rl8i,comment,,"After getting out of a possible sexual abusive relationship, I still doubt myself like crazy, even with all of the evidence and the memories that there is. It‚Äôs something that‚Äôs normal. I think that‚Äôs the ‚Äúdenial‚Äù stage of grief. Sometimes you‚Äôll go back to denying everything, because I think that‚Äôs just a way that our mind tries to numb the pain. 

If this helps, with my experience, I was sexually assaulted numerous times by my ex, and I still deny everything. People around me tell me that it was sexually abusive and everything, but I still doubt that it was that intense. It doesn‚Äôt help that my ex activity denies everything to everyone (even though I have proof of them admitting that they assaulted me). But, that doesn‚Äôt ever take away from the fact that serious offenses happened. 

Obviously, your therapist is taking this very seriously. Keep that in mind. She very clearly told you that you need a rape kit, because I‚Äôm sorry, but he clearly raped you several times throughout that night. And you *do not deserve that.* After getting a rape kit, go to the police if you want to report it, because they will take this seriously. I promise. I hope you have great success and recovery.",1,,2024-12-28 02:18:00,t3_1hnqfiu,,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hnqfiu/doubting_myself/m44rl8i/

m44s9y6,comment,,"Right away, an immediate ‚Äúyes‚Äù is consent. If you don‚Äôt respond, that is a *NO.* Moving your hand away is also a no. It shows that you are uncomfortable. 

If you want to work this out with your boyfriend, you can be completely honest and clear with him how you feel about moving too quickly, how you felt about this specific event, and so on. Depending on how he responds to this, you either get the hell out, or you can stay. The option is yours.

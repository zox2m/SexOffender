1hn10sn,post,Federal Prison - What does the release date look like (Massachusetts)?,"We are three months out from my partner being released from federal prison (FMC Devens in MA) and I know it’s going to be here before we know it. 

Can anyone share their release day experience? I’m just trying to mentally prepare. 

Is the expectation that he immediately reports into probation? Our house is in a small town and I was thinking it might be nice to stay at a hotel in the city that first night and go out to dinner. Is that allowed? 

Context: 
- He will have been down for 2.5 years
- He opted out of HWH/HC so this is his actual release date
- He will be released on a Friday 
- His charges were in DC and were equivalent to state charges, but since DC doesn’t have their own prison system, he was sent to Federal (not sure if this affects anything on the probation end)
- His three years of supervised release was suspended, but he has two years of supervised probation (I’ve heard conflicting reports about what this means)
- Probation is currently being transferred from DC to Massachusetts (where his family is located and where we have purchased a house)

1hmh2rb,post,Education Advice!,"Hello! My husband is a R.S.O. 
His charge is over 7 years old. He was in prison for about 3.5 years, got out with no parole or probation but does have to register annually. It was literally the first and last time he has ever gotten in trouble, or so much as a ticket. We also live in Texas. 

We are expecting a baby soon and he really wants to go back to school. He was almost finished with being an Aviation Mechanic but with the strict guidelines of the TSA, neither of us think he will ever be able to get hired for it. Is this something he could ever do? He’s always had a passion for it, but he doesn’t want to waste more time on it if he won’t be able to actually pursue a job in that field.

If he is not able to pursue that job, what kind of career should he pursue? He doesn’t want to go the trade school route if he doesn’t have too, but neither of us are seeing much of another option.

1hm9bap,post,Confused wife,"So my husband is in jail, he told me that him and the boys had a little therapy sesh with each other. I guess they talked about  the feelings that men have and the feelings that they were feeling that led them to do what they did and you know a little Pow Wow to talk about women and etc etc... the thing that bothers me was that my husband said that him and a lot of the men said they did what they did because they felt unappreciated and little self-worth and things like that. What gets me is how do those feelings lead you to mess with somebody that you know is a minor? Is it the sense of excitement the sense of knowing you shouldn't be doing it but doing it anyway? The sense of feeling like you have the power? Was she laughing at all his stupid jokes things like that I'm not sure.

1hlvwkp,post,"Need help, new in Florida","Hello, I don't know where else to turn since everywhere is shut down due to Christmas. I just want to enjoy the holidays but I'm stressed out because my situation is far from clear.

I did 4 months of a 5 month sentence for 1 count of viewing CSM while in the military, went to Charleston south Carolina to serve my time. The entire time they made it sound as if I was going to register, and then 2 weeks out from leaving the man they have figure out your legal stuff sent a liason to tell me ""It looked like I wasn't going to have to register."" And mind you, my situation was weird because I was going back to Georgia for a bit to out process, and it seems like I wouldn't have to anywhere but maybe Florida. 

I tried to clarify the Florida thing since they never got back to me, but it seems like they didn't come address me because I was clear? But then I'm here psyching myself out trying to study Florida law (been here about 24 hours as of this post) but I haven't had to register anywhere. I had Florida as my home address so they were supposed to register me out of Charleston if I had to, but also it IS Florida and I know they're super harsh on it. I tried calling a few places today but most of them wouldn't pick up, the one local sheriffs office lady was nice enough but didn't seem to understand my situation and simply said I wasn't on the register (which doesn't help me because I haven't had to register elsewhere so obviously I wouldn't be). 

Any advice would be nice, I doubt anyone has had remotely this sort of confusion around their case. Unfortunately not living in Florida is not an option as my family is here and has graciously accepted me and my situation, so we will make the best of it even if I have to register.

So they don't require registration if original conviction State still requires it-- only of the state you are moving from requires it.

The holidays are such a special time to slow down and appreciate the things that matter most in life—family, love, and togetherness. Whether you’re surrounded by loved ones today or connecting from afar, let’s take a moment to treasure those relationships that bring warmth and meaning to our lives.

Family isn’t always about blood—it’s about the people who support us, make us laugh, and stand by us through thick and thin. If you’re spending today with your chosen family, friends, or even on your own, remember how special and important you are.

Take a deep breath, soak in the magic of the season, and let gratitude fill your heart. May your day be full of love, joy, and maybe a little too much good food!

Merry Christmas, everyone. Wishing you and your loved ones peace, health, and happiness today and always.

1hkqbgr,post,Upset with the justice system,"I find myself in a challenging situation as I navigate the complexities of what my partner and, in turn, I am facing. My partner has been charged with multiple counts of possession of child pornography, and the prosecuting attorney is unwilling to consider anything less than a nine-and-a-half-year sentence. What troubles me is that this decision is based on my partner's choice to exercise his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent during his interrogation. The prosecutor has informed his attorney that they will conduct a more thorough investigation of his device to uncover any additional material that could lead to further charges if he declines the plea deal and opts for a court trial. Before this incident, he was a law-abiding citizen who contributed positively to society. While what he viewed was wrong, he did not communicate with or attempt any interaction with anyone underage. He deserves punishment, of course, but I disagree with the extent of that punishment.

I have spent countless hours researching various sex crime cases handled in this county, examining the roles of defendants, judges, prosecutors, and defense attorneys, as well as the outcomes of these cases. There appears to be no consistent rationale behind the plea offers made by this prosecutor. I am appalled by some of the lenient deals she has extended to certain defendants, especially when police reports indicated a high likelihood of reoffending. I have documented instances where these individuals did re-offend as registered sex offenders. Yet, they received light sentences, making it highly improbable that they would refrain from committing further sexual crimes.

This attorney's actions have ignited a passion within me, prompting me to pursue a career change and return to school to obtain additional degrees this year to enter law school by 2026. I want to advocate against unjust sentences. Due to his actions, I face the prospect of losing my partner for a significant period since there are no proper guidelines for these types of crimes, and decisions are often based more on perception. I can’t fathom how a convicted murderer with an extensive criminal record can receive 11 years for DUI manslaughter while an individual can receive almost the same amount of time when the state is the only victim listed.

 Additionally, I want to clarify that I am not downplaying the severity of what has occurred; that is far from my intention. As a survivor of these types of crimes, the pain inflicted by my partner's actions has forced me to reflect deeply on many aspects of my life. While there are indeed monsters among us, not everyone fits that description. Many individuals have served their time, transformed their lives, and have no desire to re-offend because they have received the help they need and worked on themselves for the better.

  
additional \*\*\*

  
I recognize several valid points from everyone’s perspectives, and since my previous comments were more of a rant, I didn’t elaborate on some aspects I shared. The DUI comparison was based on a personal experience, as my biological father received an unusually lenient sentence. A man in his 60s went to a bar, engaged in sexual relations with a 26-year-old woman, and tragically killed her through his reckless actions. His criminal record was extensive, with points accumulating in the upper hundreds. For a premeditated murder of two individuals years ago, he served only five years, followed by numerous offenses after his release. He was a domestic abuser, a thief, a liar, and a cheat. He even attempted to set a house on fire with a woman and children inside, receiving just 11 months in jail. This is why I made that comparison.

 

If we advocate for a registry that encompasses all sex crimes, why not create one for domestic abusers, child abusers, murderers, and others? Many calls I went out on could have been avoided if the other party had been informed of prior behaviors.

 

Horrific acts have been committed against children, and I do not wish to downplay that, especially since I have a history of being abused. My abuser faced no consequences and lost nothing. It’s distressing to know that someone enjoyed the material related to my abuse (and still can) and then confronted me about it in my hometown as an adult, telling me their disgusting thoughts. Nevertheless, I recognize that not everyone is inherently evil, and punishments should be just. I never claimed my partner doesn’t deserve some time and psychological help; I believe in both. Our lives have been irrevocably altered because I choose to support him. I am not blinded by love; there are issues he must confront for us to succeed.

 Have you ever wondered why there is an increase in these types of charges? We are inundated with pornography and inappropriate images. A simple search on mainstream porn sites can lead to links that direct users to child sexual abuse material! The content produced often features young women (legal teens) or fantasies that can lead individuals down troubling paths. I have encountered graphic images of child sexual abuse while browsing different communities as basic as recipes online, leaving me in shock and disgusted.

I am frustrated because justice is not as blind as we like to preach. After years of working in social services and advocating for others, I am shifting my career because I can no longer tolerate the inequities I witness. Many people remain silent about injustices, either conforming to the status quo or allowing one bad apple to spoil the bunch for everyone else.",10,34.0,2024-12-23 15:38:44,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1hkqbgr/upset_with_the_justice_system/

I'm not planning on fighting anything and I do have a long history of mental health issues and am on a few mental health medications, have been to therapy for a long time before but stopped a couple years ago, so I know that it would benefit me and I'm hoping a treatment program would too as I do want to change, but I'm aware therapists are mandatory reporters so I just don't know how to go about all this.

Does anyone have experience attending in-person college classes at a university?  I have applied and been accepted to multiple schools in the state (Washington), and had my admission revoked weeks before starting classes.  To be clear, nothing in my conditions prohibit me from attending in person classes. My therapist and probation officer both agree that it would be good for me to have more contact with people, and college-aged people isn't a risk factor for me.

I am 31 years old and currently working programming embedded systems (i.e. writing code for things that are not computers).  I have significant college experience from before I was arrested.  I feel under-credentialed for the work I am doing, and world love to learn more about programming and electronics.

For additional context: I have a hands-on offense against young minors.  I have discussed attending college with my probation officer, along with the possibility that I may share a class with running-start students.  It was agreed that simply being in a class with 16-17 year old students wouldn't be an issue as long as I took steps to minimize direct contact with the minors.  
  
Unfortunately, the universities I applied to have determined that I would only be eligible for online classes, and they do not offer Computer Engineering as an online program.

But as the night wound down I decided to just leave and hit a local bar just to sit and maybe try and socialize. Well sitting there I heard a group say that they felt creeper out and was extremely uncomfortable and me and my red alert bells went off. I ended up just leaving my drink at the spot I was sitting at and left. I have no idea If they were talking about me or not I really was not anything but looking at youtube on my phone like half the bar was also doing. I hoping I was just overthrowing it but will probably never go back again because of it. Just a Lil vent out since I really have no one to talk to about it. ,33,5.0,2024-12-21 20:57:12,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1hjizvv/i_attempted_to_go_out/

1hjeg09,post,When I was sentenced.,"My lawyer had just made submissions for my case and it was the prosecutors turn to make submissions and recommend a sentence, I was waiting for him to destroy me and it was probably the most daunting moment of my life. He started with ""this has been one of the most difficult cases of my career"" at this point I was ready but then he said ""the only thing I can say is the guidelines are clear and there is a community expectation"" then he talked about how he didn't recommend a custodial sentence. I felt like I was waiting for a punch that never came. When the magistrate was summarising before tell us the sentence he said ""the law has taken this decision out of my hands"" and ""I don't believe prison is the right place for you but I can't give you anything else"" 

My sibling was waiting in the gallery and my heart sank when he read the sentence ""10 months for Possession of Child abuse Material"" ""14 months for dissemination of Child abuse Material"".  I was prepared for a multiple year sentence prior to going to court, but my dropped into my stomach when he said that. At which point he says that it's an aggregate sentence and I have a non-parole period of 2 months(statutory parole at 2 months so I'll only spend 2 months in jail). 

I was taken away by the police (the station and the court house were joined) and put into a holding cell and the weight of the previous 10 months was gone, I finally knew what was going to happen. Prison was no biggie, we don't have paperwork in South Australia. During the entire time on bail and in prison I was waiting for someone to jump me, I thought people would come to my home to hurt me and my family and at the end the only negative interaction I had during the whole process was with the first lawyer I spoke too, who had already made his opinion about me prior to meeting me (I don't blame him, I saw my own self-esteem reflecting back at me through this man).

This really doesn't have a point but I just wanted to get it out.",27,4.0,2024-12-21 17:21:37,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1hjeg09/when_i_was_sentenced/

1hi9it5,post,Boyfriend got blindsided at court and sent to prison (UK),"My boyfriend got charged with possession of IOCC about 3 months ago (\~250 images, all classes), house got raided in Feb 2023. First time offense, never gotten in trouble with the law before. He's been super compliant with everyone and has done everything that's been asked of him thus far. His solicitor, probation officer, and pre-sentencing therapist all agreed that prison would be a very, very unlikely situation, so nobody prepared him for it. They all thought he would be a great candidate for rehabilitation and wanted to aim for a community sentence instead.

He had Magistrates Court last month (which went find and they even debated sentencing him there) and Crown Court today. I got the awful call nobody wants to get. He was sentenced to 8 months in prison. He'd have to serve 4 in prison then 4 in the community. Everybody is in shock. Nobody expected this to happen. Nobody has been in contact with him or knows where he is currently.

I don't know what to do. We are in a long distance relationship (I'm in the United States) so I feel especially helpless. I want to be there to support him as much as possible still, I love him and I know he feels so much remorse for what he's done, so please no comments about leaving him.

However ... 

I'm depressed. And I can't figure out why. I'm grateful AF to be home. I don't miss prison at all.

Sadness, fear, anxiety, missing my partner, missing home, you name it. I had to bottle all of it up, and now my brain doesn't know what to do with the gratitude, appreciation, and happiness of being home.

1hhdxpv,post,I need to get it out,"Hi all

First, let me just say that I am happy this group exists. I'm obviously not happy at the fact it *has* to exist but the fact it does, warms my heart.

I'm in Scotland. I was arrested last year, in August, for falling foul to a vigilante group. I will say that I didn't speak to this person first, and I didn't do it due to their age. It started as a 23 year old guy (I'm an openly gay male) who contacted me, and the conversation went from there. As soon as they said what age they were pretending to be at the outset, I should've canned it there - but me being the arrogant muppet I am - I continued to chat to them because I figured ""hey, well, I know you're a group so I'm gonna annoy you and hopefully make you go away"" which spectacularly backfired on me.

I will state that I have a personal dislike of vigilante groups. I don't dislike the basic concept of the groups but as a victim myself from years ago, I hate the entertainment value of it all, the virtue signalling and profiteering some undertake in the name of ""protection"". Do not take that as a ""they shoudn't be doing it at all"" comment, but moreso that rules should be followed and for the right reasons. Personally, I'd rather the person in my past had been brought to justice, not paraded for entertainment value.

I was found guilty of 1x attempt to communicate with a minor. The evidence presented against me was doctored, manipulated and had I been given a proper chance to see it all, I'd have argued it but I didn't - was only when I was at my trial did I see what was being presented as evidence.

I know this looks like I'm moaning about the whole thing and trying to minimise my crime - I know that I'm a muppet for continuing and trying to be ""smarter than I am"", and I accept the verdict while I don't agree with it. The consequences of that are abundantly clear to me now - moreso the fact that *yes* it could have been a minor and not a group, and that it could have caused some real psychologial damage to them had I been wrong. I know that I should have stopped talking to them but my own arrogance got in the way.

16 months this has gone on for - from arrest to sentencing and it's been a tough time. All of it lost in the blink of my eye, and yet it's opened my eyes to a lot of factors, especially my own behaviours. I am going to be sentenced tomorrow and realising that I have literally lost everything because of my own stupidity has really hit me hard.

Again, I'm not dismissing my conviction. I just feel that I can't write my story or talk about it.

Right now, I just don't know what to do.



EDIT:

So I was sentenced (after a bit of a mix up) - I wasn't given a SHPO, or any internet/behavioural restrictions but 12 months supervision with counselling conduct requirement and 250 hours of unpaid work.

1hgxe3b,post,3 Weeks Until Sentencing,"Hey all, long time lurker, first time poster. See the end of post for TLDR.

I have been lurking in this thread for the last 10 months or so, on my main, and have learned so much. I appreciate everyone that has taken time to post, respond and uplift others as I have learned so many things.

For my story, my home was raided in March 2023 following a tip from my partner at the time, leading to an eventual arrest in May 2023 for possession. I initially was indited on 5 counts of possession of CP, third degree felonies in Texas. I spent 8.5 months in county jail until a bond reduction in January 2024. From there, I moved in with some close friends, got a job in April 2024 and was productive. In June 2024, I was hit with ""Possession with intent to distribute"" a second degreed felony based on forensic evaluation. At this moment, my close friends kicked me out of their home as they felt I had been deceitful and could no longer trust me. I spent a six weeks in motels and AirBnB's until the judge allowed me to move home, in a neighboring state, to await the outcome.

This is not a federal case, but state (Texas).

I am a mental health professional with multiple degrees in Psychology. Additionally, I was about to return to the US Army as a mental health professional before all of this popped off. I am currently in the Individual Ready Reserve (IRR) and navigating notifying the Army and Texas Board of Psychology about the situation.

In November 2024, my court-appointed attorneys advised me to take a plea deal of 10 years and lifetime registration. I was able to convince them, and the assistant DA, down to 8 years, given my background and never being justice-system involved. Given the second degree (possession with intent to distribute), it is mandatory lifetime registration per Texas law.

On January 7th, I will surrender and be sentenced. I'm looking for advice on how to navigate the TDCJ system as a gay/pan/bisexual ""child sex offender,"" and what I should expect. I've heard that TDCJ is overcrowded and ""non-violent"" offenders are being offered Parole at 35% which would make me eligible for parole at just over 2 years (minus the 8.5 months I spent in county). I recently looked up someone I was in County Jail with who was sentenced 20 years for solicitation of a minor under the age of 13 (2nd Degree Felony) and 5 counts of possession (3rd degree) and his ""eligible for parole"" date is 2.5 years after his initial incarceration, meaning, he would serve about 15% before eligible for parole. (The math is: arrested in June 2023, spent time in county until his sentence and sent to TDCJ in 9/2024, establishing that he has spent \~15% in jail/prison before eligibility.)

***TLDR:*** So, all this to say, I'm looking for guidance on how to prepare myself as a gay/bisexual, military-affiliated ""child sex predator"" in TDCJ; guidance on transferring parole (interstate compact) to another state from Texas; guidance on things to look forward to after my time in prison; career paths for a military-affiliated, professional, and establishing romantic relationships after prison as a gay/pan/bi person.

1hgv6a2,post,"ACTION ALERT: The Safe Shelters Act: Unsafe, Unjust, and Cruel","***Citizens concerned about this bad policy are encouraged to take action at*** [***The NARSOL Action Center***](https://actionnetwork.org/letters/the-safe-shelters-act-unsafe-unjust-and-cruel-legislation)***.***

When families face emergencies and are driven from their homes, they need quick and equitable access to emergency facilities. Families should be allowed to stay together during crises. However, a new bill, *The Safe Shelters Act*, proposed by Nancy Mace, a former South Carolina state representative who is now a U.S. congresswoman, seeks to deny this fundamental right to families with a member on a state sex offense registry. “Women and children deserve safety,“ she has said in defense of the bill. While protecting vulnerable populations is a goal we all share, this bill fails to achieve that and instead imposes unnecessary harm.

# About the Safe Shelters Act

Mace’s legislation, the *Safe Shelters Act*, states: *“Except for the purpose of seeking information on designated shelters, a covered sex offender may not enter or use the services of an undesignated shelter.*”

Under the proposed bill, “designated shelters,” as determined by FEMA, would likely include federal buildings or prisons deemed suitable for registrants by the General Services Administration. **This bill is cruel and unfairly targets registrants with families**, particularly those with small children. Non-registered spouses depend on their partners for help and support during emergencies, and registered single parents would be made to choose between their children’s safety and forced separation. We believe that requiring families to separate during a crisis is contemptible.

# Why We Oppose the Safe Shelters Act

People on the registry already face ostracization and discrimination in daily life. Denying them access to emergency shelters further marginalizes them and interferes with the fundamental unit of society—the family. No family should have to endure such treatment during a crisis.

**This bill is unnecessary** as there is no evidence that registrants pose a threat to the safety of others in emergency shelters. Shelter operators and agencies are not advocating for such extreme measures. Instead, this bill appears to be a political maneuver—either for publicity or personal agenda—addressing a problem that does not exist.

Ironically, the bill comes from lawmakers who champion limiting government and federal interference in state matters. **This legislation contradicts those principles by overstepping states’ rights**, a fundamental conservative value. The *Safe Shelters Act* undermines this principle because local governments typically manage emergency shelters, and some states have chosen to legislate these matters themselves. The bill overrides state and local authority, imposing unnecessary federal control.

This is **bad public policy on all fronts,** as it harms families by forcing separation during emergencies. It addresses a problem that does not exist, wasting legislative resources. Finally, it violates states’ rights and local jurisdiction over shelter management.

# The Safe Shelters Act Places Families at Direct Risk of Harm

The [**National Association for Rational Sexual Offense Laws** ](https://www.narsol.org/)monitors such legislation and recently called attention to problems around these kinds of laws in states like Florida, Georgia, and North Carolina during recent Hurricanes Helene and Milton, stating, “When safety is threatened, when families are driven from their homes, they need to be allowed emergency shelter just like every other citizen, and they need to be allowed to stay together as families.” NARSOL noted several families electing to stay home during mandatory evacuations rather than separating parents from children, putting entire families in danger.

This flawed, unnecessary, and potentially unconstitutional legislation must not become law. Instead of dividing families during crises, policymakers should focus on solutions that equitably support all citizens.

# A Call to Take Action

Citizens concerned about this bad policy are encouraged to take action at [The NARSOL Action Center](https://actionnetwork.org/letters/the-safe-shelters-act-unsafe-unjust-and-cruel-legislation). If prompted use ""Emergency Management"" as the message category which is for tracking purposes only and doesn't go to your representative.

I truly don't think I will ever feel secure  again with him and I don't feel that's fair to either of us.  It's hard because I hate talking about negativity with him because I know where he is is hard but everyday is him complaining or talking about how he is ready to get out and everything will be back to normal,   but nothing will be normal.

1hgkgtb,post,I am a disabled female RSO. Read my story here. ,"
I am a female registered sex offender (Tier 1, 10 years req) for a crime I did not commit. Here is my story, exhibiting how broken the justice system is, and how the current laws in my state are ill-designed and punish victims of sexual crimes. 

I graduated from University top of my class (BSc, MSc). My very first job was as a teacher at a school for challenging teens/gang members/ etc. I worked there in total for 1.5 months before I was arrested with almost 30 counts of various minor/sexual accusations against me. It has been four years that I have been fighting the charges with almost $1 million in legal fees paid out. 

To summarize: I have autism that requires substantial assistance. The school was supposed to assign me an assistant to help me navigate the classroom and for protection. I was not given one and left in classroom of ~30 16-17 year olds on my own. It was absolute chaos; walking on the tables, fighting, glued to phones, refused to complete work, and importantly for this story, theft. A group of four male students (15-17 year old) stole my purse and phone multiple times and I would not see my things until they magically appeared on my desk at the end of the day. The school had no safe place for my things. I made multiple reports to HR that my phone and purse were stolen every time it occurred. Sometimes I would chase after these boys and try to get my things back but they would laugh and refuse. 

Within 3 weeks, I was being sexually harassed in the classroom by the boys. They would sit around my desk and attempt to grab at my private areas (reminder this was during Covid and we were all required to wear masks and keep distance). I would tell them no and remove myself to another part of my room. I also reported this to HR, stating that I was beginning to fear for my safety and my life as these boys were becoming more aggressive, physical towards me and that they kept talking to me about the guns they had; I needed help. HR replied that because the students were not employees, they could not help me and I would have to “figure it out on my own”. For a brief moment, the boys were suspended from school for gang-related activities that included guns and violence at a school event. 

I went to an after-school teachers meeting and broke down sobbing, letting all of the teachers know of my numerous reports and pleas for help. Many other female teachers stated they had filed sexual assault/harassment complaints against the same boys but the school refused to help them/ told them the same thing. A few days later, one of the boys stayed between classes and sexually assaulted me. He choked me and pinned me against my chair while trying to take pics, using his legs to spread my legs apart and using his fingers to penetrate me. The leader of the group came in with the next class and saw me crying and took pictures of the choke marks around my neck. He told me for $300, he would “take care of him” and I felt I had no other choice, so I wired him the money for protection. 

The leader of the gang (8 boys in total who accused me, only 4 I have ever met) is the person who stole my stuff all those other times (forgot to mention this). He gave me protection from the others while I was on campus and none of his friends bothered me anymore. He came asking for more money. I didn’t know what to do. I decided that perhaps I could hire him and a couple of his friends for a moving job and I would pay them for the service. I had them contact their parents and provide me with the approvals (as outlined by the school rules). Once at my home, the boys held me down and I was raped by each of them. It was incredibly traumatic. I didn’t even fight it, I dissociated completely and just laid there. Afterwards, I didn’t even talk. I just…left. I don’t remember how they got home, how I got home, where I was. I still remember nothing, it’s been completely blocked out. 

The next day at school, I caught the leader attempting to make a multi-thousand $$ purchase using my Face ID. Then everything just fell into place. The random purchases I couldn’t explain of luxury goods (I would cancel the orders and thought my credit cards had been compromised). I yank my phone out his hands and I had a complete mental breakdown in front of the entire classroom. I told him I was reporting everything to the police and I couldn’t take it anymore. He left. Within 30 mins, I was being escorted off campus and arrested. All 8 members of this group went to the principal and accused me of raping them, sending nudes, sexually grooming them, and so so much more. The media went wild. My face and name went National. 

Fast forward in time and I am working with my lawyers on the case. I was presented with things I had no idea existed. Somehow they managed to register their FaceID into my phone and had scoured my phone for my nudes, which they had sent out to many many students. There was also multiple threads of sexual messaging and a lot of bestiality content. They were pretending to be me. The time stamps are all occurring during school time and the vocabulary and emojis used support this (as well as we found multiple comments of them laughing and outing themselves). Later on, we extracted data from their phones which had been willing given to the police and they had researched my and my husbands net worth, blueprints to our home, how much our cars were worth, how to claim rape against a teacher, how to be an influencer, how to get away with a crime, how to be rich, and how to be famous on IG. My lawyers discovered over 20,000 porn/violence/gang/drug/money content on their phones, including multiple nude images of fellow female classmates to which they used as blackmail. One of the accusers went to juvie soon after my arrest for sexual assault of a female student. 

I had multiple teachers and students make statements into the record of what I have stated above and came to my support. You would think this was a pretty open-and-shut case. Well, the law isn’t written like that. In this state, any sexual contact between an adult and a minor is automatically the adults fault, aside from extreme duress (having a gun pointed to your head). My very knowledgeable and very expensive lawyers stated that this was a case of he-said, she-said as there was no concrete evidence of the rape or that it ever occurred. The rest could be proven that it wasn’t me because of my school reports and witness testimonies. I was looking at 30 years in prison and was told that I couldn’t prove that I was raped at the point of duress. 

The DA offered me six plea deals over the years to which I declined all. I was determined to go to trial and fight for myself. My lawyers kept coming back unsure of what the jury would come back with because of the demographics for this area + “horse-trading” that is typically done. If I was found guilty on even 1 charge of the 30, I would be going to prison and become a lifetime registered offender. I got scared. I got angry. After being released on bail, I spent most of my time in a psych hospital unable to discuss my case and trying to come to terms with my rape, in a world where these 8 boys said I raped them. 

I was tired and I ran out of energy. I ran out of money. This is now year 4 of fighting. The DA asked what plea I would accept; there has been two new DAs on this case and they were also tired it seemed. I told them Tier 1 (they didn’t want to come off lifetime) and time served. They agreed. I only went to prison on paper, ankle monitor was taken off, I got Tier 1, and pled guilty to 2 counts of Statutory Rape and 6 charges of Annoying a Minor (which is the registration offense). 

The accusers immediately sued the school the day after my arrest. The school did not want to fight it and settled for $1 million each within a couple of weeks of being served. I could never find a lawyer to take my case to sue the school even though I had reported and reported, I had all the evidence I tried to get help, I have all of the teacher reports that I let them know I was being hurt in my classroom. I am an autistic female, I am unable to navigate most normal situations and this was BEYOND a normal situation. Every lawyer said that they could not help me because of the pending criminal side. 

I am still angry. So so angry. I was exposed to the severe abuse done to others by police in jails. I saw mental health inmates left in their excrements for weeks, an inmate with severe burns from boiling water go unattended and ignored for almost two weeks before someone showed up. I researched the ADA requirements that should be given to those with severe disabilities and these didn’t even exist. 

I want to spend every single minute of my freedom to rally and fight and change anything/everything that I can about the system so this injustice doesn’t happen to someone else. 

Edit to add: You may ask, as everyone else has, why didn’t I just quit. It was my first job. I wanted to be a teacher, I wanted to make a difference and help. I cared. I knew (after being hired) that the students at this school came from a troubled, violent, and poor background. That’s what I came from (my mother and I were sold into human trafficking when I was six. She died. I escaped when I was 16 and joined the military so I could pay my way for college). There’s a lot of mental health issues at the forefront of this and sometimes, there isn’t a great explanation that makes sense. I have severe C-PTSD and it’s easy to fall back into the flight-or-fight response; mine being Fawning to please my abuser so they maybe hurt me less. 

Edit 2: It seems people deem me as a liar because I put the word “severely” before Autism. I have removed it. For education, Autism is a spectrum and it manifests differently in females and males and varies greatly between persons. I have 138 IQ, excellent in academics, and superior in math/pattern recognition etc. Outside of these strengths, I have none. I have trouble with speech, catatonia, AARFID, sensory aversion, I cannot take care of myself in the home, struggle to drive, struggle to leave my house. This was my very first job and I was led to believe it was originally a college-prep charter. This was absolutely not the case and things went downhill quickly. I have answered doubts below regarding some good questions such as “where was your husband” “autistic people cannot join the military” “you have no assets but paid almost $1million”. I do not have assets, my husband and HIS assets are not in the US. 

I will no longer be replying to comments. I hope my story helps someone and I will continue to take suggestions on avenues to change laws that inhumanely punish those convicted of sexually-related crimes. We need to create a movement of altruism and understanding regarding the RSO community.

1hgg84t,post,Help/Questions Canada,"Hey all, New account to post here.  I live in British Columbia.  I had my early morning knock a few months ago, all my electronics taken.  I have received some items back I’ve been told the rest will stay with the police, likely until charges.  

I will be charged with accessing and possession CSEM (not insubstantial amount of primarily videos) no communications, sharing etc.  
I gladly found and started therapy right after the knock(wish I had gone sooner knowing what I know now, but doesn’t everyone.) I’ve had quite a few sessions already and feel like the CBT is slowing having an effect.(harder than I thought it would be) that said I know every case is different, I suspect I will end up in jail for a term, with probationary period.

Really not sure how much information I should share.  Without charges, I feel like a rat waiting in a cage for something bad that’s coming. Limbo. Depression before was already an issue, this has triggered more of the self harm thoughts.(the therapy is helping)

I have a few questions.

I’m in my 50s, no priors.

I’m socking away what money I can, paid off my outstanding debts, given lawyer a good amount so far. I’m slowly removing items from my apartment I cannot pack up alone to move/put into storage when I will need to.(maybe going overboard).

I have not told anyone about this yet, not sure how /when I will.

I currently work in construction management.  What are the odds that after this is all over I will be able to get/keep this job in construction.  Is this even in the realm of reality.  
Will people know the minute I’m charged?  Should I be preparing for something new?  

Does everyone end up on the Canadian registry? Even though it’s now up to the judge.

Is almost everyone (99%)getting jail now? Even though the mandatory has been shut down? 

Is this considered the same as a contact crime as far as the law goes? Violence against children?

What makes a case go to indictment vs summary? Is it just prosecution choice? For possession odds of indictment?

Is there any chance of a normal life after conviction?  What should I expect for work/housing. I’m assuming to loose all/most my friends, work colleagues.

Do people leave their current living situation and move cities? Is that something I should plan for?  Can I be evicted? 

I don’t see that many people in the news for these charges, are there way more cases not being reported on? I look at Canlii.org and don’t see that many newer cases (I know not all make it there). Wondering what the odds of my case making it to the news.

Should I be doing more than just therapy? Primarily to help me but also for when I stand for the judge.

Any help advice from people in Canada, particularly British Columbia.

1hfsno5,post,Update indicted w/o being notified,"Second update: After speaking to my husband's lawyer, he stated after the rebooking, they indicted him the next day. That was september! So we went 3 months without knowing he was indicted. I think that is so crazy. Maybe it was good for our mental health not knowing.. Also, the remainder of the discovery was sent to our attorney last week. Idk the timing and delays and throwing all these numbers around without being fully informed is nuts to me. What I've taken from everyone's responses is you and your lawyer may not know you'll be indicted or when, and it doesn't make a huge difference if you are. Evidently, this case has gone on for too long that a plea deal for indictment waiver wasn't an option in my husband's case bc they've done all the heavy investigative lifting and filing for indictment wasn't too big a deal for them to pursue. Where if your case is processing quickly, accepting a plea for indictment waiver may benefit you.

Edit: State case based in NJ

There has been an update in my husband's case and I want to know if anyone else has ever gone through this. 

Quick background, he was arrested for possession in Dec 2022, had pretrial conference arraignment hearing? Idk what it is this court session is called exactly, it occurred in April 2023. The State was told to provide discovery within 90 days, they didnt, and case was dismissed without prejudice in July of 2023. They brought the case back up (reissued? Idk terminology) in Sept 2024. He was rearrested put back on probation.  He just had his second pretrial arraignment conference. Prior to today, the last time we spoke to attorney was in September, we were told the prosecutor was looking to indict but no one knew when and he had mentioned 5 years, parole after 18. 

We just left his pretrial arraignment today where, get this, the attorney says they're looking to go for 6 years, parole eligible after 5. Higher than the numbers discussed in september, and if we want to go all the way back the first prosecutor initally said somewhere between 364 to 3 years parole after 9 months. Again, no formal offer and that prosecutor left. Here's the big kicker, after today's court session his attorney mentions he has already been indicted!! This is news to us. Shouldn't an attorney tell their client if they're indicted or coming up for indictment??

Also, I am so confused why the plea keeps going up? Why did we find out the day he goes into court the previous mentioned numbers went up.. we have never been given a formal plea? 

How did your attorney tell you about your first plea? Was it sit down inside his office or in passing on the phone just throwing out numbers? Isnt there paperwork and details? 
Aren't they supposed to tell their clients if they were indicted?

But if you have done any prison time at all, you can never receive a pardon. Yet if you commit a federal prison S.O. crime, the president him or herself can pardon you if he or she wishes. Doesn't really make sense since majority of sex offenses are felonies and majority of felonies require prison time.

1hf9agx,post,Church,"My husband and I are butting heads on this so we will ask the masses. 

Can a registered sex offender physically attend church service at a church (on Sunday) that has an extensive child area? For instance basketball courts outside and two indoor playgrounds? There are over 500 children in the youth area each Sunday with it separated by school grade with kids in child care areas as young as 6 months old. I also want to note that the area is used as a daycare during the week (Monday through Friday) it’s rented out from the church.

Already have done 2, so 8 more to go. I was living in transitional housing, then with my parents. Now neither are available. My BF of 8 years, and I want to live together. I'm 32 male, not on probation or parole. Did two years in prison. I am currently working as is my bf. We Could definitely afford a apartment, but I dont think with my background,  and me having to register that any place will accept me. So wondering if I just lived there, not on the lease, and kept a low profile, if that would be okay? Of course I'd register the address to SO officer I report too. But wondering if other ppl have done this as well and it's all good. Or did this and ended badly? If anyone knows another route, I'd gladly listen. But BFs lease is up end of this month so kindve in a crunch for time. We both have bad credit, and neither has anything saved up.

1hf2s6f,post,Looking for my own income/business.   What business can i start that works well for SOs?,"I need to find a way to no longer rely on employers.  I cannot tell you the amount of times I've been discriminated against due to being a RSO or an employer who seriously took advantage of me.

I really want to attempt at finding a way to earn my own income without the hassle of dealing with an employer.  However, i am not sure how to go about starting or running a business or what kind of business i can open up.  I cannot say i have any particular skills other than some IT skills.  I do have a CDL and i would only have around $10,000 in savings that i would have to gamble with.  

Does anyone know what i can do here?  I wish to take advantage of any kinds of programs that could be available for felons that can train or show us how to open a business and how to run it.  I wouldnt know which kind of business to open other than probably buying a small truck to make deliveries in some way or handing out business cards for IT, but in all honesty, im not sure how to go about doing things in a realistic manner and in a way that will generate my own income to actually support myself.  I used to make $40/hr but now i only make $24/hr.  My income is not that great compared to what i used to make and i was only super lucky to obtain that $40/hr job.  

I was wondering if anyone had any guidance, information or something that i can try to take this journey seriously.  I want to take opening up my own business seriously but i have no idea how to go about this properly.  Anyone out there with experience with this who was a RSO?  What business were you able to start and how did it go?  What type of business do you think works for RSO that might be in demand and thats obtainable?  Any help or guidance would be appreciated.

Is it feasible, if your name's been in the local paper for a conviction for an online crime against childeren, to continue to be a young child's dad? 

Can u safely take him to the park? Pick up and drop off from school? Have his friends over for playdates? Will the school let u attend parents evening etc? Will he get bullied?

Or is it, for practical reasons, the end of you parenting him? Even if the court only restricts your online behaviour?

Or can parenting continue, but differently?

1heyssz,post,Need help with opening a halfway house in my state (AZ).,"I am 25 years old and was recently released from prison on a sex offence felony on a minor, through the internet. Scroll directly to the bottom paragraph if you don't care about the context of the question, and just want the dang question. I tend to not stop talking once I start, apparently online too.

My story doesn't really matter besides for the basic facts, and I have a tendency to ramble so here goes.
I live in Arizona, which can be a really rough state depending on where you lie, county jurisdiction wise.

In this state we have about 2 or maybe 3 designed sex-offender halfway houses. GP can stay here too but they (obviously) don't like to unless they've been kicked out of everywhere else and don't last long here generally. Off topic, anyways, the conditions in this house are abysmal. I went into it knowing it was going to be bad, recently released men with probably drug or alcohol problems, coexisting mental health conditions, no real support etc. I am a mentally, physically etc healthy male in the supposed to be genetically peak of my life right now, everything is supposed to be leveling out, and the conditions at this house/program as a whole are so stressful in daily life that I got injured at work, had to bed rest for 3 days ended up getting fired cause it's a shitty construction temp job for ex inmates who just got out and you are the definition of replaceable. 

The shit built up so fast, I'm not gonna get into my whole life story, but thank God, I realized I had been in a state of near constant mania for 2 entire weeks after getting fired and was scaring the shit out of my roommates and family, and I'm emotionally in tune enough to realize what I was doing while I was doing it, I knew what was going on, I've had episodes before, but this one was really bad because I just couldn't stop no matter how hard I tried.

Thank God, literally, they just opened up a mental health walk in center 2 minutes walk from my house with a genuinely beautiful soul of a psychiatrist, I told her my struggles fully transparent and honest about my background and the last 5 years of my life, and totally did not judge, just wanted to help. She got me on the meds I needed to not completely zombie me out like some medications do, but just enough to curve the mania i experience from psychosis level to an actually functional and controllable level, since I started taking these meds I feel like superman lol. I can chill out or get excited whenever I want. Sad that I'm excited to just exist like everyone else does normally. Anyways.

Long story fucking long, I see men here who genuinely want to improve their lives and get better, but like me, they get snared by life and bad conditions, and they can never cultivate that golden seed that lives inside all of us man. They're surrounded by bad soil and roots that choke them and they don't get any light, no help at all from anyone. They get released just like I did, put on a couch and told ""figure it out"". They say they have resources, but when you actually ask them ""hey when's the church service?"" Or ""hey do you guys do mental health diagnoses as well"" and I found out they're actually under fire right now from the government for being shady as hell in the ""nonprofit, helping people get their lives together"" part of everything. I think they're peeling back the curtain and seeing how ugly this all is here. The damn bedbugs and roaches are the real residents here, we just pay money to lay on disgusting spring twin bed that's been through Vietnam, and get bitten by bedbugs all night. Wake up in the morning to make coffee and the roaches all scatter out ofd the sink, full of disgusting dishes that weren't even rinsed out, just tossed in for the roaches to finish off, when you just fucking washed them the night before. Shit is TRULY a horrid, disgusting existence here. 

I got the help I truly needed in prison and now know how to be an effective leader who can communicate himself and be trusted with responsibility and power. I think my age makes people doubt that, but I've been through way more than most and my actions and character can attest to that. 

I not only see this as an opportunity to help men who WANT to change, I'm not going to waste my time on the busters and the lames, I will discharge them and send them straight back to the roaches and bedbugs they came from.

But I want to start a REAL nonprofit organization with a Christian focus on helping recently released sex offenders transition back into society, SAFELY and in full cooperation with any legal or probation/parole guidelines. I want to help the men who want to help themselves, just like I did. We all really do just need a helping hand sometimes.

I guess that's what I'm asking for now. I'm not stupid, I know I don't need to run out, buy a house, fill it with guys and try to figure it all out as I go. I'm borderline Asperger's or something, I believe, me and my psych are trying to figure out that diagnoses right now, but that's another story.

I know I need structure and if I really want to see this through I need to take it as slow and careful as possible, one wrong move or wrong choice, mistake, etc can completely cripple this, and I don't even know if it's a realistic expectation as I know insurance for sex offenders in organizations like halfway houses is a hellish nightmare. 

All I know, truly, is that God made me a new creation in prison, I'm not perfect now by anyones damn means and I don't want to be. I'm at the age and point in my life where I am going to take control, I'm sick and tired of others, ESPECIALLY those way worse off than me in other areas of life, but because they paid their rent a month in advance, they think they got the blueprints and wanna tell me how to live. 

I'm my own man, my experiences and life have brought me to a place of natural leadership in social structures(even when I don't fucking WANT TO BE 😭 i.e the group ""dad"" or the ""therapist homie"", etc). Everything in my life is aligning perfectly, even the manic episode was necessary to open my eyes to certain things I wouldn't have seen fully before. 

This isn't just a money thing to me like it is to the current administration of this program. That's cool to finance my life, but really I don't even know what I would do if I made $1000 a week. I've budgeted and saved and penny pinched my whole life, money is just a tool to me lol. I don't worship it or what I can bring me. 

But, I used to tear people down when I was haunted by bad energy, demons, addiction, whatever. Destroyed houses, families, home, even did the dumbest thing I could ever do and betrayed my baby mama and kids trust and love in me as a result on my decisions. I got the help I needed and you can call it whatever you would like to, but it's almost as if my brain was acting like an energy magnet, and God just flipped the polarity from negativity to positivity.

I bring the men directly around me up, they tell me this even when I don't directly observe it, tell me that I'm making an impact in their lives, I'm gonna go somewhere, I'm on the right track, etc. I hear it constantly but remain the same. in the 4 months I've lived at this property I'm the only one here who consistently maintains and repairs it, I act almost as a fucking therapist to those around me when they need it, and I'm just their buddy talking shit about video games and childhood and smoking a joint on the back porch when they're not. I literally feel the embodiment of love and joy within me daily and all I truly seek to do is help others reach the place I live in most of the time now. Everything else, truly, doesn't matter to me. I don't care about the hot girlfriends or a fancy car or a big empty house that's beautiful but ugly in the inside, etc. I don't. My eyes got opened up over the past few years of loss and suffering and pain, and now I want to build my life around me, doing the thing I truly love to do most in this world, help another person along their path. 

TLDR: I live in a shitty halfway house, my experiences in life I feel have qualified me to lead with confidence, and I want to use that ability to help SO's recently released get actual help instead of being sucked into this shit hole cycle where they only care about you because you pay them $900 a month. I have a natural gift of listening and communicating, empathizing and helping others with actionable and real advice. I want to use these gifts/talents to do the same thing thing halfway house program claims to do, but fails to deliver on, because they only care about the money. 

 
I want to take what I'm currently doing in my life, and scale the size to help more people. If you read all of this, please help 😭",3,5.0,2024-12-15 18:25:36,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1heyssz/need_help_with_opening_a_halfway_house_in_my/

CONGRESSWOMAN NANCY MACE INTRODUCES THE ""SAFE SHELTERS ACT OF 2024"" TO PROTECT WOMEN AND CHILDREN IN EMERGENCY SHELTERS

December 12, 2024 

Press Release

(WASHINGTON, D.C., December 12th, 2024) - Rep. Nancy Mace, a survivor and advocate for women, is pushing the Safe Shelters Act to bar registered sex offenders from emergency shelters shared with women and children during disasters.



This bill has been cosponsored by Reps. Anna Paulina Luna, Van Drew, Weber and Boebert.



The bill builds upon policies in Florida counties like Flagler and Marion which require sex offenders to evacuate to separate facilities or dedicated shelters. Mace's bill:



Prohibits sex offenders from entering undesignated emergency shelters

Requires immediate notification to shelter operators of sex offender registration status

Allows FEMA to designate specific shelters for registered sex offenders

Establishes federal penalties for non-compliance, including potential fines and imprisonment

""In times of crisis, shelters must be sanctuaries, not hunting grounds for predators,"" said Rep. Nancy Mace. ""Women and girls are 3.5 times more likely to experience sexual violence in chaotic, post-disaster environments. Women and children deserve safety, protection, and peace of mind. Our bill will make sure disaster shelters remain a place of refuge for those in their most vulnerable state.“



""Women and children should never face the risk of being exposed to sex offenders in emergency shelters. While providing shelter during emergencies is essential, these places should be free from other dangers,"" said Rep. Luna. ""FEMA must establish emergency shelters that restrict access to sexual predators. I am proud to co-sponsor this critical legislation protecting vulnerable disaster victims from any potential further harm. Our emergency shelters should be safe, secure, and free from harm for all who seek refuge.""

We are still waiting for probation to reach out and set a day for him to do it but anyone that has been through this...what can he expect? Does he need to bring anything with him for the interview? What kind of questions are they asking? Are you allowed to review the report before it is given to the judge? Does it actually make any difference? He is also doing a pychosexual evaluation and is already in therapy once a week. Soo many questions I can barely think with everything going on..

Also second question, for anyone in NY do you know what the safeguard program is? Our lawyer keeps mentioning that he might have to complete this before he's even allowed to see our daughter and that it could take up to a year...he said with everything we are doing, including the evaluation that it might convince the judge to allow him to at least see his daughter while going through it but I can't find any information on it anywhere. 

As always thank you all so much, this group has been a rock for me to hold onto while lost in this chaos. Thank you..🙏🏼",4,7.0,2024-12-13 16:27:21,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1hdfzqm/pre_sentence_investigation_report_ny_probation/
1hdermy,post,Curious if there's help out there. ,"Hello, my husband and I live in Virginia. I met him not long after he was out on probation. Female accused of him doing  stuff 6 or 7 years ago. She claimed she was 13 but she was older anyway. That made the arrest even worse. Long story short he took plea but before he told cops she was not 13, he didn't even know her at 13. Cops said we'll if you argue this they will come back again and change the dates and arrest you again. (Sounds ridiculous to me)
So he served 2yr jail 2yr prison. He is listed as a sex offender aggervated sexual battery since she claimed she was 13. 
12 years since he got out, we have been together dating and marriage. He did excellent on his probations supervised and unsupervised also. Always filling out registries on time. He has a career and we are buying  our home now so far 7 years.
So, because of his record and registry we been blocked by jobs, schools ( to see his daughter graduate), college threw him out because a underage girl was taking classes not even in the same class as he and now our only fun we had was going on Carnival cruises. We went on 6 and headed to our 7th when they cancelled his trip and refused him to go on any cruise. It would be different if he had never sailed before. 
Is there any hope in finding a way to i guess pardon or remove him from the registry? He is an excellent husband and grandfather of 4 kids we love so much. He is now 46 and we just want to travel and share things with our grandkids. Thanks for reading our story.

1hdbujg,post,Reality vs high hopes,"Please help me understand the differences between what’s possible with a positive attitude and “reality”.. 

My husband is federal for CSAM. Been in 2yrs has till April 2027.

He previously worked 4years for USPS. Was pretty valuable as he was scheme trained, meaning he had every route memorized in a decent sized suburb of Detroit.
When he was arrested they did it at work with the escort of the USPS officers. So USPS is obviously very aware. 
My husband has it in his head that not only that location, but ANY location(we are now in Minnesota) will gladly hire him. But those I’ve talked to who have worked with SO’s have said there’s no way any postmaster will even look at his app. 
He is also convinced I am exaggerating my struggle to find a place to live that will accept him where I live. There are local residency restrictions and there are schools parks and daycares literally on EVERY block. 
I’ve been told however that my area is decent for finding factory type work for SO’s. 

Anyways, he is adamant that I’m exaggerating how many road blocks we will have to break thru. That a positive attitude is all he needs. 
He is also convinced that he is going to be granted permission to go to our local BMX track to watch our kids race. He was given permission during pretrial phase, which I understand to be unheard of. And I also understand there is even a chance he will not be able to live here at home with our underage children. 
He also is telling me that Safety Plans only have to be made with PO’s while he is on home confinement. 

Please help me understand reality…. ",4,9.0,2024-12-13 13:09:54,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1hdbujg/reality_vs_high_hopes/
1hd9ewz,post,UK employment,"Hi all. I’m awaiting sentencing for possession of cat a and b images. I’m likely looking at a suspended sentence but you never know. My employers have randomly just tried to DBS check me and therefore I’ve left my job with immediate effect because my guilty plea at Magistrates will be detailed on there (confirmed by a DBS solicitor).

My question is: what did UK-based people in the group go on to do for employment post-sentencing? I have the option of working for myself but I’ll make nowhere near as much money as I have been these past few years. I want to explore my options but every job I look at seems to want a background check or DBS. I’m frustrated too that loads of supposedly “conviction-friendly” employers have clauses whereby they exclude people convicted of sex offences.

I’m looking for inspiration ideally. TIA.

1hd1cd4,post,How should i disclose my record to employers? I hold a misdemeanor and do not have to register anymore. I am also applying to legal assistant jobs. Unsure of how to tackle this.,"I currently hold a charge titled ""Luring Children or Mentally Ill Persons With Use of Technology, Gross Misdemeanor"". I was involved in a sting operation. I do not have to register anymore and am able to seal my record in about 2 years. Ive been unemployed through my entire probation and now i am trying to get back into working. I am currently halfway through a paralegal studies degree at my college and have decided to start applying to entry level positions. Im not just seeking tips on how to disclose to attorneys or law firms, but to general jobs as well since i will be applying to those too.

That being said, I have an interview for a position at a firm and I have a friend who told me their firm was looking to add on another assistant. The thing is, i have no idea how to explain my charge. The language of the charge sounds as heinous as can be and im worried that even if im not registered and only have a gross misdemeanor, i wont be able to pass background checks. Especially since the wording of my charge sounds bad.

If i try to 'downplay' it, it sounds terrible and as if i'm avoiding accountability or lying. If i disclose too much information about what happened, it sounds bad too. Im just really stuck on how to go about this.  I figured i ask some seasoned people here on how i should explain the charge if/when it comes up in job interviews or with HR. I am hopeful though since someone I knew in SO therapy was working at a small law firm. I asked him about how he got his position as a SO and felon and he said, ""youd be surprised, they dont really give a shit"", but then again it was a small firm.

If there are any people here in the legal world at all and could give some anecdotes on how getting into the industry despite the charge/registry, im happy to hear about it too.",9,8.0,2024-12-13 01:46:44,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1hd1cd4/how_should_i_disclose_my_record_to_employers_i/

1hd091j,post,SOTP in Oklahoma? It feels impossible...,"We live in very rural Oklahoma. Husband took an Alford Plea in a state case for 5 counts of possession of csam (no-contact) after fighting it for 3 years and is now awaiting sentencing (very complicated case). 

He took a PSI report and the PO neither suggested a length of incarceration or probation (they put, ""Detention should be determined by the court""). He voluntarily to ok a PsychoSexual Eval early last year and it determined he was incredibly low risk and showed no attraction to anyone under 25-35 age range. He also took 2 polygraph tests and passed every one. 

However, all of this came out of our pocket and was performed by individuals out of the state and cost us a hefty amount (while voluntary, it was required by DHS for him to have contact with our children). 

The problem is that the DOC is requiring him to complete a SOTP and the state has absolutely no one that performs these types of programs anymore. If he is incarcerated, they no longer offer it in the state prisons and most who are charged with these crimes are required by Oklahoma law to complete them before being eligible for parole. If he is on probation, the closest provider that can take him is in Houston, TX (9hours away). The PO is aware of this and told him that he would have to figure it out. When he asked if Zoom was an option the PO said no. Plus, the state requires that the offender pay for treatment costs out of their own expenses. My husband would have to travel to Houston once every 2 weeks for in person and would have to pay $900 per session. Failure to do so would be a violation of his probation. However, his attorneys already know that he will not be allowed to leave the state during probation! 

We are beyond frustrated. He is factually innocent of these charges and has done everything possible to show he is not a threat to children and that he does not have a sexual or pornography addiction. But the DA won't budge.

I was wondering if people can share experiences on being new parents AFTER you been through the system.

We will be having the baby in Las Vegas, NV, and I know their rules are pretty laid back. I was born and raised there.

How do you guys navigate having young childern who may not be able to get to enjoy the same things as other kids like sleep overs seeing as how it's probably a big conflict of interest.

Do you allow your child's friend to come over and play?

What about explaining to the kid when the time is right about your past so they understand, when did you tell your story? Obiviously you have to be careful as sometimes young kids are loose with their lips.

Any advice helps.",0,6.0,2024-12-12 22:30:02,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1hcxaqh/on_being_a_new_parent_questions_i_have/

1hcsa58,post,Change . Org Petitions and why they’re not allowed here  ,"

Please note that I am not trying to call out the person who posted it,  I’m positive it was an  innocent mistake and they had good intentions. 

But I want you to know why we don’t allow them (Rule #14), what to look for, what you should consider, and why you should think twice about signing them. 

*note that many of these things do not apply to that particular petition as it appears it was created by a reputable organization(though I don’t know if there’s a way to verify that, I haven’t looked) , they are just things to look for. 

1. You are doxxing yourself. Every person who posted “I signed it!” Was incredibly easy to determine who you are due to the correlation with the time it was signed right next to your name. 
People who signed it and didn’t post that they did still showed up, just no direct correlation to who you are, but it’s obvious you’re in the group because no one had signed it in months. 

2. Look at the dates on them. The one posted today was a year old. It had 7000 signatures. These petitions don’t go anywhere unless the organizer compiles them and sends them to legislators. If they did that, which I doubt most people do, then imagine they did it a year ago when they created it. 

3. Do you know the organizer? Do you know what they plan to do with your personal information? They’re the ones who recieve it. Are they legitimate? 

The petition itself isn’t doing anything unless the organizer utilizes it. Consider the likelihood that they will and if it’s worth doxxing yourself by giving out personal information. 

Regardless, please don’t post them here, it’s a safety issue. I don’t think most of you want people knowing who you are.

1hcc08b,post,Trying to help my brother ,"I don't know a whole lot about RSO restrictions and want to learn more. My brother will hopefully be getting out in the next few years and I want to help him out as much as possible. 

When my brother gets out I will likely be the only one in my family able to help him out. If he ends up living with me will he be able to be around my children since he is related or how does that all work? Would I need to be present at all times around my own kids if he is around? Note: I am not worried about something happening, just want to know the common rule around minor family members.

I'm hoping to get him a trailer near my place ( I have 200 acres outside of town). Would he be able to live out of town? ( Probably up to his PO). 

I'm learning certain jobs are out of the question but think I could get him a job with the company I work for just in a different role such as new construction plumber, electrician or HVAC installer. He really has no work experience in the outside world as he was young when he went away but my company, like many others do a lot of trade jobs can be all/ mostly on the job training

Sorry I am not great at writing exactly what I am thinking but all the advice and criticism is appreciated.

This makes working in the IT very difficult as you can imagine and honestly most job markets.

I have roughly ten years of professional IT experience in help desk, managing a help desk team, cloud environment building and deployment and systems administration. My thought is to perhaps open my own consulting agency, that way I can use my own computer and make sure they are monitored by the NCPTC software so that I'm not in violation of my release terms.

My question to those of you that have continued to work in IT post conviction, what types of businesses did you create and what services did you offer?

This week I accepted a plea deal after being on supervised release for a year and my charge was downgraded to Commercial Sexual Exploitation which is a petty misdemeanor with a maximum of 30 days in jail. My sentence is 6 months probation with no jail time, no registration, and I have to continue therapy until my probation is over. My probation is pretty relaxed and has no electronic monitoring involved. I’m so grateful for this community and for this second chance. There were times when I thought my entire life was over. If anyone has any questions, I am happy to answer them.",48,19.0,2024-12-09 10:03:50,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1ha6hoh/took_a_plea_deal_reducing_my_felony_down_to_a/

1h9srag,post,Need info ,"Hi I need some information I live in Wisconsin and my son was accused of having child porn on his phone. It turns out he had no knowledge of it because it was in a app he no longer used and the pictures were sent from a hacked account and were sent to everyone in their contacts. My son was on probation for a drug charge and probation found that on his phone they analyze the phone and everything was proven that the probation officer opened up that app. He got revoked on his drug charge and the other charge of child porn, he was acquitted of all charges. So he's currently in prison on the drug charge and when he is released probation is telling him he has to register as a sex offender. Even though he was acquitted of all charges. Does anybody know can they do this he's never had any other charges besides the one felony drug charge.

1h9qcqm,post,Pretrial vs Probation vs Supervised,"Currently on pretrial for recipient of CSAM (chatting online with “24 yr old”; then said really I am 14, then sent a nude pic. I said no thanks, then blocked — fast forward a year or so; got raided, seized computers/tablet/phone, grilled for like 3 hours and released - next day got a lawyer. And had to leave the house as I have a child (daughter). Fast forward 3.5 years to Sept (3 months ago) — got indicted then arrested) — case is Federal.

Within the first couple of days on pretrial .. lost job (they notified my employer), no support at all from wife and won’t let me see my daughter. Wife has to “approve” with pretrial but won’t. Have to beg her multiple times for just a picture.

Pretrial is house detention (front/back porch only), no computer, no Internet, no alcohol and GPS monitoring (ankle monitor). Can’t go to park, library or anyplace there are kids. Have to “schedule” 48 hours in advance to a limited number of places; lawyer, church, doctor, employment site and court mandated therapy.

Been rough trying to get a job. Have to have someone “help” me use the Internet. Which is frustrating and tedious (this post).

Been trying to get monitored Internet for work only, but have to secure a job first. And lawyer said it is $200 to $300 per month that I will have to pay.

It snowed and I could not even put ice melt down, next day having to go to “court therapy” almost wiped out in the frozen snow/ice.

Hi all,

I am considering dating someone on the registry with whom I've been close friends for a while. I want it to work out so badly. 

* How does dating work in WI? Does anyone have experience with this? Will I have to talk to his PO or will she want to meet me? What are the stipulations?
* He was told that in the next year and a half, he'd be off probation and could have his charges dropped completely. Does anyone have experience with this too?
* What about staying the night at places? Is it a universal ""no"" or does it vary via PO? I'm sorry if anything seems ignorant, I want to make sure he's following the rules and that I'm not adding to anything. 

If you want to explain anything to me, please feel free. I'm extremely willing to listen.

I still get this voice in the back of my head like I'm scared that he's not being fully honest about consenting, that he might be uncomfortable without me realizing, even though I try to communicate with him about both of our desires clearly and respectfully, and check in with him often both inside and outside of a sexual context. 

SO's, how do you allow yourself to engage in safe sex again post-offense, without being held up by guilt or fear? Or do you abstain altogether?

1h8on8y,post,Hello I'm new now,"Hi I'm 20 years old, female. I was in jail for 3 months due to possession and distribution of CP. The judge ordered conditional sentence so I'm on house arrest until May. (first time offender)

I was a troll online, just doing and saying dumb stuff to get a negative reaction out of people. I never meant any of the things I said or did, I just did it for fun and my own satisfaction. I wanted to be like a notorious online troll that people would talk on social media like Meowbahh or Bella the Wolf. During my trolling days, I took it too far with sending gore, death threats, just disgusting content. Then I saw a YouTube video about a guy visiting different levels of the dark web and that made me curious to try what he did too.
I downloaded Tor, pasted an onion link and there was a specific ad on the side of the screen that caught my attention. I clicked on it not knowing it was a CP website. I was really shocked because I never thought that would actually exist! I had an idea that this could be the worst trolling idea yet and wanted to traumatize random people. So I viewed multiple videos and downloaded them, and sent it to random people on a Discord server just to see their reaction. It was like shock content but far worse. Now I'm on house arrest and I feel like I ruined my whole life now. I think about suicide a lot almost everyday. I feel like such a burden on my family for this. I always thought I could help myself but I realize I can't. I want help but I'm too afraid to ask.

I don't do these things anymore. Being in jail basically changed me.
I don't even know what to do with my life anymore. I'm still waiting in line for my local therapy since May.

1h88xeu,post,A word of encouragement from an outsider,"  
Foreword: I hope this post doesn't come off as trivializing or condescending; please, let me know if it does. 

To be clear, I'm not a registered sex offender; I don't know what it's like, personally. However, I did have a recent encounter with the law that gave me a new, albeit primitive, understanding of it.  
  
I was convicted of a DUI because I blew a stop sign while a cop was tailing me, and the ambien I had taken 7 hours before hadn't quite worn off, and I didn't notice. The prosecutor wouldn't drop it to reckless driving because, and I quote, ""he looked high."" Now, because of the state that I live in, this is on my public record for the rest of my life. While I did my community service, a manager of a recycling plant explained to me how easy it is to become a registered sex offender, i.e. pee on a tree and a kid walks up out of no where or something along those lines.

And after all that, I've become really irritated with how people treat RSO's. All it takes is a handful of powerful people, maybe even just one, to decide on a whim, whether you belong on a permanent, public display and to be figuratively tarred and feathered. People you meet don't know how that court case happened. They don't know the context. They don't know YOU. All they see is a scary sign with your picture on it, and yet the norm in society is to treat RSO's like villains without a second thought.

I can't imagine how difficult it would be to live as an RSO. Humans are social creatures. We care what other people think. This is not to mention all the practical hurdles of finding work and housing.  
  
With all that said though, try as hard as you can in dark moments to remember your value, who you really are, today, right now, behind what everyone else sees, aside from whatever happened in the past. You are just a person, like everyone else, no matter how often you're told otherwise. There are people who see through the dossier when they look at you and empathize. Search for those people, because they will be your best friends, and I wish you the best of luck finding them.",61,4.0,2024-12-06 19:02:56,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1h88xeu/a_word_of_encouragement_from_an_outsider/

1h7f0wd,post,A couple job tips,"I’ve been unemployed for the past month or so and I just wanted to share some information I’ve learned along the way.  Feel free to add more because I’m sure there is a lot I don’t know.

1. If you get fired from your job be sure to file an unemployment claim with the state even if you think you’re not eligible.  I didn’t think I was but I was pleasantly surprised.  The worst that happens is you get denied and lose an hour of your time. 

2. Check your state’s offender reentry program and schedule a meeting.  I met with a woman yesterday who treated me with kindness and seems very invested in helping me find a job.  There is a federal bond program that will protect employers from any harm you might cause and also tax breaks for companies that hire felons.  So there are some incentives out there for companies to hire felons/ex-cons.  Note - these programs are not specific to RSOs and the woman I spoke to admitted that it is still difficult for us to find employment despite these programs.

3. I was able to find a couple remote “jobs” as an independent contractor.  These are hit and miss and definitely don’t give you steady work but there is no background check. If you have at least a college degree take a look at AI companies.  There are 5-6 of them that hire AI “trainers” and the pay is pretty decent.  If you have an advanced degree or STEM experience you will be in demand.  These companies can be frustrating to deal with but it’s better than nothing.  

4. As many of you know there are filters on Indeed.com where you can search for jobs that theoretically hire persons with criminal backgrounds.  Be careful with these.  Many of these jobs just have standard boilerplate language that is required by CA and NY stating that they will consider people with criminal backgrounds.  So they aren’t really “fair chance” jobs.  Probably not worth your time unless you actually live in CA or NY.",23,10.0,2024-12-05 17:47:03,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1h7f0wd/a_couple_job_tips/

My family is supporting me by trying to keep my hopes up but I'm honestly at my wits end, to the point a rope looks like the best thing for me. I can't even fucking support myself anymore, each day is getting worse and worse applying and getting denied, I'm going crazy in this fucking house. People won't even let me speak on my side of story to explain what happened leading up to the charge. They see the offender status and automatically assume I'm a horrible human being. My probation officer seems nice, he says he sees no problem with me in the future and I'm ""one of the good cases"". Yet every week tells me I need to get a job, even though no where will hire me. I don't even know what I want out of responses on here because I don't want to here ""just keep applying someone will hire you"" because everyone has been saying that.. and yet it hasn't happened yet. I want to work, I want to start making money again I just don't know what to fucking do and 4 monthe in and I've already had enough of this life.

1h6ko7n,post,Advice needed badly,"Hello all, 

I am the idiot from KY who moved from NY in 2020 and I wish I never did, my dad lied to me when he was alive and before I moved down here.

Many issues have a risen the past year and it's getting very scary. 



Issue 1

SB 249 was created and passed in July which will force ALL PFR's to change their usernames and display names to their real name, a complete violation of privacy if not on paper or incarcerated. According to Guy Hamilton Smiths post/reply he was trying to get it struck down but I haven't heard anything promising and we're about to go into 2025. This would also conflict with NY's eStop internet identifier thing which even though it's been 16 YEARS, I have to keep going to them if I have changes.



Issue 2

What is the point of PFR site's which say ""This information can not be used to target, harass, or stalk a individual"" or something to that line. I mistakenly left an old post on my main account on this Subreddit which was posted 4-5 years ago and forgot about it. Someone in a game dev / mod community found me on here and outed me but with a twist. He called me a child rapist, a molester, a pedophile, etc. The same person spread the false information all over twitter and his boyfriends re-quoted/retweeted it, went into my followers list, and following list, spread the info there too. But the catch is, they spread KY's page, which isn't even the truth, and I had to force myself to learn webdesign to make a entire page dedicated to my child-hood, teenage-hood, adult-hood, real charge, receipts, static-99, etc. What these trolls did DESTROYED 20 years of hard work and dedication, destroying my reputation, my brand name, my logo, etc. Also, any friends I have, these goons are attacking them too because of association. I also was booted from the only KY community server on Discord because of the trolls and I never did anything wrong in it or anything wrong in KY, and the owner and moderators gave me no floor to speak on my own behalf and they too think I rape babies / kids. I've lost everything pretty much besides a couple of good friends left and I'm super bitter. 

Issue 3

New bill being introduced next session calendar to change the distance from 1,000 to 3,000 feet in KY, regardless of original conviction and time passed. So I basically get bent over and rammed by the KY's retarded policies once again for doing nothing wrong in 16 years.

Issue 4

Jobs.... I am physically falling apart with possibly of losing a leg or even both as I have a progressive disease eating at my legs and it's getting worse, on top of that, the edema which makes it harder to walk. I also have ADHD, Autism and PTSD/CPTSD and if you think getting a decent job as a PFR is bad, add all that to it and you're f---ed. I was about to contact one guy on AITAH which said he hires ex-cons and PFR's for data entry work but by the time I went to contact them, their account was deleted. Probably trolls forced them off Reddit.

Issue 5

North Carolina... My childhood friend moved down there in late 2022 along with his sister, nephew and niece in law due to the cost of living. He has Asperger's but isn't a PFR or even a criminal. He misses me a ton and I wish I could be there but NC's laws are as dumb as KY's when it comes to PFRs. If I call, I'd have to give them internet identifiers every time there is a change or addition, just like NY. I'd also have the residency restrictions like KY and I believe new laws are being introduced to make life even more hell. My other friend, her son and other kids are moving to NC as well in 2 years and I won't be able to see them ever again due to NC's laws. I'm the sons step-dad in a sense as I've been in his life since he was born, 16 years of it and still keep contact daily (and yes his mom took classes).



My options are very limited. Can't move to Germany or Sweden or any nice country like it because it costs too much to even start, and at 45, and my health is getting progressively worse.

Can someone help me ? I need friends in real life badly where I am as I only have 1 locally and he doesn't even know I'm a PFR and if he found out, he's shoot me as I live in a shoot first, ask questions later state. My other friends are in NY but can't host me or help me find a place and I can't even get set up with services until I'm a resident again but there's no place to move to and the prices are too high.

I'm scared to make new friends or expand on my life and I'm wasting my talents badly. I can do 3D Modeling, Digital Illustration, C#, Data Entry (Excel pro here) etc but no one will hire me because I have cooties.



PLEASE HELP :(

Thank you,

1h6gy5k,post,Please read. Released in Sept.,"I don't really know how to start this, so I guess I just will. I made a decision to harm an underaged person in 2020, and after a lot of shit in between, I was released in 2024 after serving 2 years and 7 months in prison.

I am ""on supervision"", if you can even call it that. Anyways, I lurked on this thread and was one of those guys who posts every detail of his case and life, and tried to explain what happened and play it off, and some of you guys took me by the scruff of my neck, shook me up, and said ""Dude, what the hell?"" And a few of you actually changed my life to this day. On the off chance you're still around and reading this, my name was something like ""Salamander"" back then, and thank you. I truly mean that. Your actions/words 5 years ago still have an effect on me today, and you don't even realize it cause you were just being you. Awesome. 

Sorry, got off track. I had a life plan in prison, and through Grace I somehow landed in the best yard for our class of offenders in my state. The food and all that, yeah was the ""best"" comparatively speaking, but I mean the best as in, the best for me. This was the only yard that had an education and treatment program similar to the treatment out here, but it was provided with real therapists, in a peer group for free, and I took it serious, got sober off alcohol and decided that I was really going to get better once I got out.

So, to save both of us time because I really don't want to write a book about everything going wrong in my life, I'll hit the key points. I thought it would be roses and daisies after release, and I knew it wasn't then when I was incarcerated, and surprise! It's not roses and daisies now. No jobs were hiring when I got out, so I didn't finally get something until the end of October.

I get this job, and it's through my halfway house so it's one of those ""get what you get"" type of jobs, but my release program that would cover my rent for 3 months after release unexpectedly couldn't cover the 3rd month, so I HAVE to get money stashed away.

This place is sketchy ass hell and still to this day I'm waiting on a $440 check to come in the mail when they had a payroll error, the fire department came and shut down like half of our operations one day due to safety, dude... It's bad. Anyways, long story long, I twisted my knee OUTSIDE of work, and dumbass and people pleaser that I am, I continued to work on it for 4 days, hoping to rest up Thanksgiving weekend and get back to it on Monday.

Monday comes and I'm on my feet for 16 fucking hours, I worked 8 and then had to do stuff outside of work, no car and only the bus so! I literally was dragging myself home at the end of the night, wanted to just lay down and die. I go into work yesterday, tell them my knee is fucked and I've been pushing it because, oh, forgot to mention, if you miss ONE SHIFT in the first 90 days for ANY reason, you're gone. 

I go to urgent care and they tell me it's a pretty bad sprain, RICE and take this prescription for 3 days. I say I have to work and the doctors just like ""nah dude lol, we're gonna get you some time off"" and I'm just like WTF? Can't explain my life to this guy so whatever I guess.

I read online that unless I want to risk fucking my knee up permanently, (I'm 25), id better kick back and take the doctors orders, at least for ONE day. I call in this morning, knowing it's gonna be a fucking ordeal with them because this is a toxic and gross workplace, but I NEED the money for rent right now. And I call the office for 2 hours before I finally decided 45 minutes before my shift to call my manager directly, which they get pissy about.

He tells me tough shit pretty much, tell the office and see what happens. I'm pretty much done with the weird ass energy at this place at this point, not trying to vent about it too much but it's pretty much runny ex cons who think they're the shit because they learned a trade/got an opportunity, and now feels like to me that they think they're better than others or something, I try my best to be a genuine human being, Im Christian so i try to practice those morals, not to sin, etc. I really do.

So, here we are. I'm frustrated because I have a big heart and I came out here from a fucked up, drug addicted and trauma fueled life before, used prison as my damn chrysalis to come out as a new, sober, better me, and it feels like I just got hit by a mack truck.

Pretty sure I just got fired because it literally hurts every time I take a step, and my job is lifting heavy shit by hand, so it's not only actual torture for me, it's a safety hazard to those I work with if my knee buckles. I don't really care if I get hurt, but I don't want to hurt or kill anyone else by accident all out of this dynamic I'm in right now. I have zero money, I have to go donate plasma just to be able to pay for the prescription for my knee injury(steroids), another reason I didn't want to work today. Not just rest but I can't work a 8 hour shift and then go try to do errands again with an injury, it almost took my leg out last time.

If you actually read all this, thanks. I'm just confused as hell right now and part of me knows what to do, fuck this stupid job, go out and apply everywhere after my leg has healed and get a real job, boss up, etc. all I do is eat, sleep and breathe motivational, spiritual, healthy stuff lol, it drives my roommates here nuts.

But it's that lower nature or whatever calling out to me right now, and I only know that through what I learned through therapy, which I guess, full circle, brings me right back to this awesome online village, once again asking for help but in a different way.

I think I can handle it on the money front, I'll beg my parents or something even though it makes me feel worse than a cockroach after all they've done for me already. And I know what I NEED to do like on a ""how to get my shit together, save money, and make sure this never happens again"" situation, but I guess what I'm trying to say out of ALL of this incoherent, confusing ass vent of a post is,

Those of us who did time know getting the wheels rolling after release is pretty tough. I never had much in the way of family or financial support, and have actually ZERO healthy social or emotional supports at the moment, so. 

I feel like I'm in hell right now and I have no way out, and everybody fucking hates me and I'm drowning with all this weight dragging me down and no matter how strong I think I am, no matter how hard I try to fight it, it's not even that it wins and ""drags me down"", I've been there before and know what that shit is, I can handle it. But it's this in between, anxiety, stuck in the mud, please help feeling type of feeling. Like fucking emotional waterboarding or something. The only thing keeping me from snapping and just going crazy with drugs, alcohol, risky behaviors, sin etc is God. I lean on Him now and I think that's the only way I'm still here, different strokes for different folks but. That's my experience.

I think I lost the plot at some point and it just turned into a vent but, doesn't matter. If anyone cares to respond or take some time just to drop a nugget, please do. I really need it right now and it would be more appreciated than you'll ever know. God bless and have a great day.",9,14.0,2024-12-04 14:12:55,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1h6gy5k/please_read_released_in_sept/
1h5zrg9,post,RSO finally was hired into a good job,"200+ applications, 8 months of searching, 20+ interviews, multiple failed background checks.

I took the advice of the gentleman on this sub Reddit group. 
I told the employer on the very first phone call that I had an old felony from 16 years ago that was holding me back. To my surprise, the phone interviewer told me that he also has a felony record and that it was not a big deal he would put a good word in with me with the owner of the company to my surprise, I was hired into my Work industry of HVAC. 75,000+ salary a year.

Lessons learned… I should not take jobs for granted anymore. It is becoming more and more difficult to be employed in my situation and I need to treat every job like it’s my last. Do not take anything for granted.

Honesty is the only policy for us because society wants us to disclose. We have to get comfortable telling our story. 

Sobriety is key and  a big reason why I was fired from my last job.  I had an alcohol and marijuana smoking addiction. I have since become seven months sober and I need to stay sober. 

Don’t give up! Keep trying and take anything you can get. Hope is out there, we just have to strive for it.

1h5g1aq,post,How an RSO found happiness many years after sentencing.,"Once upon a time, there lived a very sad man, a lonely man who self isolated, did not have developed hobbies outside of work home wash, rinse, and repeat. He was very depressed and didn’t have many friends. Until one day while walking alone outside on the docks of his local town, he saw a bunch of Salsa dancers dancing in the middle of summer. They welcome him to join in and dance with them and everyone rotated partners they were all friends, supportive, loving, and caring of one another. They invited him to take classes with them and to join in dance socials and to go on trips and vacations, and they invited him into their homes on Thanksgiving and Christmas and soon enough, he joined a performance dance team for both men and women and he was inspired to become a dance teacher, where he’s taking classes to get ballroom certifications now.

His life is full and rich of social community , interactions and love and he met a beautiful woman who is now his girlfriend and she loves dancing with him and they have a wonderful relationship.

Through dance performance, he’s learned to overcome his social anxiety, his paranoia and fear, and whenever someone discovers that he’s an RSO he’s confidently able to explain his story his situation, his life changes and he gains allies and support from the community because he’s built a community of allies and supporters… all of the major promoters in his town know of his offense because he practices disclosure and honesty and he would never do anything to reoffend and ruin the beautiful community that he created for himself because it’s the most sacred and special thing in his world.

He encourages anyone and all men to join theater or performance arts and music as an outlet to feel connected to the world. When this man dances he creates beautiful art and the pain and hurt and ignorance of his past cannot haunt him.

1h50a7t,post,My husband lost his job due to his charge.,"to make a long story short, my husband is the one with a charge against him. It’s been very difficult but about a year ago he lost his job. (he had the job before he was arrested. They did not fire him until after that, this is done and in the past, I know we probably could’ve done some thing about it, but it happened a while ago)

He was obviously forced to find a new job. I don’t wanna get into specifics, but my health is not good, and I’ve been forced to sign up for Social Security disability, we are still in the process of going through trial for that but my husband has lost all ambition. He got a new job, but this new job pays less than $20 an hour and we are drowning. It’s kind of a complicated situation because my parents also have a lot of control over our lives because of me getting sick.

It took a really long time to find this job. He is not interested or motivated in looking for anything else. I’ve been trying to work with my caseworker if there’s anything I can do and she says there are programs to help someone like this in this situation, but I don’t know where to turn to. My husband will not look into anything. He has too much pride and refused to swallow it. I understand I’m not upset at him. I just want our lives to be miserable and to be able to afford basic things like food and toilet paper.

It was really hard for me to even reach out for help here. I don’t often feel like I can talk about this because nobody understands, and they usually judge me pretty severely. 

Are there programs to help somebody who is a SA, find a decent paying job? Or even job training for something that he could do. He is a very smart man and has the potential to do great things but he made one mistake and it’s going to haunt all of us forever. i’ve already decided that I would live with this, but I can’t continue to keep going on like this without our basic needs met. How can I help him?",8,11.0,2024-12-02 17:23:43,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1h50a7t/my_husband_lost_his_job_due_to_his_charge/

1h4kr1u,post,Probably going to Prison (UPDATE),"Long story short, I didn’t go to Prison. I was extremely lucky and the judge handed me a 18 months suspended sentence, 12 months probation (including 180 hours unpaid work/community service). I was also subject to 5 years to SHPO (sexual harm prevention orders - which basically means they sometimes check my devices and I cannot erase any internet data) and 10 years on the registry. 

On the date of my trial (which was around 6 months ago now) my solicitor/ barrister both told me to expect at least a 4 years custodial sentence (prison) and I did. I spent what I thought were my last few hours of freedom with my family going out to eat and stuff before my hearing. However during the trial, some of the “main” charges were dismissed as they didn’t have enough evidence as well as being 17 at the time I committed the crime. I felt as if a boulder just got lifted of my shoulder, the past 2-3 years was full of worry and uncertainty, I was even scared to answer the door to my house because I didn’t know if it was the police or something coming to lock me up. 

Since then I have just been working still, made some new friends (that don’t know) and slowing chipping away at my unpaid work (around 120 hours left)and overall everything’s is going good. I turn 20 in 15 days and me and some friends are planning to go to Amsterdam for the weekend.

P.S. I also told my girlfriend about my situation and offences around a week after the court trial and she was VERY supportive and understanding of me. However I did break up with her due to some other circumstances, but we still keep in touch. 

Finally, I just wanted to thank everyone that commented on my last post and even those who dmed me helping me get through that dark time in my life and if there’s one message I wanna share with everyone reading is that “there is always a light at the end of the tunnel”.

I am now trying to find a career that would be lenient to my criminal history while utilizing my degree.

My criminal history is non-violent, and is a single offense. It was a state felony conviction of one charge that was closed as a misdemeanor and I was determined lowest risk tier by my state (ND) registration.

My resume is made of entry-level jobs in medicine, and I don't have much work experience outside patient care. I am most curious if anyone here knows of companies, perhaps in food science or materials research, that employ biochemistry and practice fair-chance hiring.

I've also looked at going back to school. Veterinary school seems more competitive than even medical school. I'd bet that I could get into a law school, but I doubt that I'd be allowed to take the bar and get licensed, after talking with the state bar assoc.

I like talking through a screen because it gets me time to think and a pause between talking without being awkward. It's really hard for me to talk to female's and try to strike up a conversation without being a creep or weird.

I used to be a Video* gamer but since I got out I have loss interest in it. I try to play every now and than but I just don't care. I work at the same shitty job I had before being locked up. I work about around 40ish a week making $12hr. Can't find a good paying job the doesn't have you working 12hr hours in one day. Housing is ok for now. I have a family that cares about me. But in the end I have lost interest in a lot of things I used to like. I either work, sleep, YouTube, or go over my parents. I don't do much of anything else. I go shopping for food and stuff but I just rather stay home.

I try to be happy, but it's hard for me to do so. I am just tired of being lonely, I would like to have a girlfriend. I don't really have friends, just one or two people I talk to. I am just slowly losing my mind. I went to therapy and all. It was kinda helpful but it didn't help with things that's outside their abilities to do so.

How do you find happiness or contentment in life with things so restrictive? Or am I just using that as a crutch in my life? ",8,12.0,2024-12-01 18:38:21,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1h4a1u1/finding_happiness/

You chose the number and the frequency(when to register, which is important if your honeless)

Alot of RSOs fail to register, so why not provide them with a reminder. 

How would it work?
How would you secure the numbers that register?

what do you all think of my ideas.? 🤓🤓🧐

1h43pe7,post,15 Days Left: A Journey of Growth and Redemption,"Today marks exactly 15 days until I am officially off probation. It’s been a long journey, but one that has transformed me in ways I never imagined. After being released early on house arrest, I took a bold step and petitioned the court to allow me to move out of the country. That petition was granted, and my probation was switched to unsupervised. For the past three years, I’ve been living abroad, working on bettering myself in every possible way.

I have 5 more years left until I can petition the court for removal, and while it might seem like a long time, I see it as an opportunity to keep building the life I want.

I’ve invested in my growth and healing, including starting therapy—not because I had to, but because I wanted to understand where things went wrong and ensure they never happen again. That decision has been life-changing. I’ve also enrolled in college and am currently pursuing a Master’s degree online, a milestone I once thought was out of reach.

Professionally, I’ve been blessed with incredible opportunities back home in the U.S., receiving job offers with the salary I desire. I’ve chosen to work on contracts rather than direct hire to navigate around background checks while still proving my value and expertise if I decide to move back home to the U.S.

This post isn’t just about me—it’s about encouragement. Whether you’re facing time, just getting out, or grinding to move forward, keep your head up and stay strong. Growth is possible. Change is real. And the future is bright if you’re willing to put in the work. Stay focused, stay determined, and never stop striving for better.",10,6.0,2024-12-01 13:51:38,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1h43pe7/15_days_left_a_journey_of_growth_and_redemption/

1h3vsdv,post,BF is a RSO. I need support..,"Hi, first time here.. Im not looking for legal advice but would appreciate any emotional support right now and i need to vent with others who have dealt with something similar. 

I was in a bad relationship in FL that ended with me being charged with DV charges for defending myself.. got out of that relationship and moved back closer to my family in TN. I met this wonderful man through FB Dating and we have clicked from the very start in May. We recently found out that we have crossed paths the few times I’ve had to visit TN and I had even made remarks to a friend about the really cute construction guy 3 yrs ago. The cute construction guy being my now boyfriend. He told me from the very start about his felony sex offense and being a RSO for life since he was charged in LA. 

Im currently in a custody battle with my sociopath exhusband (maybe not a sociopath, but very parental alienation-like). Everything has been going in my favor with my DV charges being dismissed in February where i can have it expunged and im so close to getting custody back of my children. Well, now my exhusband got a whiff of my new friend and did some research on him. Now my boyfriend is being forced to testify in court, requested to be in court for the final hearing. Everything that is done in public or posted on social media is kept very FRIENDS ONLY strict between the boyfriend and I. So my exhusband is finding annnnnnny little thing to bring to court. 

Im worried about what theyre going to ask him or what theyre going to say about our relationship.. which we have discussed an engagement and a ring is being saved up for currently, that plan was accidentally exposed the other day because he didnt know i was in the next room. Then he had to partially admit to what he said to his friend over the phone. So im excited for that!! He has been the best boyfriend ever. Hes very supportive, encouraging, and loving. Hes my own personal cheerleader. I love him so much! We have discussed his felony and the possibility of having a baby when we are married and ready. 

Im afraid my exhusband will try to find a way to have him put back in jail and i really need some encouraging words because ive been crying off and on that he may get taken from me over a bitter exhusband. 

Again.. i dont need legal advice. I just need emotional support because im really struggling with this right now. I just love him so much and i need this man in my life. I dont want to lose him.",6,46.0,2024-12-01 05:04:25,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1h3vsdv/bf_is_a_rso_i_need_support/

1h3kbi1,post,Presence and Residency Restrictions while travelling,"I am living in WA state and have a trip planned to GA with my family next year. I would be in GA less than 24 hours, though overnight. I have contacted the county sheriff to find if there are any restrictions and was told I could not be within 1,000 ft of pools, gyms, or churches during my stay which excluded the hotels and bed and breakfast places I found. I was given ""special permission"" to stay at a Super 8, which includes a pool (as most southern hotels do). I am not required to register, but to text the officer when I get into town. My understanding from my research was that one would not have to register unless staying 14 days, so I wondered if the presence/residency restrictions could be applied to non-registering travelling offenders on a temporary visit within the ""grace period"". I wondered whether or not these actions on behalf of police are an overreach and unlawful, or whether they are fear-driven and provided from ignorance of the law. I've contacted SOR for additional information and have not heard back, but according to this guide from blogger ATwoZee, the presence restrictions do not apply to visitiors in GA, [50 state POST-REG Sept 2024.pdf - Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DDepUA3LIKJ2PHs5mCQ7I13ADhM_Z-6e/view) , If anyone has any general advice on this topic, I feel this is a specific niche question that might need better clarification, though I understand the answer could depend on the state.",1,7.0,2024-11-30 19:31:48,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1h3kbi1/presence_and_residency_restrictions_while/

1h34oj5,post,For what it's worth,"Today, we, my 4 roommates and I found out that our 6th roommate is an RSO.

He had all his stuff packed before we all even got home and was trying to get it packed into his Aunt's car when half of us got home.

We found out because a coworker of his found his name listed on the registry and started spamming the other coworkers social media. One of those coworkers knows two of the roommates and I'm sure you can imagine the aftermath. We live in a western small town and there were threats of violence, especially from the type of guys who like to beat women and abuse animals.

When we got home we could see how distraught he was and we told him he didn't have to go even though we knew that one roommate is not happy and wants him kicked out. He finished packing his things up and drove to a motel that his aunt is helping him with.

I talked to his aunt briefly before they left while he was still packing things. He's been our roommate for almost a year and a half and I've met her a bunch of times. Never had an issue with him. I'm a younger 30 something bisexual female who not once felt unsafe with him. He was always very respectful and hard working. He has always had more than one job as long as I have known him and he was always doing cash jobs mowing lawns, doing headlights or brakes for a few bucks, raked leaves and did some snow removal. I know he has been putting some savings into crypto to try and leave the country. He didn't get too political but was always saying how this country isn't for him.

Now it all makes sense.

His aunt said that this last job was the longest he had. 17 months. It's always the same. He gets a job, does well, moves up because he's a smart guy and then eventually someone finds out he's an RSO and then he has to rebuild his whole life again. He's in his 40s now. 

She explained how he got his charge when he was on leave from the military on his 21st birthday and met a girl at a party who was 15 and got a blow job. The girl's ex boyfriend told the school counselor and within 3 weeks had half the party attendants gave statements. He got an OTH discharge and pled to state charge that got him 17-23 months back in the late 90s but he didn't have to register. When he moved to New York for a job, he was forced to register for the remainder of 10 years from the sentencing, but in 2007 he was changed to lifetime because of new laws. He applied for removal and has been denied multiple times.

He's had a clean record since.

I'm so fucking angry right now. I don't understand why we don't help these kinds of people. I never understood how everyday is living under terror and anxiety. How are they ever supposed to reassimilate when we purposely ostracize and even systemically harass them? 

How can I help him? How can I help all of them? Like, shouldn't they get remote work? They can't pass a background how the fuck are they going to get a job?  Like any real job?  His job at the factory is gone now even if he wanted to go back there.

*Text Summary:*

# Bridging Humanity and Justice

*with PA Executive Deputy Attorney General Robert Reed, Esq.* 

At the heart of the 2024 PARSOL Fall Conference’s opening plenary, Pennsylvania Executive Deputy Attorney General Robert Reed, Esq.  delivered an impassioned address centered on justice, empathy, and systemic reform. This keynote captured the challenges marginalized individuals face and proposed transformative strategies to create trauma-informed systems that honor humanity. Reed’s presentation illuminated the path toward a compassionate and equitable society through anecdotes, policy insights, and a heartfelt call to action.

**A Vision Rooted in Justice and Empathy**  
Reed’s keynote began with a powerful reflection on his career-long commitment to justice. Drawing from his 30-plus years in the U.S. Department of Justice, Reed acknowledged the complexities of striving for fairness within imperfect systems. He underscored that empathy and respect must underpin efforts to reform organizations like the Department of Corrections, which have historically perpetuated cycles of trauma for both the incarcerated and those working within these environments.

Highlighting PARSOL's mission, Reed praised its dedication to a justice model centered on prevention, dignity, and trauma-informed care. ""We need to have a society that sees each other as human,"" he asserted, emphasizing the critical need for compassion in policymaking and advocacy.

**Understanding Trauma as a Root Cause**  
Central to Reed’s address was acknowledging trauma as a foundational factor influencing behavior and societal outcomes. He pointed to the work of trauma expert Sandy Bloom, who has spent decades advocating for systems that address the emotional wounds affecting individuals and communities. Reed emphasized that trauma-informed approaches are essential across sectors, including the education, healthcare, and justice systems.

For instance, he described efforts to train Pennsylvania police officers on trauma sensitivity, a groundbreaking initiative to change interactions between law enforcement and the public. Similarly, the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections has begun educating its staff on trauma, marking a critical step toward systemic change.

**Safety and the Scourge of Scams**  
During a recent conversation with PARSOL staff, Reed became aware of the wide extent to which scammers actively use registry data, including employers, home addresses, vehicle information, etc., to target registrants.

Reed spoke candidly about the pervasive insecurity in modern society, from unsafe cultural environments to the prevalence of financial scams targeting vulnerable populations, including scams against individuals on the registry for sexual offenses, exploiting their fear and isolation. 

His message was clear: awareness and self-advocacy are key defenses against such threats. ""Nobody from the government is going to call you up and ask for money,"" he stressed, urging attendees to verify claims and report fraudulent activity. ""Scams aren't just a consumer protection issue; it's people breaking the law.""

Reed shared four critical facts about scams:

1. Scammers pretend to be from an organization you know, such as the police, parole or probation, the courts, etc., or from an organization threatening you with blackmail.
2. Scammers propose a problem or prize, such as missing a court date, technical issues with supervision or registration, or obtaining exploitative information about you.
3. Scammers pressure you to act immediately.
4. Scammers tell you to pay money in a specific, often untraceable way, such as cryptocurrency, gift cards, or cash.

**Trauma-Informed Justice: From Courtrooms to Prisons**  
“A trauma-informed justice system extends to all levels, from courts to correctional facilities,” added Reed, who detailed efforts to create trauma-sensitive juvenile and criminal justice systems in Pennsylvania. He cited the inclusion of reentry courts designed to provide collaborative, rehabilitative opportunities for individuals leaving incarceration.

Especially inspiring to conference attendees was Reed’s engagement with incarcerated individuals where he witnessed transformative moments of self-realization and hope. ""People are almost stunned to hear that they can heal and recover,"" he shared. These interactions underscore the importance of addressing childhood trauma as a predictor of future behavior and advocating for restorative practices over punitive measures.

**Community Engagement, the PA Reentry Council, and Change**  
Throughout the plenary, Reed emphasized the role of lived experience in fostering understanding and driving change. Stories, he noted, humanize abstract policy discussions and reveal the systemic failings that often trap individuals in cycles of harm. He highlighted initiatives like the Pennsylvania Reentry Council (PARC), which brings diverse stakeholders together to address reintegration barriers, including housing, employment, and education.

Reed thanked PARSOL staff, including managing director John Dawe, legislative director Randall Hayes, and board members Lisa Perry and Lisa Kessler-Peters, who serve in volunteer leadership roles within PARC, including heading a special committee on reentrants with sex offenses.

**The Road Ahead: A Call to Action**  
“Change is brewing,” Reed declared, urging attendees to join efforts to build a more humane society. From training police officers and judges to creating trauma-informed schools and communities, he painted a picture of progress fueled by empathy, collaboration, and persistence.

He also underscored the importance of personal resilience, advising attendees to prioritize their mental and emotional well-being. He suggested that simple practices like mindfulness and cultivating supportive relationships can help individuals navigate the stress of advocacy and systemic challenges.

In closing, Reed encouraged individuals to share their stories, citing the profound impact of personal narratives in changing perspectives. By integrating stories of lived experience in advocacy, trauma-informed training sessions, and system reform, decision-makers can better understand the realities faced by those they aim to serve.

1h11nsb,post,My story so far. Adivce?,"I am still pending charges in OR. Felony b. I was caught up in a civilian sting. Unfortunately I do not have the money for a 30k lawyer, so I've been with a public defender.. he seems okay. I've been through 2 early resolution hearings. DA has given me a plea of 14 months and lifetime registration. My lawyer told me not to take it. I haven't had any priors, not even a speeding ticket. My ex gf whom I love so much left me due to the stigmatizam. I had a very good job, which I also lost because I was honest with my boss (now realizing was a mistake to trust.) I was super fortunate to find kindness and understanding with my mom, so I am currently living with her. Unfortunately no job, and zero luck finding a job, i have applied honestjobs, indeed, and Craigslist. I feel like I'm just draining her resources and I hate it. My life crumbled because of a stupid decision i made.

My trail is approaching, and I have no idea what to expect. My public defender hasnt been very good at communicating. As I said, DA is ""offering"" 14 months, and at this point, I feel like I should just take it. I live in full anxiety, afraid to go outside, even the front yard, much less the Walmart or Safeway. Though, never gone to prison/jail before (expect for the initial arrest and bond) I'm scared. Is probation better? Or just suck it up an go?

Just venting now: is it worth it? Is it worth the future? I use to think my life would be happy but I can't see light at the end of the tunnel anymore. I knew my ex for 10years, and we went through so much( mostly her bullshit) but this time I fucked up and I feel like my life is just done. I'm 32, and I wonder who would ever love me now. Is it worth it? I know I'm just at the beginning of this whole thing and I hate to say it, but I've already given up. I have read a bit on the thread, and I hear some good stories, but a lot is difficulties traveling, vacations, moving and just living. But is it worth it? 

Just a lot of unknown and I hate it.. I fucked up and I feel like the life I had is over, and I really liked the life I had. Sorry for the rant but yall are my only friends now. ",0,17.0,2024-11-27 10:53:08,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1h11nsb/my_story_so_far_adivce/

1h0otwm,post,What to expect: Ohio,"A week and a half ago my apartment was raided by the local police on an investigation of Pandering Obscenity Involving a Minor. I fell into a bad spot and ended up with some CP from some group chats and individuals on an app. I guess I'm making this post as to what to expect. 

My first mistake was talking with the investigator and admitting to possession on some material. I'm still in contact with him regarding receiving evidence back, which I have received some back already last week. I can't really afford a lawyer either unfortunately since I'm already living paycheck to paycheck. My first question is has anyone had experiences with PD's in the state of Ohio?

My other questions are on what to expect. The detective gave me a rough timeline. Between 1-2 months after the initial raid I should expect charges to be brought up, and up to 6 months until actual sentencing. My biggest concerns are my cat and the fact that I have no family in this state. Is it likely that if I receive parole I'll have to stay in this state or could I make a plea deal to move back in with family?

What should I expect in terms of jail/prison? I'm being investigated in Medina County and it seems like feds are not involved whatsoever. How is prison for SO in this state and where would I most likely go? I have a clean record and this is my first offense so this is all new to me.

One more thing. I have a feeling once charges are brought up I'll loose my job. I don't work with children but I don't see this helping me stay at my job during the trial period. Is unemployment a likely option during this period if I do get fired?

There's a lot of stuff going through my mind as of now. I already have counseling setup that I was recommended to by the detective. I want to fix myself and start life again.",4,6.0,2024-11-26 22:30:42,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1h0otwm/what_to_expect_ohio/

1h04lts,post,Recently found out husband had multiple hidden cameras in our home and is now getting treated for alleged porn addiction after getting caught ,"I have never posted anything in Reddit in my life but I am really struggling and hoping I can get some guidance here. I am a 33 yo female married to a 31 yo male for 3 years & together for 8+ years. We have had our fair share of issues as I have moved to two different states to support his schooling and career path. I noticed when we moved the first time his behavior and treatment of me gradually started to change in a negative way. He became very controlling and accusatory… when we moved the second time right after we got married is when I noticed the real change in his gaslighting, manipulative, financially abusive behaviors. I realize this is vague but just to give some background it feels that these behaviors started slowly but surely and amplified by a dozen when we finally moved half way across the country and I was very isolated. Anyway, there have been a number of trust issues on his part because I started to cope in unhealthy ways with drinking. Got to the point where he would give me set rules - “no drinking on Mondays” “you can have 2 glasses but that’s it  on certain days” … I admit and am not proud of the fact I was drinking a lot to cope w moving and adapting to a new place etc. but it always felt like overkill.  Fast forward to September … I have 4 of my best girlfriends from my hometown come visit us and it was a big production and a big deal bc they have never visited and I was very excited to have my friends stay over and have some familiarity.
Last day of the trip one of the girls saw an essential oil diffuser while bathing in guest bathroom. She wanted to use it and examined it and found there was a camera. Then saw the bottom of it contained an SD slot for memory card. My husband was staying at his parents house a couple miles away but came back to the house and was freaking out. I did not know what was happening at the time and we went to the beach. My husband keeps calling incessantly saying my friend “stole” something from us and if we don’t get it back “we could be in serious legal trouble” she and other girls told me they found one camera and then searched house and found others. At first my husband was blaming it on me, that he had no choice but to put hidden cameras up in our home bc he was worried about me and my “alcohol abuse” he was saying he had no choice but to monitor me bc we were just about to start seriously trying to have kids. Anyway, I went back home with my girlfriends on their flight to process this all away from him. I decided to move back to where we live but I was staying with a friend until I felt safe enough to go back to our home. He admitted at some point in between this that he had 12 hidden cameras and that they were all just to watch me. I got back to where we live and moved into my friends and that was my plan until we went to couples therapy to see if we could work through it. Three days back, I get a call from him saying the local police had a search warrant for invasion of privacy and basically they confiscated his phone and searched our house. I did not know this but my friends watched the SD card they found and what they saw was extremely disturbing. Once it got legal my husband admitted that the cameras were not just for me and that he had been filming other people and that it actually all started about 4 years ago. I had absolutely no clue he was filming me and my friends without consent and in really vulnerable situations. The second it got legal he lawyered up and his attorney told him to go to sex addiction rehab for porn and he left for 42 days. No charges have been brought yet but I moved back into the home and got locks changed, a security system and got a private investigator to do a sweep. 

Has anyone ever dealt with anything like this? The worst part is that he hasn’t shown an ounce of remorse and every interaction we’ve had has been in defense of his case. He went as far as to ask me to be a character witness and told his lawyer I was his ally and I immediately told him he had the wrong idea about that. Im in shock and traumatized completely. My friends are all so traumatized and therefore haven’t been able to provide me support so I feel he has completely isolated me. I’m just confused and hoping if anyone else may have insight to this type of voyeuristic disorder and abuse they could give me their input. Thank you so much for listening.

Anyhow, if you’re still here and don’t hate my guts. I’m a skilled , trade school graduate of HVAC. I thought the trades would save me from poverty and unemployment but it’s still is a great issue.

I have been unemployed since March of this year. I’ve had some luck starting my own HVAC business doing residential and light commercial jobs without a contracting license. So in other words because California won’t hire me to work legitimately I have to do things illegal and work without a license. Funny how the system sets you up to fail, huh? Anyhow I have applied for over 200 jobs in the last eight months and I’ve been on probably 20 interviews 15 resulted in hires on the spot only to be denied. Once the background check results came through. I need some help finding work … the only places in my town that will hire me are … picking up garbage at dump yards. Or recyclers. And I am much more qualified than that. I also hold a bachelors degree in education..

Any tips on how I can find work? The California fair chance act is useless for sex offenders. I feel that I’m severely discriminated against.

I use indeed and Craigslist.


( Update ) 

Yes I’ve tried being honest during interviews, I have letters of recommendations from friends and prior employers. Nothing works.

1gxgtnk,post,"NEWS RELEASE: PARSOL Condemns the Tragic Killing of Jesse Grover, Victim of the Public ‘Sex Offender’ Registry","* ***Read and react to this full story at*** [***https://parsol.org/jesse-grover-death/***](https://parsol.org/jesse-grover-death/) 

**November 22, 2024** — The [Pennsylvania Association for Rational Sexual Offense Laws](https://parsol.org/) (PARSOL.org) mourns the tragic and senseless death of Jesse Michael Grover, a 31-year-old resident of Sharon, Pennsylvania, whose inclusion on the public “sex offender” registry for an offense more than ten years ago, appears to have made him a target for gun violence. Jesse was killed on November 17, 2024, in an act of vigilante violence, a tragedy that underscores the grave dangers created by public access to the registry.

According to his [obituary](https://www.mcgoniglefuneralhomeandcrematory.com/obituaries/print?o_id=9130252), “Jesse was a kind and compassionate person who was much beloved by many in his community, known by all for his gentle demeanor and his continual push towards self-improvement. Born in Houston, Tx., and adopted at age two, Jesse grew up in Greenville, Pa., graduating from Greenville High School in 2012. He was a loving partner, a devoted stepfather, and a cherished friend to many. Jesse enjoyed music, reading, cooking, and spending time with loved ones.”

“Jesse’s death is an unimaginable loss for his family, friends, community, and for a society that failed to protect him. The public ‘sex offender’ registry, which purportedly exists to enhance public safety, has once again proven to be a tool of harm,” remarked PARSOL chair Josiah Krammes of Pottsville. “By publishing the names and addresses of registrants, the registry exposes individuals to harassment, violence, and even murder.”

“The Pennsylvania legislature and policymakers nationwide must recognize the devastating consequences of this policy,” added PARSOL Legislative Director Randall Hayes of Harrisburg. “Jesse’s murder is not an isolated event; it is part of a disturbing trend of violence against people whose names appear on the registry. PARSOL has long maintained that the public registry is a flawed and dangerous civil regulatory scheme.""

“As long ago as 2013, the National Assoc. for Rational Sexual Offense Laws (NARSOL) cited multiple vigilante murders and serious injuries facilitated by the sex offender registry. In response to the especially heinous murder of Charles and Gretchen Parker in South Carolina, we appealed to then-governor Nikki Haley to at least remove the home addresses of registrants from the registry,” said Sandy Rozek, NARSOL communications director. “The appeal was disregarded.”

“Not only is the registry ineffective,” added PARSOL Managing Director John Dawe of Dallas. “It perpetuates lifelong stigma, undermines rehabilitation, and endangers the lives of registrants and their families. Worse, it fails to deliver on its promise of making communities safer. Research consistently shows that public registries do not reduce sexual reoffense rates and instead foster a false sense of security. PARSOL condemns the public ‘sex offender’ registry in the strongest terms and calls for its immediate repeal or significant reform. Jesse’s death should serve as a turning point, compelling lawmakers to prioritize evidence-based policies over fear-driven rhetoric.”

“To Jesse’s family and loved ones, PARSOL extends our deepest condolences. We honor Jesse’s memory by continuing our advocacy for rational, fair, and effective sexual offense laws that protect public safety without endangering lives or perpetuating injustice.”

1gxdlm0,post,The registry kills ,"


One of my biggest fears for when my bf gets out of prison and is forced to register. 

This story is out of Pennsylvania from last week. 

SHARON, Pa. (WKBN) — One person is dead after a shooting Sunday morning in Sharon.
At around 8:30 a.m., Sharon police responded to the 300 block of Logan Avenue for reports of a gunshot victim, according to a press release from Sharon police.

When officers arrived, they found 31-year-old Jesse Grover, of Sharon, with a gunshot wound.

Officers provided medical aid, but Grover died.
At around 8:30 a.m., Sharon police responded to the 300 block of Logan Avenue for reports of a gunshot victim, according to a press release from Sharon police. Police said 25-year-old Portez Smith, of Sharon, has been arrested and charged with criminal homicide and carrying a firearm without a license.

According to a criminal complaint, a witness who was at Grover’s house at the time of the shooting reported that they woke up to Smith screaming on the front porch of Grover’s home. Smith lives upstairs in the duplex, the complaint stated.
The witness told police that Smith was yelling, “Grover, you’re a f*cking ped0phile. Get off of Logan Avenue.”

The witness said when they opened the door to confront Smith, Smith pulled out a gun and immediately shot Grover in the chest.

Police said Smith was there when officers arrived, and he was immediately taken into custody. Police said Smith admitted to shooting Grover in an interview with police.

According to Pennsylvania’s Megan’s Law website, Grover was a Tier 1 registered sex offender. He was convicted of a charge of corruption of minors in 2015 and had registered the address on Logan Avenue as his residence.

He had a 1 minute phone call allowed but we couldn’t get any information from him beyond that he’s okay so we have no idea how to get him minutes for the phone, how to add to his commissary, or anything. 

He’s not listed on the prisons inmate list or the BOPs inmate list. 

What are we supposed to do to be able to talk to him or allow him to get the things he needs? Does it this normally take a few days to get everything set up? It’s now been 24 hours since he went into custody and we’re just completely lost. ",6,8.0,2024-11-22 16:53:54,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gxcefr/federal_inmate_in_county/

1gwpxs9,post,Served by Publication,"I currently have a no contact order with the Mother of my child. My crime did not involve our child and my charge was Voyeurism in the state of Ohio. I was told by my local Domestic Relations court that I have to have the Mother of my child's address on the affidavit needed to be filed in order to start the legal process for visitations. Unfortunately with my no contact order, I cannot provide an accurate address

I did hire an attorney for my criminal case last year who I recently talked to about how to go about getting visitations with my child who I haven't seen/talked to in just over 2 years. He mentioned that I could legally serve the paperwork to the Mother of my child by a process called Serve by Publication. I guess it's an ad posted in the local paper once a week for 6 weeks and after 6 weeks it would be considered properly served.

My question is, has anybody on here had to go through this process? Or if anybody on here has gone through filing for visitation in Ohio that could maybe give some advice about what you had to go through in order to see your child/children? I miss my child dearly and before my crime I was never absent from their life for more than a day or 2. Was really hoping to be able to see them for the holidays this year but it's not looking to good 😢.",2,11.0,2024-11-21 20:50:26,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gwpxs9/served_by_publication/

No one is giving clear answers. Our lawyer at first said of course he could be with his child, then changed that at the next court date and said he was sorry he was mistaken, he would have to go through some program first and they would say if he was able to see his daughter or not...and that it could take months, up to a year...is there anyone here in NY, we're not in the city, who has children and gone through this? He is the most amazing father to our baby girl and I don't know how to cope with the reality that he might not be able to see her. I know these people are looking at him like he is a monster but he is not. He is the kindest soul I have ever met. He's never been in trouble, not even a speeding ticket. He's her primary caretaker as he works from home while I work in an office during the day. We live with his mother who never leaves the house, she is older so she can't care for our daughter full time but she watches her now and then while he is on work meetings. If he isn't allowed to live with us or even see our daughter I don't know what I'm going to do. I have no one else to watch her and she cannot attend daycare due to stupid vaccine mandates. Please I just need some clear information on what is going to happen...I haven't been able to sleep, eat, I'm sick over this. We just want the best for our little girl. I don't understand the system.

1guyioo,post,Support is here - Don't give up!,"I just wanted to share a little bit of my story ...how I went from darkness to hope—several years ago, I found myself in a place I wouldn’t wish on anyone. I had no one to lean on, nothing to keep me steady, and I was facing some of the most serious challenges of my life: prison and criminal charges. It felt like the world had crumbled around me, leaving me in a darkness so deep, so overwhelming, that giving up seemed like the easiest way out.

But even in that darkness, there was this faint glimmer of something—a spark of defiance, a tiny ember of hope. I held on to that, even when it felt impossible. I kept going. I pushed through the pain, the fear, and the hopelessness. I was resilient, even when everything in me wanted to give up. And eventually, that little light grew brighter.

Now, life is beautiful in ways I could never have imagined back then. I’ve seen what hope and perseverance can do. I’ve learned that even in the darkest of places, there’s always a chance to turn things around. That tiny light you cling to might be your way out.

I want to share this message: Never give up. No matter how dark it gets, no matter how much you feel like the fight isn’t worth it—keep going. That light, no matter how small, can guide you to a better place. And one day, you’ll look back and see just how far you’ve come.

1guk7nu,post,Housing in NYC ,"Hello everyone,

I am starting the process of looking for an apartment to rent in NYC. I know everyone suggests looking on the registry to see where the SO's live. Unfortunately I am on Federal supervision and can't knowingly live with SO's. As I understand it, it NY there are 4-5 different types of background checks. Some check the registry, some look for financial crimes, some look at state convictions, some look at federal, and some look at everything. Does anyone have any advice given my situation? I am tier 2 (public) for federal possession in 2022. 

If anyone knows of any management companies that rent to SO's, that would also be extremely helpful. ",5,4.0,2024-11-19 00:26:44,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1guk7nu/housing_in_nyc/

Filmed live at the PARSOL 2024 Fall Conference and Symposium on Friday, November 15, 2024.

The Good Lives Model for offender rehabilitation states that if someone who has become dependent on criminal activities (including crimes of a sexual nature) is equipped to live better, pro-social, and personally meaningful lives, their reliance on unhealthy or deviant coping mechanisms will be replaced by acceptable ones. In this workshop, Dr. Jennifer Weeks, a Pennsylvania Sex Offender Assessment Board-Approved treatment provider, will examine the key components of this strengths-based model. Participants will learn how anyone, even non-offenders, can use the Good Lives Model to build a better, more fulfilling life. Dr. Weeks will also briefly overview how the Good Lives Model supports the Risk-Needs-Responsivity (RNR) model championed by the SOAB.

Don't think too much about what you did, think more about what you can do. 

I stressed so much over my charges, the aftermath, and the environments and circumstances I put myself in, that maybe that's one of the reasons why I got cancer. That plus poor diet and poor health all together...

1gsxksx,post,"[Long] Charges dropped, case sealed, off the registry. Tips and experience ","I feel like I should make this post more out of respect than anything else because I used to use this site quite a bit when I was first sentenced. Beginning of 2020 I was sentenced to a 5 year deferred for Attempt on a child. Couple months ago everything was dropped, case was sealed, removed from registry. Now my background is completely clean (unless I'm trying to work in the government which obviously I'm not). My name is gone from the public and I'm just another citizen, not labeled or frowned upon for simply existing.

I won't go into the details of what actually happened, but I will say that everyone I ever told my story to including the police themselves when I had to register didn't exactly agree that I should have been there. I just wanted to make a little timeline of sorts and give some advice to everyone in closing. Theres a million people on here discussing actually getting through classes and probations and all of that, this is more of a post about the process of ENDING it. So here's my guide to finishing off everything and some tips.

  
First, don't jeopardize your relationship with any of your POs. Ever. There is a very specific reason for this that doesn't involve going back to jail, it's about probation itself. I was in classes for about 2 years as part of my sentencing, and when I finished those classes and paid off restitution I took a gamble and made a motion to the court for unsupervised probation. This is literally the best possible thing you can do. Now i understand some of you are on here for probation that lasts 10+ years, but it might be worth a try. As ive talked to other people on probation, they have mandatory classes that they must attend to while on probation. This also includes regular probation officer visits and tests, all the fees, etc. I finished the classes and was still required to go once a month even though i had completed all stipulations of my probation. But obviously I wanted out. 

Now before I continue, I need to stress something. Some people who are in situations such as us (was in my case but I'll just refer to us going forward) need these classes. And that's not in a judgemental way. They Need them because they help, it gives them an outlet for their frustrations, it allows you to connect with those in similar situations, and it helps you feel like you aren't alone. You can learn a lot from them and it really is a give and take, even if you don't learn anything about yourself (which you probably should since none of us are perfect and it's good to reflect) you can help other people with the struggle and make connections. There were a few takeaways from the classes that have stuck with me, specifically how i view relationships and reflecting on the behavior that led up to the situation I was in. There's something to gain from going, no matter how small. 

Regardless, I had done the program and paid my fines and I was tired of going and sick of POs breathing down my neck. My next step was to try and get unsupervised probation. This would mean no classes, no PO, no drug tests, no limit on movement (outside of registration laws). So what I did is I contacted every single one of my POs and asked them to just make a statement saying I was fully compliant in my probation and completed every necessary task. I also got a statement from the counselor in my classes saying I had completed everything and I behaved etc. I got around 3 statements from POs and the statement from the counselor. This was extremely crucial because it looks very good to a prosecutor. Applying for unsupervised probation can be a gamble because it boils down to how the prosecutor feels, risk assessment etc. But getting a bunch of statements saying you did everything right and never caused issues heavily favors you.

This is why I mentioned keeping a good relationship with POs and in your classes. You NEED to be able to have them make statements. Keep in mind these weren't recommendations, they certainly aren't going to bat for you, it's just them saying that yes you did everything and never caused issues, and that will show the prosecutor you are lower risk and more eligible. So I obtained all those statements, sent them to my lawyer, he set a hearing and forwarded to the prosecutor. I was in court for maybe 2 minutes and got approved, no questions. Didn't have to go to classes, no longer had a PO, and I was basically just stuck registering. But I pretty much just did whatever after that. You still had typical probation rules like no alcohol or weapons or anything but as long as you aren't being a moron you should be fine, because no one is there to check on you or test you or having to give you permission. 

  
So for 2 years or so I was on unsupervised, biding my time. At the 4 year mark of my 5 year sentence I was pretty much fed up once again because my status as an SO was keeping me from moving forward. So, I applied to end probation early. Once again, my attorney sent in the statements, he made sure to note I've kept up on my registration, and I haven't gotten in trouble since. Went into court for maybe 5 minutes, DA said he had no objections, judge granted it, done deal. Judge also ordered my case to be sealed because it was a deferred. ​Off probation, good to go.

But not really. I encourage all of you to look up your state laws, but the state that I'm from, just because you they dropped the charges and sealed your case, that doesn't mean you're off the registry. I still had to actually apply to get off the registry. It sounds redundant and frankly idiotic (which it is) but that's how it goes, it's not automatic. Now I was in a unique case where I had a deferred sentence so all my charges were dropped and essentially thrown away, which made me eligible to get off the registry ASAP. I know some of us aren't in that kind of scenario, and have convictions that don't allow them to unregister until certain time periods have passed, but this is still important to listen to. When the charges are dropped or your period is over, you need to IMMEDIATELY send in the forms and petition to get off the registry.

The reason for this is simply timing. It took me 4 months to get my petition approved, meanwhile it took me a couple weeks to get the hearing for my charges to be dropped. That's the court system for you. But I just want to stress this note because the way the petition works is first the DA has to have no objections, and then the judge has to sign off on it. This is super important to know for one reason. The DA has a certain amount of days to object or approve it. In my case it was 60. I live in a big city and these DAs are up to their neck in paperwork, and i would not be surprised if he didnt even look at the petition until the very last day he had just because he knew he had to act on it. So then it gets passed to the judge whl must sign it. If you thought the DA was busy, imagine a judge in one of the biggest cities in the country. He didnt have a time limit because hes, you know, the judge. It took about two months for him to reach my petition and sign off. At that point I reached out to my local law enforcement, they put in for me to unregister, and about two weeks later all the databases were completely updated. Off the registry, case sealed, the public eye wasnt able to see anything about my record. I was done. 

  
Where am I now? Got a tattoo I always wanted, waited this long because I didn't want an identifier in any of my registrations. Also I'm going overseas for about a month in December. Something I wouldn't have been able to do. Got a decent job and a nice place. Things are definitely looking up.

Before I end my post though, there's a few things I want to put out there to all of those still going through it. I think it's important to say these things because my mindset has definitely changed now that I'm out of the thick of it. 

The first being that it sucks. Life is hard, I won't sit there and tell you it's easy because it's not, and being a RSO does not help whatsoever. It's a struggle and the system has flaws, but if you're here you're here. There's no way to speed it up because the system moves at its own pace, so it's easier to just accept that it's going to take time to get through this any way you slice it. Unless the system itself changes then you are in it for the the time you were sentenced to and you have to make the best of it. Stay productive and don't let it weigh you down to trying to better your life even if that's exactly what it does. If you're new, you'll get used to and get out of the slump eventually. 

Second, as I said before, don't get in trouble unless you want to serve that full probation sentence. Whatever it takes have a good relationship with those who have the power to take away your freedom. Kiss ass, yes sir no ma'am, doesn't matter. Swallow your pride and any feelings you have for them or the system and just play ball because that's how it is, even if you don't like it.

Lastly, there is an end to it, or ways to make it easier. You will be limited but as I mentioned above there's a few very crucial things you can do to get your freedom back in some capacity. If you just play ball and do what you're told you are way more likely to be able to be done sooner than later or at least get unsupervised probation. I cannot stress how badly you are going to want to push and get this, because the difference is night and day between being on probation and unsupervised. If you got 5 years you can essentially get 2 or 3 if you behave and do what i told you above. Note that its not guaranteed, but theres too many guys ive seen who ran out their entire probation not even attempting it. You gotta go for it.



And that's about it. If you have any questions about the process, be it going through it, ending it, or after, I plan on reading each comment and answering. ​If not, I appreciate you guys for being a good resource over the years. I've met some good people and learned some things. ​​

the main thing i’m looking for is anything in the way of community. support groups, camaraderie, anything. i know absolutely no one with this experience. i am an only child. this experience has left me struggling with POCD, vaginismus, and a general anxiety around intimacy and closeness as well as trusting myself. whenever i hear of people who have offender parents, their parents never stayed married. but mine are, and i feel like i am going crazy. am i fully alone? i just want to speak to someone who shares my experience a little bit.

1gs3634,post,Ontario CAN. Legislation Changes,"For all the Canadians out there, Ontario’s Solicitor General just announced new legislation/changes to Christopher’s Law that would make ON registration much more similar to the US. You’d now have to register your social media and email accounts, and you wouldn’t be allowed to change your name. (The list isn’t public here like it is in US). 
I don’t see how any of these changes will actually help them solve sex crimes. If you change your name you still have to register with your new name so it wouldn’t make a difference. The only benefit is society can’t search you up on the internet and find the old news reports. Feels like a severe breach of privacy rights. 

This is getting ridiculous. All these politicians using RSOs to make themselves look good in public eye while not actually making any helpful changes.

1grx8i4,post,Email from Maryland DPSCS,"Good info for everyone, espcially in these times. Be vigilant out there.

SCAM ALERT  
  
As you may know, registered sex offenders are often targeted for scams because their personal information is typically readily available online.  We encourage any offenders who believe they were targeted by scammers to report the incident to local law enforcement (not just their local registry contact).  Doing so will aid in tracking efforts and assist in protecting them should an instance of identity theft or fraud presents itself down the line.  Lastly, please remember these few tips to aid in scam prevention...  
  
• The MD Sex Offender Registry cannot and will not accept payment to remove someone  
from the Registry. That would be illegal, and is the first and biggest indication of a  
fraud attempt.  
• Don’t allow a true sex offender registry unit phone number listed on the caller ID to  
fool you. The numbers are listed publicly and can easily be “spoofed” by fraudsters.  
Similarly, fraudsters can impersonate sex offender registry unit members.  
• Don't be swayed by a caller's knowledge of some of your personal information.  Again, some information is located on the website, and some can be obtained through internet searches.    
• Always confirm a sex offender registry unit attempt at contact by calling a number  
listed on a trusted, authentic website.  
• Never provide “validating” personal identifying information over the phone during an  
unsolicited call (i.e., social security #, birthday, etc.).  ",3,2.0,2024-11-15 14:12:31,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1grx8i4/email_from_maryland_dpscs/

Since it's Wisconsin, anything goes, I know, but... Does this seem excessive to anyone? Specifically the lifetime supervision for 1 count possession of cp.

P.S. My now ex-spouse worked for a time for the county in which the charge was filed.

1grhp65,post,Husband and therapy ,"I tried to talk to my husband about therapy today. It did not go well. He talks in circles or makes it so broad in order to make it impossible to talk to him. Like “well if I accept this then I have to accept that it’s fine what they did and how the government has unchecked power and this is why slavery stuck around as long as it did because no one is willing to stand up”. So I suggested joining some groups who are fighting against this and he told me it was no use because nothing was going to change. So what I’m learning is that he wants to be right and his logic needs to be seen as infallible. He’s convinced that he will be so nervous taking the polygraph that they will immediately put him in jail and think he’s lying. So I suggested talking to someone beforehand about that or posting in this group and asking about it. Then he said “well they’ll just say not to be nervous and that won’t be helpful”. He said if he just does the things they’re asking him to do they’ll think he’s happy being a monkey in a cage because he fulfilled the terms of his probation. So there’s no fruitful discussion. It’s all that it will go exactly as he thinks it will so it’s all useless. I’m so exhausted and don’t understand why he needs to be right about everything. He also says he would be happy for me if I left him and that he would end it shortly thereafter. 

For context: he was part of a sting operation. He was on a dating website, the profile said she was 41, but in conversation she said she was 14, he continued to have a sexual conversation with her because he didn’t believe she was underage. They exchanged numbers and had a phone call and she sounded older. He decided to show up to meet her to prove himself right. Well, he was right that it was an adult— it turned out to be an adult policewoman. He took the plea deal because he didn’t want to risk 25+years in jail, not because he believed he did anything wrong.

1grdb0n,post,NY here please help I need information ,"Okay so it's a long story but my fiance is being charged for promoting and possessing CP. Police raided our home back in March. They went through all the devices in the house, his mom, mine and his brothers. They found nothing other than a P2P software on my fiances phone that they claim was where the illegal material was being downloaded from. They then said they have to leave and take all electronics in the house. They took everything, phones, computers, gaming consoles. A week later they came back and arrested him claiming they found these things on his computer. He pled not guilty and we were able to pay his bail 7 days later. Finally got the funds for a lawyer and it has just been hell. This lawyer seemed okay at first but things got confusing as the evidence location and amount kept changing. After the second court date they offered a plea of 6 months in jail or 6 months of therapy along with 10 years of sex offender probation. We stated to our lawyer that we want to see the evidence list and from what device it was found on as they took over 31 items from the house, most of which weren't even my fiance's. The lawyer said we don't have a right to see it and that it was on whatever phone he claimed was his and that he gave them. Months and months go by, every court date being adjourned and still we had no information. This last court date we were told we need to make a decision on whether to take it to trial or take the plea deal. All we wanted was to see the evidence so we could make an informed decision. My fiance swears he didn't do this, when I was on maternity leave we were trying to download free movies and I'm thinking it's possible these images were from that. Tried to explain this to our lawyer who said it's possible but they need an expert to look at it to confirm that. That was estimated to be around 7K which we did not have after posting bail and paying a 10K retainer fee for this lawyer. It's looking like we're going to have to take this deal. My question is, we have a 10 month old daughter and our lawyer at first stated he was able to live with us and be with his daughter, now his story changed and is saying he must complete some safe guard program that could take months or even a year to show that he is safe to even be around her...he is the most loving, companionate and incredible father to our baby girl. He works from home and I go into work so he is her primary caretaker. She cannot attend daycare due to her not being vaccinated and if what our lawyer is saying is true...I just don't know what to do. Has anyone with children had experience with this? Why would he not be able to see his own daughter? He said even with his mother or myself there he can't see her until he finishes this safe guard thing and they deam him fit to be around her..also anyone have experience with sex offender probation? The deal says 10 years but SORA states tier one no designation is for 20 years? So is it 10 or 20? I asked the managing partner of the firm and he stated he has to follow SORA but then asked our lawyer at the last court date and he said no it's only 10 years...I'm so confused and this seems to be the only place where people who have experienced this give real information...I can't even get it from our lawyer..please any information would be helpful. The stress this has caused is going to kill me and I'm trying to be strong for our little girl.

Basically, he was on an app that let him talk to random people and someone sent him cp to see if he would buy some. (He did not buy anything.) The DA added a dissemination in addition to the charge of receiving despite the fact he didn't send anything. He's been told they're adding it because it was social media and not because of evidence. The DA will not drop the dissemination charge without adding enhancements to the other charges that would push for sentencing to be much harsher and longer, 20+ months instead of 14. If he keeps the charge, I think that makes him register for life instead of 25 years. This feels so dirty and wrong. He had no contact with a minor and passed a polygraph to show he's not violent nor does he have any tendencies that should be concerning.

1gqjmmd,post,Probation and life in TN questions,"I've read a lot about TN is hard for RSOs. I may have no choice as my wife wants to accept a job there (Memphis area / Germantown).  We have no kids and are not planning to have any. So that may help. I will begin 5yrs of probation on one count of csam possession in April. I'm currently on home confinement in OR. Yes I would love to stay in OR but that is not possible.

  
I have my CDL learners permit and will be trying to obtain my OR CDL before I move. We have money for a down payment on a home so dealing with renting will not be an issue.

  
From what I have gathered TN will require us to buy a home that doesn't touch a 1000' property line of schools, parks, etc. That residence will be grandfathered in if anything within the radius changes. So that's good.

  
I will have a marked TN DL which sucks. I will be on a public registry for at least 10 years which sucks. I will be subject to public notification which sucks.

  
But lets say everyone gets over that. I have a house. I have my CDL and will likely be driving CDL-B around town. Dump truck or cement, septic, etc. The biggest issue I see is that - and please tell me if I am wrong - I can never go to a park? I'm not talking like a playground but like a State park or go hiking or fishing? That would seriously suck. Hope there is something I'm not seeing there.

  
What do you guys think? Again; if I'm a childless homeowner with a CDL and a good wife with a secure career, would TN be doable even if I can never hike or fish again?

My husband unfortunately has to register for GSI for 15 years. We had a carnival cruise last Christmas and was denied on the cruise the day before embarkation. So needless to say we have a bit of PTSD and we don't know how to navigate . We traveled a lot and really enjoyed cruising. Our family has a time share in Freeport Bahamas , so I am really hoping this doesn't mean he won't be able to come with us. We may try to plan a trip this coming summer.....he will not be on probation, and will only have to register annually. I read someone talk about MSG cursing , we never been on that cruiseline but if that's a possibility I would love to try but as mentioned I'm just so scared because we got the rug pulled out from under us the day before embarking and it was during Christmas, so it was a really difficult situation for us.

1gqfu46,post,Bonding out SO partner tomorrow ,"I posted twice in this group before. Deleted the first post because I felt like I was being judged, criticized, and interrogated. The second post is still up but I stopped interacting after a couple negative comments hit me hard while I was still in a fragile and vulnerable state. My partner has been in jail over a month on SO charges and I'm bringing him home tomorrow after a bond hearing. I realize this will likely be temporary and there's a very real possibility he could do some hard time. But over the course of this I've realized also that he and I are both sex addicts. I've started going to 12-step meetings for this and reading literature about sex addiction. He and I are going to work on this together during what time we have while he is out on bond, and pray for the best possible outcome. We have a good lawyer and an inexperienced prosecutor. One of his charges is complete and utter BS that he did not do. The other lesser charges, if they are true, we will deal with together. As I stated a month ago, I love him and I'm standing beside him through this. And this arrest is the catalyst for both of us to address some unhealthy behaviors by going to support groups and finding therapy.

I realize sex addiction is a different topic but it's related to his SO charges, and the sex addict group I joined is very unhelpful, unhealthy, and at least I felt some support here in this group.",13,16.0,2024-11-13 15:45:36,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gqfu46/bonding_out_so_partner_tomorrow/

1gq2tyd,post,Moving forward ,"Is anyone here trying to move forward? It’s a long story but basically my husband got caught up in a sting operation, took a plea deal, spent 6 months in a detention center, and is now serving 10 years on probation. Well, I guess it’s 9.5 now since his time in the detention center counted. We met after he was arrested but before his plea deal so I was there for all of that. I visited him almost every weekend in the detention center and stood by his side. However, he just seems like he wants to give up. He was actually doing better in the detention center. He thinks he deserves to die and desperately wants me to move on. It’s so depressing to watch the man I love become a shell of himself, hiding in video games and emotional eating. He has to do therapy as part of his deal, but he hasn’t started yet. He seems to be in the throes of depression. I guess I can’t blame him; this stuff is depressing! I don’t think he should have been caught up in a sting operation, but he made some poor choices and here we are. He can’t seem to admit his part in it and he definitely isn’t finding a way to move forward. I moved to a remote city because his family owns property and had a place for us to live. We got so lucky with that! He has a remote job that pays decently. I was able to get a job close by. I just wish he would face some of this head on instead of burying his head in the sand. He insists that everyone would be better off if he was dead. Every time I try to have a hard conversation, it always comes around to the fact that he thinks I could go and live this fantasy life if he wasn’t around and that he deserves to die. I don’t want him to die, and it feels sort of manipulative that every serious conversation leads to this. I want to plan for a family and look for ways to improve our house and make a life. I just don’t know what to do. I keep hoping maybe therapy, even though it’s court mandated, may help? I’m even open to trying to find a different therapist outside of all this and paying extra for that if it will help change his mindset and help him want to LIVE again instead of just existing. I can only imagine the stress, but like, people can go on and live decent lives, right? And we are so lucky that we didn’t have a struggle with housing or jobs. I know those can be big issues! I don’t know. I’m just so emotionally exhausted and frustrated.

My job has been asking me to relocate for work, an hour away, further from family, and the time has come. I found a new place in a more populated area. I worry about being googled, people seeing the news articles, new neighbors finding out about me. Especially because my new apartment is very close to an elementary school. This has nothing to do with me picking the apartment it just happens to be there. I’d actually rather not have it there because all of the buses and traffic. There’s no law saying I can’t live there. I’m a level 1 in NY so I’m not listed publically. But you wonder what people will say. Other than that, my social life consists of 2 friends and that’s about it. Which is fine with me.

1gokcxq,post,My (28F) younger brother (24M) was arrested for possession of CP. How can my family and I cope?,"Hi everyone. Posting here because truthfully I’m at a loss right now and I don’t know how to navigate this. 

My little brother and I were close growing up. I adored him and always loved playing with him when I could. He has mild autism and was always in special needs classes growing up. As he got older he gained a lot of weight and was classified obese. Because of his lack of social skills and weight I think he’s struggled most of his life to maintain any sort of connection to people. 

My mom passed 6 years ago and was always his primary caretaker. She was the one who always showed him love and affection. After my mom passed my family fell apart. My step dad didn’t want much involvement with us. He moved my younger brother to live with one of my older sisters. The older sister is someone none of us ever got along with. Because of this she cut contact for him to anyone else. Another sister and I were not allowed to talk with our younger brother. 

Fast forward to now - he ran away a couple weeks ago and it made the sister he was living with finally tell me and my other sister what was going on. We were able to find him and get him into a mental health facility. He finally opened up to us about what was going on. 

He was arrested for possession of CP. He knows what he did was wrong. He knows he’s going to jail. It started when someone he played video games with sent him and others in a group chat an image. Then that person kept sending more and more. Eventually he started searching for it on his own. 

In no way am I excusing what he did. He broke the law. He is an offender. And he has a problem. But all I can see when I look at him is my baby brother that’s so desperate for any type of human interaction. 

How do I cope with this? I don’t want him around my future kids, but I don’t want to abandon him either. I don’t want him to die. Has anyone else experienced anything similar? 

And as for jail - what is going to happen to him? It would be just first arrest and is passion of images/ videos only. What type of jail would he go to? Do other inmates care if it’s just possession of pictures or will he still be targeted?

Just served a \~5 year sentence and am still getting used to the world again.

Thankfully my fiancée stuck by me through those 5 years and I've been able to stay with him while I get used to everything again. It's kinda weird because as soon as I got out of prison, basic stuff like trying to decide what to eat suddenly became anxiety-inducing because it's been so long since I've had a genuine choice in what to do or eat. But I'm lucky because my fiancée along with some of my friends from back when I was a sex worker stood by me, so I'm not totally isolated rn.

We texted for a month in that month exchanged nude pictures and I’m assuming she got grounded and her parents went through her phone and our messages then they pressed charges on me

Can I travel ?
If so where can I go to?
I plan in working in refineries, I have connections their that said my record shouldn’t affect to much and I would get paid good so fingers crossed i get in

1gmpbu4,post,Choosing a Relationship with a RSO,"I've been following this sub for a while and I wanted to share why I'm here.

I've been in a long-distance relationship with someone for almost six months, and he is on the registry. I was able to get to know him for about a month before I wanted to make plans to meet in person. He needed to disclose his status to me before we met. I appreciated that he did, and I appreciated that I was able to get to know him as a person before he disclosed. I've gone to visit him twice now, and I'm counting down to our next visit. He's an incredible human being and I'm excited to build a life with him, despite the obstacles. 

My boyfriend took a plea to child molestation charges. His plea was entered almost a year ago. The crime occurred over twenty years ago. He's had no other issues. It's all very complicated, as most things are. I took time to consider it. I even discussed it with a former sex crimes detective that I'm close to. My friend was able to reinforce a few thoughts that I was already having:

Not one of us should ever be reduced to simply the worst thing that we've ever done. It's very likely that someone can do a terrible thing during a terrible time, and never commit that offense again. The registry is a waste of time and money that only offers the illusion of public safety. 

I know that this won't be easy. There's a reason why I haven't told any other friends and family about his registry status. We've already faced a job loss and eviction,  along with a number of very bleak days and depressive slumps. It's difficult for him to see it, but I know that this will not be forever. Adjusting and thriving is possible. Probation will end. The registry may never go away, but it will become easier to navigate in time. 

And no matter what, you are all deserving of compassion and love. ",26,3.0,2024-11-08 18:24:09,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gmpbu4/choosing_a_relationship_with_a_rso/

So had to stay homeless a bit longer. Some time goes by we find a place. Last Halloween ‘23 was told by same deputy clerks I cannot answer my door or have a porch light on to pass out candy. Any violation of either is a failure to register. Some time goes by we move to another county within the same state. Well I went in to register my new truck 3 days before Halloween ‘24 I told the guy in charge of registrants paperwork etc, that I’ll be in compliance for Halloween won’t answer door or have porch light on. He told me that must be their thing because we don’t do that here. He said I can even attend an event go to haunted houses etc.. 
they also told me I can’t work for delivery jobs. But in this county I can. I was working DoorDash while on probation and parole.

I have looked at the rules and tried my best to follow. The short of it is we are a couple with a kid, and we'd like to move to VA, OR, or maybe CO, and I'd like to hear from any RSOs who have moved there or live there.

My husband is a low risk sex offender. He has no felonies/convictions; received Deferred Adjudication. We have a 12 year old daughter who we have full custody of. She is technically my stepdaughter, but we won full custody earlier this year after a long fight. He is able to enter some child safety zones, like schools, for our daughter, and he has no supervision requirements with her. I wouldn't want to mess that up if we move, so any advice from RSOs in these states with kids would be much appreciated. 

He did get 8 years probation, which he is halfway through. We live in Texas. We are wanting to get out and are considering trying to move to Virginia or Oregon, possible Colorado. Does anyone have any experience moving to these states? Or does anyone have links to good info? I have been doing research on my own, and it seems like Oregon is a pretty good pick overall, but it is always comforting/useful to hear from people's personal experiences.

1gl9tb5,post,"Iphone Seized by Feds for five Months Without Charges – Worth Filing for Return?
","Hi Reddit, I’m seeking some advice on a federal investigation situation. Back in May, federal authorities seized my phone and all my electronics at my home during a search, but it’s now been five months, and I still haven’t been charged or heard any updates. I know these investigations can take a while and they have been investigating me since 2021 I believe.



I have a lawyer who’s been helping informally with advice (no official retention yet since they know I can’t afford a federal attorney and that they can recommend me some good public federal attorneys when the target letter comes). The lawyer’s been willing to receive any target letter on my behalf to prevent me from getting blindsided, but they advised against hiring a full-time lawyer just yet since the case is sealed. They’re worried I might get taken advantage of by someone who couldn’t even view the case details anyway which is why they were doing this for me.



The issue is, I need my phone for work, medical stuff, and everyday communication. My informal lawyer recommended that I lay low and don’t poke the bear but it has been five months now and I really need my phone. The phone I have currently isn’t sufficient and I did not have a backup on my iPhone 15 sadly.



Could I or a lawyer file a **Rule 41(g) motion** to request the phone’s return, especially if it’s causing hardship?  It just sucks because I can’t get a new number right now since I have important things linked to my number on that phone. I know that the feds can just clone/image the phone, but as far as the physical phone it is needed as I am still paying it on every month as well.



1. **Is filing a Rule 41(g) motion worth it in situations like this?** Has anyone here had any luck with this when the government has held devices for months without any charges?
2. **What should I expect if I file this motion?** Would filing it at least prompt the feds to justify keeping it, or potentially speed up the return process?
3. **Risks to filing pro se (on my own)** – Since I can’t afford to retain the lawyer full-time, are there specific things I should avoid saying to keep from complicating my situation?",3,27.0,2024-11-06 21:35:02,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gl9tb5/iphone_seized_by_feds_for_five_months_without/

Does the disenfranchisement of felons resonate with many of you as an excessive, continuing punishment for those who have returned to free society? Or does the commission of a felony forfeit that fundamental right.

It does seem odd that a convicted felon can run for president, but a convicted felon cannot vote in a presidential election.

1gjq0xe,post,How did you show remorse or  emotions while serving your time?,"Hi need some opinions from those who have served time. 
My LO is currently serving for receipt of CSAM. I was originally glad to see him engage in counseling even though the counselor was a joke in my opinion. (Majority of their sessions were spent with the counselor comparing my husbands case to other clients and telling him about their reoffending etc.)
He also did a Moral Reconation Therapy program that seemed to have a good impact on him. 
However he’s only apologized a small handful of times or acknowledged his hand in where my kids and I are now mentally, emotionally and physically as we moved several states away to be closer to where my parents moved to, for support while he was gone. 
When I try to share with him my struggles I get a very flat “I’m sorry you are struggling” and “I’ll pray for you” type of response. 
He just transferred to a facility where he is only an hour away. Since being able to visit him a few times I feel like he should have stayed where he was. All I get is a *brief* hug and a peck that barely even connects. He might as well blow me a kiss. 
I’ve also realized that I’m not seeing the kind of emotions from him that I associate with remorse. He refuses to engage in any sort intimate communication in any form whether it’s in an email or on the phone or a letter. He sticks to day to day stuff and an I love you. He claims he doesn’t want to show emotions because he fears that other inmates will use it as ammunition or see it as weakness and harass or hurt him. 
A few weeks ago we got into a disagreement about something I had done, and almost immediately he was like, it’s over, it’s done with there’s nothing to talk about and refused to talk any more about it. 
He’s never been huge on emotions, but he seems EXTRA flat. It’s to the point that I just don’t want to talk to him anymore because he’s so emotionally unavailable. It’s just painful to see and talk to him now. 
Just seems like he’s not being emotionally honest with me, let alone himself. 
It’s so bad that divorce is floating around in my brain daily. I’m thinking very strongly about divorcing him and just double down in my healing since I’m not doing well with my mental health. Focus more on my kids. And when he gets out, let him work on himself and touch base in a few yrs.

The way he talks about his experience so far, is that he’s just hunky dory going about a daily routine with minimal to no stress pushing his cellie around in his wheel chair. 

How do you feel you showed/felt your remorse for your actions? 
Are emotions really that “dangerous” on the inside? ",6,5.0,2024-11-04 21:37:33,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gjq0xe/how_did_you_show_remorse_or_emotions_while/

It's been awhile, but I am beginning to obsess about my sons future to the point of waking up with a panic attack. His case is still in limbo, and will be for awhile. Maybe I am feeding off of his worry about money, his horrible relationship with his bio father, fears of him being homeless etc. His pre-trial is coming up the middle of December. Not sure how this plays into timelines.  I am a planner and once the gavel hits and a judgement is rendered the world will once again be turned upside down and it will be a race against the clock because he will most likely only have days to vacate his apartment, lose his job, etc. I know nothing about the justice system and how everything works. Are there resources available that help people locate housing? What role does a parole officer play in all of this? Is there a social worker that is assigned? The weight of all of this is so heavy. I just want to know that it will be ok and we will get through this. Thank you to everyone who can provide answers.

While I'm away my brother will have my financial power of attorney, so he can make decisions on my behalf.

If my bank or investment institutions close my accounts, does anyone have advice on where to open new accounts? I imagine getting an account as a felon is already difficult. Being in prison won't help either, but having a general plan or at least more knowledge will help a lot. If location matters I'm in NC (in case people recommend local credit unions and such).

I’m so disappointed in him.  He’s been out for less than two weeks and is already doing things that is hurting his mom and threatening to get him sent back to prison (which he kept saying he was scared about).

His behavior is not rational.  Idk if it’s a compulsion or connected to the deprivation of being in prison.

1gf3b29,post,ASCOL email: Janice's Journal: Answers to Questions are Only Stop Gap Measures,"Dear Registrants, Family Members and Supporters -

About a month ago we identified three cases for which we had not yet received an answer.  As of today, we have answers to those questions, however, some of those answers have resulted in more questions.

First, a federal district court in Missouri has issued its decision regarding Halloween signs.  That decision was strong and clear: Halloween signs are unconstitutional.  The court even granted a permanent statewide injunction that in essence prohibits law enforcement in the state of Missouri from enforcing the state law that required the Halloween signs.

While the district court has issued its decision, the Attorney General has filed a notice of appeal in this case.  Fortunately, the district court’s decision will be the law of the land this Halloween.  And it’s possible the Attorney General will abandon its decision to appeal after his election in November.  Only time will tell.

Second, the California Department of Corrections issued regulations regarding treatment for registrants on parole.  The regulations clarify that every registrant on parole must be evaluated every year in order to determine whether additional treatment is required.  The regulations also clarify that if a decision is made that additional treatment is required, then a copy of that written decision must be provided to the registrant.

After these regulations were issued, a few treatment providers have told registrants that they will not change their practices.  For example, it has been reported that one treatment provider stated that they have always had a three-year treatment plan and that all registrants under their care must complete all three years regardless of the registrant’s circumstances.  It has also been reported that another treatment provider boasted that his company makes a lot of money providing treatment to registrants and that there is no way they are going to agree that a registrant no longer needs treatment.  If these statements are correct, additional litigation will be required in the future.

Third, the California Department of Justice has stated that they have created a process by which it will reduce tier assignments for hundreds of registrants convicted of an attempted offense.  That process includes the mailing of letters to those registrants.  Despite this statement, no one has yet reported that they have received such a letter.  That is why a Public Records Act request has been sent to the department asking if any such letters have been sent.  If the answer is no, then additional litigation will be required in the future.

Answers to last month’s questions have arrived, however, those answers are far from complete.  Instead, they are stop gap measures at best.  Please stay tuned for the final answers.

1gexfq5,post,Happy Story,"So as a side gig, i play music and I do DJ events, usually small weddings and charity stuff. Recently, I did a wedding where not only was I an RSO but so were two members of the groom’s party and the actual groom himself! 
To see how happy this guy was to be marrying someone that he met after all his trials and tribulations did my heart good. Turns out the two in his party were folks that he had done time with. Now they’re all out, happy and moving on with life despite all the inconveniences that we deal with. We actually had to move the venue twice to be in compliance with local regulations but in the end, it was a little minor detail compared to how great and happy of a day it was for everyone. I now have three new best friends because of this and we’ve openly discussed how far we’ve all come. 
Hope this can inspire those here that there is life after the darkness, and with time, you too can become a whole new person.

A grad student who is researching the effects that the sex offender registry has on *you* has reached out asking if you’d be willing to fill out information on how it affects you. 

We do not normally allow studies or research projects, however, we feel this one could actually be beneficial for people to understand the effect this has on families. 

I have verified the legitimacy of the study as best I can and believe it to be legitimate. 

The study information is private. It does not ask you for personal information.  You can access it here:

I'm wondering how many people have successfully ended their probation early? How early was yours compared to the full sentence? Do I have a better chance of requesting unsupervised probation 3-4 years in, as opposed to a full termination? Is it even possible for sex offenses?

1ge83bo,post,What to expect going forward. ,"My fiancé was charged with CP earlier this year here in TN. I have chosen to stay by his side. He is currently in county jail. We do not have the money for a lawyer so one was appointed for him. We have a plea hearing next month. He was originally charged with 9 counts of aggravated exploitation of a minor. He was later indicted on more charges of the same and some non aggravated. 

I know this is not going to be an easy road. I know he will be gone for a while. He was chatting with someone he thought was an adult female but happened to be a cop in another state so he also has charges in TX as well. So far the only thing that has been done is a no contact order with my children that live in our home. (Not his kids and yes it’s been confirmed they wasn’t involved) 

I guess my question is what does the rest of my life look like? How long should I expect him to be gone? Will he be able to work when he comes home? Should I purchase a house prior to his release so I don’t have to worry about landlords? I’m sure I have a lot more questions I can’t think of at the moment but these are the things that run through my head on the daily. 

This process has taught us so much already. We have grown closer oddly. Most GFs would run I’m sure but this man is my person! I still plan to marry him even if it’s while he’s behind bars. 

Any advice of the does and don’t to pass on to him while locked up? Anything I can do out here to help his case besides character letters and proof of employment the lawyer asked for?

1gdq80s,post,"Just under two years, got court in around two weeks time. Can't focus on anything else and THAT won't even be the end of it. UK","Like damn, I ain't saying I deserve anything good, but since February last year I've been waiting for this. In a few weeks I'll be in magistrates court and then it's gonna go to Crown Court. One solicitor said that because of it being so close to Christmas, it's likely that the Crown Court trial won't happen until next year. 

Every single day since it happened I've wished I could just be swept into the future where all this is over, no matter the outcome. 

IIOC, worst thing I've ever done, worse thing I'll ever do. What a stupid, stupid, stupid thing to do. Whole life feels like it's in a blender because I found something and got way too curious. There's a part of my brain that's just always on thinking about this. 

I thought the law was confusing, turns out getting a solicitor is confusing; they all want their share but there're so many variables. 

Am I overreacting, underreacting, ""Things'll be ok"", ""I'm doomed"". 

I remember the investigating officer sitting near me in my kitchen talking with me, even being nice to me. Someone being nice to me has never made me feel so damn small, like some rotting animal. He even lied to my family for me, making it seem like a much smaller issue than it was because I didn't want to drag my family through the mess. 

I'm not sure if anyone from the UK would mind chatting with me, helping me 'get it together' before the date. Never had any issues with the law before. Almost wished I had so that I would've been less inclined to screw up in this way. I'll be paying it back anyway once I've done what I need to do. This is so damn harder than I thought it'd be.

What matters now is the choices you make moving forward.

1gcc5b8,post,Update again. ,"So an update. I'm camping. My family is in a shelter about 2 and 1/2 hours away from me. We decided after trying to wait an extra week, and not getting results, I'd drive them there. We figured out who was pestering CPS about us. It WAS people in our church. There were also people advocating for our kids to be removed from my wife at the shelter, and our CPS worker told us that he had to tell the complainant(we don't know who, of course) to stop, it was no longer an issue as they were SAFE and in shelter. And technically now in a state database anyways....he also told my wife that he warned them their credibility as a complaining party was at risk of they persisted. I found that little tidbit interesting.

This past weekend, after I took my family to the shelter, community started to get very nosy and very hostile. 
It doesn't seem to matter that I live down the street less than a block away for almost 3 years and I'm now camping on state land on the other side of a county easment behind my church.... Or that my kids were here just 5 days ago. 

The police suggested I move, but now, knowing what has gone on locally, I understand the angst. There was a sting in the Upper Peninsula run by that Hansen vulture and the police.
 But also, the Marshals are up here looking for a guy too.....so between the local news and heightened LE activity, I'm more noticeable or something.

So I'm camping. No where for me to to go near my family where they are. No one willing to put me or the dog up. I'm considering heading for Detroit if I have to, lay the groundwork to get my family there with me, prepare the way. No one from our old life and church 3 years ago where they are currently has the willingness or resources (or both) to help now.

I've had help from strangers here and on the net elsewhere. And complete strangers in the community. My church congregation is no longer to be trusted. 

After what I have learned, and after too many coincidences, I'm left with people I cannot trust here, but them also being the only support I have. The homeless community in the nearest city is not a safe place for me to be, and the longer I can survive ALONE the better. That was what the lady at the shelter said. 

I'm applying for jobs. I'm trying to get doctor shit figured out. I keep forgetting to take my meds at the same time every day, and some days I forget completely. Plus keeping myself and the dog safe, while doing odd-jobs and survival stuff (like firewood and even a little fishing, cut up a tree, wind break for my fire, etc).

I don't know what else to do. I'm sure there's something I haven't thought of. And all the people that are gonna say ""I told you so"", or ""You finally did the right thing""..... Don't understand why this was hard to do, EVEN on my and my wife's terms. We have been married almost 19 years. Together almost 20. To be told we don't belong togethed by the very people suggesting solutions to ""help"" us is.... Alarming. To find out that these ""helpers"" are taking the time to talk to people you haven't spoke to in years, talking to your old pastor and counselor without your knowledge, etc. 

I'm defending our position. Not attacking the dissenting opinions.... Trying to explain what you cannot see from your perspective. Already, the folks running the shelter have asked if my wife needs marriage or women's services (like women's shelter?) at least 3 times. 
My boys have had things stolen from them. 

We still had to give in to what people wanted  to keep our family together. There's a saying in the military, ""There's a retreat, and there's a withdrawal""..... A withdrawal is supposed to leave you in a defensible position. Maybe even give you a chance to counter attack. Right now..... This whole thing feels like a full on rout. Full retreat. 

If stuff gets really whack and I have to leave the county sooner rather than later, then it's really really going to be a retreat. 

Long read. TLDR, I'm not dead and life is sorta meh. Not great but not the worst..... And I may be in danger. ",8,9.0,2024-10-26 03:29:44,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gcc5b8/update_again/

1gbzjve,post,"Wife, kids…and travel ","It’s tough when married to someone that likes to travel and see the world..but I can’t as freely as she can.
We have always taken roadtrips, plane trips to other States, etc and it’s been great. I’ve never had any issues with my SO status visiting other places within the U.S. 
I can’t travel overseas, take a cruise, etc.
I had a passport but 5 years ago it got revoked when I went with my wife and kids to South America to visit my wife’s family for the holidays and was turned around, even after going to that same country 2 times prior with no issues.
So travel is limited for us RSO’s as most of us know here on this sub-Reddit. 
But as I said, my wife likes to and wants to travel more.
This past spring break she took our 10 year old on a two week trip to Japan. I was against it for a while, but they had a great time and I got over it. Our 5 year old daughter and I stayed behind. 
Now the wife is saying she wants to go on a Disney cruise with our kids. 
I’m not sure what to think of this. 
I can’t go on a cruise, much less a Disney cruise(I was banned from Disney properties a few years ago when we made the mistake of buying yearly passes.)
We live in Florida. 
I’m just not sure how to feel when my wife wants to do all these things, travel here and there and I can’t be part of it. 
I’ve suggested to her we can continue to see our country, the big, beautiful USofA. 
She’s more ambitious than that, wanting to explore other areas and other activities, (which so happens I can’t participate in). 

At times I feel left out. As if I’m still paying for my past mistakes, even in my own home.

1gbv2cs,post,Can I get over the resentment,"Spouse of a RSO serving time 3-15yrs.  Event occurred prior to our relationship, but the other person(minor at the time of the event) continued to live in the home with us after I moved in, at which time she was 18).  I was suspicious of inappropriate behavior between them during that time, and was told there was nothing inappropriate and made to feel like I was being overly jealous.  Fast forward several years.. she filed charges and he was charged with multiple counts of 1st degree felony.  He admitted to having a “consensual relationship” - while she was a minor to me.  He was married to her mom at the time.  Denies any relationship while she lived with us.. but won’t let me see the prosecuting attorney’s report - said she lied about some things to make it look worse and said there were events after she was 18 in the report which he denies (of course because we were together).  So he wasn’t fully transparent and I will never really know the truth.  What he shared with me is becoming increasingly difficult to process … married now for over 12 years and have a child.  I am in Counceling and thankful I have a successful career and am mentally strong most days, so I can maintain our home for the kids.   I just don’t know if I can overcome feeling like I was lied to, like I was duped into moving in with my boyfriend (at the time) and his ex-sorta girlfriend?  Idk how else to describe it but he said it was more like a “relationship” which to me, makes it worse - not a one time lapse in judgement.  I am in a fog.  At first I was fully committed to staying.  Now I struggle with resentment and trust.  This has changed the trajectory of my future and I don’t know if I am willing to tolerate dealing with resentment for the rest of my life… it will perpetuate as we will be limited in our retirement travel and plans in general and the challenges of being a RSO.  
I am successful and independent which may lend to the change in the way I feel about my future.. but the thought of not staying in the marriage to support him makes me feel terribly selfish.  Even though I did nothing wrong…  if he told me of their relationship when I asked years ago I would have left.  Now we have built a life together.  I love him of course but this has broken my heart and trust. 
Sorry for the long rant - I feel like I’m in a effed up movie.  I’m new to Reddit and glad I found this forum.  I don’t expect anyone to fix my life problems but it is just comforting knowing I am not alone.  

I expect him to get paroled in 3 years… plea was dropped to 2nd degree felonies.  Is it awful that I am pretty happy being alone right now?  Can I Iive with his restrictions and my resentment for the rest of my life?  I don’t deserve this- but does it break up my family?

1gbfop2,post,"Anybody ever take/consider jail time over probation, if it was part of your plea?","I won't get into the specifics but my lawyer told me that he struck a deal with the DA. I may have the choice for either 10 years on probation or 12 months at a county facility with no probation (original sentence was somewhere around 4 years state prison). I've been debating which to decide over the past couple of months.
I brought such a financial and emotional struggle onto my family already, and I feel like probation would just burden them even further. I live with my mother, meaning she has to abide by at least SOME of the rules imposed on me (no alcohol, no internet, frequent house visits, etc.). Probation doesn't just affect the convict, but also the people they live with. That's not fair to her; she didn't sign up for this. If I can't find work immediately, who'll pay the court fees and drug tests and therapy? She probably will. I'd rather do my time if it meant she got to keep her life relatively normal. I just want to remove myself from society and everyone who ever knew me. I want to disappear. I'm so ashamed of my actions. 
I'm wondering if anybody else has ever been in a similar situation, where you had the opportunity to take a jail sentence if it meant no probation/parole. My mother is very clingy; she doesn't want me to be incarcerated, but I'm fearful that probation will do more harm than good. I know other inmates don't ""get along"" well with SO's, but I don't care what happens to me at this point. As long as my family and ex-friends resume happy lives.

Not surprising based on the experiences I have read and heard. We already have an attorney we have been working with who is putting together the packet that includes psychological exam, affidavits,etc....

Just reading the letter they were just focused on the charge from almost 20 years ago as the sole reason for intent to deny...like all of these years of doing well mean nothing. Like I said not surprised but still a punch in the gut...being denied even being able to sponsor your wife just because you are on the registry.   
So not looking for any advice per se here....but any success stories would be helpful for the psyche...Haha.. 

We are five years in already to the process...just finished a two week vacation in Germany so we could be together even for a short timeframe....Our 3rd such trip. We are about as truthful as a marriage can get. We are in it for the long haul....hoping it is in the states....but they may force us to look at other places to be together. 

Venting some here....just pissed that the being on the registry has tentacles throughout your life and has nothing to do with public safety.

1gb9ux3,post,Dating a rso,"I've been reading some posts in here and they've been very informative on everything. I'm really struggling lately and I'm not sure what to do. 

My boyfriend, was sent to prison in August 2024. Prior to the conviction we were dating long distance. We've been together for a year and 1/2 - long distance. For about 8 months of that he was on house arrest. So, when I went to visit it was at his parents were he lived. We couldn't go out for obvious reasons. I seen him the month before he went away. I've done my best to be as support and patient throughout the ordeal. 

I didn't get to talk much throughout the first half of him moving around. His parents vaguely kept me in the loop on places he's been. During orientation I heard from him the most. He called me nightly. Until he once again was moved. He's finally at his permanent placement. He stopped calling me every day and would call me at random. Using more days for his parents or when they're not around, he would call me. I'm not mad about him wanting time with his parents. I'm just stuck worrying about him when days pass and I've heard nothing. It's quite exhausting mentally. 

He is currently located closer to me than his parents and we've discussed visitation. I will be driving a bit over 2hrs for the visits. I can't help wondering if I should let go or hold on. I wouldn't leave him entirely because I want him to be safe and successful throughout this transition. He gets out the end of next year. His time isn't that long. It just feels like I'm holding onto a glimmer of hope that might not be realistic. 

I'm at a place in my life were I really just want a life partner. I know in any relationship it's a toss up. People change their minds drastically especially when ""freedom"" is on the table. Life won't be the same for him once he's out because he'll be an rso. I've stated that I'm willing to be there for him and in person, we would figure it out together. He insists on having a job beforehand. Which is understandable logically. But how long should I keep waiting? Being patient? 

It makes me feel selfish..
I'm so torn emotionally and mentally. 
I had no one to talk about any of my worries to during all of this. I kept my promise not to tell anyone details. It wasn't until recently that People found out.",3,10.0,2024-10-24 18:36:17,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gb9ux3/dating_a_rso/

1gadrbu,post,"Traveling and Booked Stay, But Forgot to Check Restrictions—Need Advice.","Before you read on, I want to acknowledge that we should have addressed this issue sooner.

Here’s the situation: A large group of us are traveling to Oklahoma for a week and have rented a sizeable home to accommodate our group. Since it's a larger home, it was more on the expensive side. One person in our party is a sex offender. Depending on the state, residential restrictions can apply to them. Due to the nature of the trip and the stress of planning, we forgot to contact the local sheriff's office about temporary residency restrictions before booking the rental. I'm really quite upset at myself for not doing this beforehand. Now, the rental is non-refundable, and the stress is weighing on everyone.

I reached out to the local county sheriff's office and was informed that particular rental home is not allowed due to local restrictions (near school, park, etc). I was also told that hotels in the area are red zoned and not available to sex offenders. The office suggested we either look for another rental in the vicinity or book hotels in a nearby bigger city. Unfortunately, this area is sparsely populated, which limits our options.

This situation will likely result in significant financial loss since we have already paid for the home rental, and with one less person, it raises the cost for the rest of the group. Additionally, the registered person will need to find separate accommodations 30 minutes away and rent a car to meet with us daily, further increasing everyone's overall expenses. The reason for travel is not a happy one, so it's just adding to the overall stress.

I know we messed up by not checking the restrictions before booking. Any advice or support would be appreciated. Thank you.",0,3.0,2024-10-23 15:45:58,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gadrbu/traveling_and_booked_stay_but_forgot_to_check/

We should have the same fundamental rights protecting workers rights and free from harassment by coworkers and business owners . If a Forman at a construction company makes jokes and rude comments it makes for a toxic workplace environment for an employee who is on the registry I have filed with the eeoc and they say we are not protected from harassment and retaliation because of our registry status which should be changed it gives coworkers and employers the right to treat rso’s with no repercussions it is flawed ,0,18.0,2024-10-23 14:56:27,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gackg6/workplace_discrimination/
1ga9971,post,I'm in love with an accused SO,"I deleted my first post in this group. I didn't want to debate the severity of the charges, or discuss the specific pending charges. My mental health has not been good since my boyfriend was arrested almost 2 weeks ago on SO charges, and I came here just hoping to find support and to feel less alone. I have very few friends I've been able to discuss this with for fear of judgment. I love this man, and these allegations don't change my feelings for him. I choose to stand by his side and support him through this ordeal.

Having said all that, there are three 3rd degree felonies and a 2nd degree felony. He hasn't been formally charged yet. I hired an attorney, and the attorney thinks there are some issues with the case that might work in his favor, and that the F2 is unproveable and likely to be dropped. The bond is unaffordable and I'm hoping the lawyer can get it reduced to a number I can afford. I know when something like this happens, the accused is often abandoned by friends and family, and those who choose to support that person are often judged and shunned for their decision to stay. 

That's basically where I'm at right now. I'm just trying to support him however I can, while trying to manage my own mental health. A couple of friends in whom I thought I could confide have shunned me, but I have found a few more who are sympathetic and supportive.

**Partial 2024 Conference Line-Up**

* No Room at the Home: Sexual Offense Policy & Aging Stephanie Jerstad, Ph.D., Associate Professor, Millersville University of Pennsylvania When criminologist Stephanie Jerstad's former client, a registered 'sex offender' died waiting to find a long-term care facility in Illinois that would accept him, she dedicated her dissertation research to studying if facility-level characteristics matter in explaining organizational policies for the admission of persons on the sex offender registry. This workshop looks at emerging trends around older Pennsylvanians on the registry and what standards and policies should be amended to ensure fair treatment of all. Dr. Jerstad will also discuss changing perceptions around sexual offense policy and law from her purview as Assistant Professor of Sociology and Criminology at Millersville University of Pennsylvania.
* Using the Good Lives Model to Build a Better Life Jennifer Weeks, Ph.D., LPC, CAADC, CSAT-S, CMAT, Founder & Director, Sexual Addiction Treatment Services, Bethlehem, PA & Plymouth Meeting, PA The Good Lives Model for ""offender"" rehabilitation states that if someone who has become dependent on criminal activities (including crimes of a sexual nature) is equipped to live better, pro-social, and personally meaningful lives, their reliance on unhealthy or deviant coping mechanisms will be replaced by acceptable ones. In this workshop, Dr. Jennifer Weeks, a Pennsylvania Sex Offender Assessment Board-Approved treatment provider, will examine the key components of this this strengths-based model. Participants will learn how anyone, even non-offenders, can use the Good Lives Model to build a better, more fulfilling life. Dr. Weeks will also briefly overview how the Good Lives Model supports the Risk-Needs-Responsivity (RNR) model championed by most states' oversight agencies.
* Community and Connections: Using Restorative Circles for Support and Activism Amber Vlangas, Founder & Executive Director, Restorative Action Alliance Participants in this two-part workshop will learn the principles of restorative practice and components of community-building circles. The workshop will provide examples of how restorative peer support circles are utilized to provide support, deepen community, and encourage people to rise to their potential and make their voices heard. If time permits, participants can participate in a circle designed to support people impacted by the registry.
* Rethinking & Reframing Our Stories John W. Dawe, MNA, CNP, RCP, RCPF, PARSOL Managing Director & NARSOL Marketing Director Lisa Kessler-Peters, PARSOL Board Member & National Motivational Speaker Everyone affected by the sex offense registry has a story to tell. This workshop will help everyone frame their story in a way that supports the long-term movement of hearts and minds. Advocates, policymakers, and communications strategists agree that using a tried-and-tested model for storytelling used by other social and political movements is the best approach. At this workshop, participants will learn about the Value-Problem-Solution-Action (VPSA) model, and how PARSOL has successfully used it to speak to policymakers and legislators with increased engagement.

**PLUS Hear Plenaries and Workshops by:**

* State Representative Emily Kinkead, Chair of the PA House Judiciary Committee's Crime and Corrections Subcommittee 
* Pennsylvania's Executive Deputy Attorney General Robert Reed, Chair of the Pennsylvania Reentry Coalition & Expert in Trauma-Informed Justice Reform Policy 
* Brenda V. Jones, NARSOL Executive Director

* Reentry and Reform Panel featuring experts in employment, housing, treatment, and faith communities for registrant-reentrants. 
* PLUS join us for a free post-conference screening of the award-winning documentary UNTOUCHABLE! When the most powerful lobbyist in Florida discovers that the nanny has sexually abused his daughter, he harnesses his extraordinary political power to pass the toughest sex offender laws in the nation. UNTOUCHABLE chronicles his crusade, and its impact on the lives of several of the 800,000 people forced to live under the kinds of laws he has championed. The film interweaves intimate portraits of men and women who have been branded sex offenders with the heartbreaking stories of those who have suffered sexual abuse. It is a film that pushes viewers toward an uncomfortable place, requiring them to walk in the shoes of those who have survived sexual abuse, but to still bear witness to the experiences of those society reviles.",3,0.0,2024-10-23 06:58:37,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1ga4bf7/parsol_conference_nov_15_in_harrisburg_pa_adds/

So pleaded guilty which reduced it to 2years.  I've had 2months to get my affairs in order but I've struggled so much with it. 

Got nobody to help me with this. Still got my car, flat full of furniture and appliances etc..  everyone seems to want stuff for free so struggling to even get a few £££ for items. I refuse to give it away for free!!

Had a pre sentence report and I'm under the impression they will suggest 2yrs suspended sentence/tagging and community service which I'm more than happy to take rather than going to prison.

So that's in the back of my mind, probably why I'm struggling to get rid of things as there's a chance I might go to prison. But still...

I'm sat here crying my eyes out, broken down and so close to screaming fck it and giving up!

Took a box of clothes to my parents today, I've a few more boxes to take in the next few days but the tension when I got there between use was terrible. I don't want to go back and drop ym stuff of there with them!

1g8yuww,post,Regret not going to trial?,"I often read here people regretting their plea deal many years later. At the time you were probably terrified of random people (jurors) sealing your fate, especially after you learned how law enforcement manipulates the truth, suppresses evidence in your favor, and generally runs roughshod on most civil rights in the investigation. The thought this would surely carry through as the prosecutor presented the case to the jury w/ state winesses etc... made you very skeptical of a fair trial.

Most CSAM folks here had little wiggle room due to nature of a computer crime and unambigous evidence against them, but for the others, do you think you could have won at trial if you were not so scared of the process or integrity of the process? I know people in he said/she said cases where the police literally told the witness against them what to say verbatim to a jury, or coerced them to testify with threats when they change their mind or realize they were not being truthful.

I am curious of anyones thoughts. The system seems very slanted against anyone trying to actually defend themselves.",14,35.0,2024-10-21 19:46:38,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1g8yuww/regret_not_going_to_trial/

We're definitely stable, we definitely understand his past and will have room for him and he can stay with us indefinitely. We've already determined that there are no distance restrictions for him in the city we're moving to. 

Has anyone ever been through the process or had a loved one who has? I'm worried for him and also curious how the process works, how long it takes and whether he's going to need a lawyer or what.

1g87q7d,post,Tomorrow I will be sentenced,"I've been on this journey for a bit over 2 years now.

I was arrested in February of 2024 (technically I turned myself in upon suggestion of my lawyer), spent a night in jail, and bonded out the next day.

I had a really good lawyer and we fought vigilantly to get the charge dropped, but there was a Special Prosecutor assigned to my case and he didn't seem to want to budge.

He offered a plea deal of Sexual Assault in the 2nd degree with the suggestion of 5 years of probation (or suspended sentence, still working on this) and, of course, registration as a sex offender.

I live in Arkansas which has a 15 year minimum registration. I am hoping that I get assessed as a level 1 sex offender, but there is no guarantee to this obviously. At least then I wouldn't show up on the map.

I ended up taking the plea deal because I have a wife and children and I did not want to risk getting sentenced since it would be up to 12 random people to decide my fate. I am sure there will be some regret to this later in life, but I genuinely feel its the best I can do with my circumstances.

I wanted to post here and ask if anyone has any experience in Arkansas, and what I can expect life to look like for the next several years. We are distraught and heartbroken that this is where we are at. We might lose our home (our lease states clearly that no registered sex offenders can live here) and after all of the legal fees ($30k and counting), we aren't in the position to buy a home right now. I am working with the Rental Group to see if there is something we can do to stay, and he says he doesn't THINK it should be a problem, but that it has to be passed by their legal department. I am hopeful, but naturally very worried as well.

In terms of work, I own a business that operates all over the world so I am not worried, right now at least, about employment.

I have to break the news to our oldest tomorrow after everything is finalized and I am very worried about this as well.

Any insight is greatly appreciated.

  
EDITED TO ASK:  
Can anyone also inform me of what the assessment is like? How long does it take to get assessed? What does the process look like? Again, I am hoping for Level 1 but there's nothing I can do to ensure this, ultimately.

We have a home if Florida where my wife stays but it’s within a 1,000 ft of a “bus stop”. I would be staying there during the days and returning to the hotels for “sleeping/temporary residency”.

 2. Since I’m no longer a resident of Florida and am not staying any visit over 48 hours, am I still required to update and keep information posted on the Cyber Communication System?

long story short, I recently reconnected with one of the most interesting people I’ve ever met, after not speaking for a few years. We both love nature and have found major healing in our lives because of it. We started talking and hit it off right away, were texting nonstop, etc. He seemed really caring and thoughtful. One night we decided to talk on the phone. Right away he tells me that he’s living in a halfway house and that a few years ago he was arrested while living on the East Coast because he had hooked up with an (extremely) underage girl who snuck into a bar he was at. He was blacked out and doesn’t remember a thing.
Fast forward to when he was living on the east coast- he gets arrested and thinks they were mistaking him for someone else.
3 years later, after being expedited back to LA, he finds out he has a 20 year parole, 10 if he doesn’t violate. 
I live about 2 hours away from him in a different county, and his PO doesn’t allow him to travel right now. This is all becoming so exhausting and the thought of dealing with this for 10-20 more years sounds brutal. I understand it is infinitely more difficult for him, but I’m starting to think I can’t do this for 10 more years. 
We’re in our 30’s.
Anyone have any advice? Is there any chance of him getting off parole earlier than 10 years? He is going to therapy, looking for employment, and has stable housing for now.
Any advice of anecdotes would be appreciated as I’m having a very difficult time weighing whether or not it is worth it to be in this.

1g7mino,post,Went to court but they didn’t have my case,"This is a throwaway account

For background, in 2020, I had an incident with the police. [I was a minor at the time.]I'm assuming it was a citation or ticket. They seized my stuff, the cops made me sign the paperwork and it said I had a court date. When that court date arrives, my mother and I are the court building. We talked to the lady at the front and she said that my name wasn't on file. My mom tried to follow up weeks/days after that and nothing came up.

The years passed, life happens and fast forward, it's 2024. Now I am an adult. 
I have a jury duty date scheduled for next month. It clicked in my head that I had this run in with the law. Now I'm freaking out that when I show up for jury duty, they might tell me I have a warrant or something like that. Since 2020 ive been staying out of trouble and life stuff happened. This is a bit unrelated but my mom has been out of a job the past 2years and has been trying to file for disability for the longest. She suffered from a stroke and has a whole list of medical issues. And I'm her sole provider/caregiver. So now im stressed out about that and this upcoming jury duty situation. 

I wanna know if I have a warrant or what the consequences would be. Because I mean the court failed to follow up on me. 
Should I not stress about this too much?

1g6ypmy,post,Trying to find housing ,"So my husband is considered a sex offender. It isa public indecency/indecent exposure charge. Never touched any kids, never touched anyone. I know this because he showed me a copy of the police report that was made & the court docket as well and is adds up to his charges. (Lewd or lascivious conduct) It happened in the state of Florida, & I guess all sex offenders there have to register for life, so when he moved up here to Ohio with his dad, when he got out of prison, he was placed in the registry (obviously), but they put him in the TIER 3 Section of the sex offenders. He has talked to his dads lawyer, & he said he would be willing to take his case, because after reading the charges, police report & court docket, he said he would be willing to help him get that down & possibly removed from at least being a tier 3, if not removed completely, only issue is he runs out of cuyahoga county, my husband resides in portage county, & he would need to move to cuyahoga county, so that’s where we have been looking mainly. 

The main issue is, we have looked EVERYWHERE, for a place to live. We either don’t get a response back from potential landlords, or they stop responding as soon as we ask if they accept felons(specifically sex offenders). We have been married a year & together  on and off since we were young & we have been living separately, as he’s not allowed to live there, due to the guidelines he has to follow, but his registration officer (he is NOT on parole), said he is allowed to visit for 3 days in a row, he just has to go home every 2-3 days, so it doesn’t mark that he lives there. We have followed that rule so he doesn’t get in trouble.. it’s just becoming so stressful for him and I both . We don’t have enough credit or enough funds to try and buy a house so renting is our only option.. I have tried looking up multiple resources to try and help, but there isn’t any.. I’m not sure what to do.. I’ve tried looking up private landlords as well.. I just want to be able to call a home with my husband and eventually start a family.. but this charge is what is stopping us from that.. I feel like I’m going backwards and not forwards.. does anyone have any suggestions??

I have go register every 90 days but now that I don’t have a job and no place anymore I have to register every 90 days. I had surgery in June on my neck . Quadruple discectomy. Chiropractor adjusted my neck and herniated 4 discs in my neck. Lost all feelings in my hands. So I take fmla and have approved fmla from employer. I try to go back early a few weeks because money is tight not working. Turned in my medical restrictions to HR and I get a reply. Cannot accommodate. Go back to my surgeon and have the lift restrictions raised. Cannot accommodate do not come back. Go back again and surgeon has my lift restrictions at 25 pounds for 12 weeks. I got an email from hr saying they have to have a letter to accommodate at 25 pounds or more but 10 days later received an email that the weight must be 50 pounds for my position. Federally they are required to accommodate a position temporarily which they said they had. They emailed me saying I abandoned my post by not coming back at my scheduled day when they told me not to return. What’s even better is I was denied unemployment and filed an appeal. I got the job June 10 2021 I was released march 3 2021. I’ve only had 2 interviews I feel like employers may be doing bg checks before they even talk to me: I do have a bachelor’s degree and experience in my field that I cannot work in so I’m applying to jobs I have very little work experience.

1g6tqsu,post,Is it normal for your therapist to teach you to be paranoid?,"Back when I was in court-ordered therapy I was told to be constantly vigilant any time I go in public. The therapist wanted us to always have a chauffeur any time we went out in public. He said the chauffeur was there to be an extra witness in case anyone tries to make false accusations. that it's for our own protection. Fore example, he said that if we we need to use a public restroom, the chauffeur should go in first to make sure there are no children in the bathroom, because we can't risk ever being seen near children. 

I was taught to constantly worry about how my actions in public could be misinterpreted or misconstrued by strangers. I was told that if I bump into a child by accident, there's a risk that someone might recognize my face from the registry and raise a panic about it and report me to my probation officer. 

Here's another scenario. You're walking down a the aisle in a grocery store and you see a child alone looking lost. The correct response is to turn around and get away as fast as possible, because you can't risk being seen with a child; it might lead to a false accusation if someone sees a sex offender interacting with a child.

basically I was taught to assume that anyone around my might recognize my face and might report me to my probation officer at the drop of a hat. And these precautions are to protect me.

1g6p4l7,post,"My early termination from probation is being approved, i will no longer need to register!","I’ve posted my story here when i got sentenced a year ago. i received a lot of good lucks and best wishes. i decided to ask my attorney to file an early term motion with the court since i had finished my treatment and reached my halfway point of probation. I went to court and was told i would be getting released. no opposition from the state. 

Long story short i was caught in a sting operation and was given a plea deal that allowed me to reduce my charge to a non-sexual misdemeanor and the ability to be removed from the registry if i complete my probation.

im extremely lucky. so much so that i feel a sense of survivor’s guilt. The registry is unbelievably unfair on people’s lives and ability to make a living. this was the worst mistake i have made in my life. i got a taste of it, the pain, the losing friends, the stigma, the mental health issues. it was the hardest time of my life, im a young man but i was sure that my life was ruined when all of this started. i was lucky to be able to afford an attorney. i was lucky to have my family support me through all of this. im so grateful for everything especially the sub. i completed my therapy, I’ve become a better person, and i am changed. i’ve been attending school, I’ve changed my outlook on life. i was depressed before this all happened and for a while after it happened i was even more depressed. but as time went on, i feel way better and have a new appreciation for everything. i honestly believe this experience, although terrible and painful at times, changed my life for the better. i feel remorse for what i did and wish i never had done it. but i am happy to move on to the next chapter of my life.

this sub was a life saver. i learned so much here and talked to many great people and helped many people as well. The ability to find resources here was helpful, the positive stories were great, the mods do a good job. My heart is with everyone here. 

i have made a post on my profile giving my story for anyone who wants to read it. i hope anyone who stumbles on this post in the future can get some insight and help if they are being charged or going through the same thing. Thanks everyone.

1g681xu,post,Lawsuits - Stings,"My husband has been arrested for communicating with a minor in a sexual manner in the state of California. The thing is I have seen the police report, I have seen the profile he was communicating with and the messages exchanged. The police report leaves out a HUGE detail that makes is seem like he knew the decoy was underage the whole time he was communicating with her but he did not know.

Firstly, we are in an open relationship. I know he was communicating with other adult women online, so please no judgement on that part.

About a month ago he started a conversation with a profile on a very clearly adult website that listed the decoy's age as 24 and had a few pictures of clearly an adult woman. They start exchanging sexual messages that day and the follow day after a few messages are exchanged and she tells him that she's actually 13. He gets totally freaked out and tells her it's not a good idea to be doing this, it's dangerous for her and then blocks her number and profile.

He immediately calls me to tell me about this clearly upset by the situation and later that night he shows me the profile the messages and I see that she is indeed blocked. We talked about it and chalked it up to a troubled child but felt there were really no further steps to be taken. Looking back at it I realized we probably should have at least reported the profile to the website, but hindsight is 20/20.

About 2 weeks ago I wake up to a search warrant and my husband in the back of a police car. They took his electronics and found nothing else of their interest. I have no reason to think anything of concern is on his electronics. I especially think that because his dumb ass gave the detective the pin to his phone in exchange for my number because he doesn't have it memorized. Of course he wouldn't have done that if he had something to hide.

When his attorney finally got the arrest and search warrant affidavit we see that they detectives left out the fact the the profile listed the decoy as an adult and she said nothing about being underage until right before he blocked her.

My question is does anyone know of anyone having success in suing a law enforcement agency for false arrest in similar circumstances? I tried searching by all my efforts just return news reports for arrests from stings.",16,57.0,2024-10-18 02:36:56,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1g681xu/lawsuits_stings/

1g64c67,post,Has anyone dealt with something similar? ,"Ok so my LO gets out on Monday. Today his PO told him he is not allowed to come back to our house. The DOC drew a line around the victims house that he is not allowed to step foot in. Our house is within that circle. This is the first we’re hearing about any of this, 4 days before he gets out.
The issue with the circle, she doesn’t live there anymore. Idk where she lives but I know she moved. 
His lawyers said he should be able to come home in a few months when the appeal goes through. They are confident that the appeal will work, but there’s always a chance it won’t. We just don’t know where he is going to live until then and if we will have to do it all over again when they realize where she actually lives. We live in Washington and he lived in this house before he was convicted if that makes a difference. He is also convicted of two counts of indecent liberties without force and is considered low risk. This all went down when they were 15, he was tried as an adult and convicted at 21. Saying all of this incase it makes a difference in his chances of appealing this. 
I guess I’m just wondering if anyone has dealt with something similar? I’m really not sure what to do or where he is going to live and we only have 4 days to figure it out. On top of it all, I currently have covid and processing all of this with my virus riddled brain is really overwhelming.

Hi everyone. Long time lurker, first time poster. 😅 long story short, house was raided almost 3 years ago. Husband was found to have downloaded a couple of email with CSA files attached. Deleted them but before deleting, other folks in the places he was hanging around made threats of blackmail if he didn't sent them any CSA he might have. So he is now facing 2 charges poss. And 1 charge dist. 
He got a really good lawyer here in Las Vegas. He took a plea deal cas main goal was to avoid jail time. Sentencing is tomorrow and plea deal is either tier 1 or 2 registry, and some amount of time on probation. 
Question is, what are the chances that if he passed his psychosexual evaluation with flying colors, is going to SAA meetings, has been living here at home with us without restrictions, and lawyer was able to prove he was safe during his pretrial bail release and he stayed at home with us....that they will let him continue living with us? I am terrified that they will decide he can't live at home because of our kids. They are 3 kids under the age of 14. He has never done anything to them, assessment was marked ruled out for paraphelias, low-mod risk, etc. The kids are already traumatized from the raid, the jail time, and all of the fear and uncertainty. They just want their mommy and daddy to be together and happy with them. 
Second question is, what does activism look like in Las Vegas? I'm a sociology student looking to get involved in criminal justice and activism regarding prisons, felons, RSOs, and the registry. 
Thanks for everything so far. Just reading this page has helped me calm down a little about what we can expect. ",11,12.0,2024-10-17 04:06:46,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1g5iec5/a_couple_of_questions/

I’m looking for advice and personal experiences about renting an apartment in NYC as a registered sex offender. I know income requirements are standard, but I’m more concerned about how difficult the overall process is in the city.

For those of you who’ve gone through this in NYC, what are some of the biggest challenges you faced? Are there any particularly harsh restrictions imposed by the city or county that I should be aware of? Any tips for navigating the system here would be really appreciated.

1g5ajsn,post,The Financial Aspect of the registry,"An audit into the California Sexually Violent Predator release program was recently performed and shared with the public. The information in it was simply fascinating. 

To be clear the CA SVP CONREP program is for those individuals who are released from a state mental institution following their civil commitment due to having a mental disorder making them an extremely high risk to reoffend (the diagnosis is usually for paraphila). To even be released, it requires a lot of court hearings, evaluations by community supervision and psychologists, and so on. 

Keep in mind this is a very intensive program, the most intensive supervision program there is. 

What did the report share? 

- 4% reoffense rate...shockingly high, right? 

- 11.5 million dollar spent in 2022-2023, which is an increase from 6.6 million in 2018-19. Think about the hundreds of millions spent in the last 20 years. 

- 56 individuals have been in this program since 2003. So we spent hundreds of millions of tax dollars on 56 individuals following their release from a state hospital. So that means 2 people reoffended, and 1 of those reoffenses was a simply Failure to Register. We spent hundreds of millions to track, monitor, supervise 56 extremely high risk individuals where only 1 new offense happened. 

- 18 people had their supervision revoked for violation of supervision terms and they were returned to the state hospital. And, their supervision terms are 10x what standard sex offense probation/parole terms are.

And to be clear, we should work to prevent new offenses entirely, but is this effective and appropriate level use of tax dollars when it couldn't achieve preventing any new offenses.

There are currently almost 1000 people civilly committed in CA as SVPs, so think about the amount of money being spent or will be spent once these individuals when thry reach the release phase, and that doesn't take into account the millions spent on holding them involuntarily for years before that.

My question is, if I were to get a roommate do I need to give their car information to the police station as well? I wouldn’t be using the roommate’s car at all since I have my own. But recently heard about a 80 year old RSO in Georgia arrested for failing to register his wife’s car. So I wonder if the same rules apply to roommates? And do we need to legally let any roommate know about registry status? ",4,11.0,2024-10-16 17:21:52,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1g54twm/renting_a_room/
1g4tk09,post,My partner was arrested and I've been left with my thoughts,"Apologies in advance for the long post. I'm not exactly sure what I'm looking for; advice, personal experience, just a listening ear? I'm trying to understand if this is something I can move past eventually or if it crosses the line. Anyone in my life, and most online search results, will say that being arrested for a sex offense is crossing the line. I know it's not black and white like that so I'm seeking perspective from those who have actually delt with this.

My partner was arrested at the beginning of the year for offenses of the internet and underage nature. He can't make bail so all of our communication has been over jail phone, although he says he's telling me everything i assume there's more detail he doesn't want to share on a recorded line. More detail wouldn't necessarily change my mind or cement my stance though.
I know every person and instance is different and I'm not going to find a magic solution, just trying to get insight. Nothing I'm laying out is attempting to excuse what happened but to try and understand the situation.

We are both depressed alcoholics, although it turns out his trauma is worse than he had told anyone until now. We had been friends for a few years, dating for about 6 months, and had just moved in together. Our drinking and fighting had become a constant at that point and our last fight landed him in the hospital leading to him taking medical leave from work. The week of his offense he was drinking and on pain medication non stop.
Throughout our relationship he showed signs of sexual trauma, obviously more apparent in hindsight. After the arrest he admitted to having been sexually abused for multiple years in his childhood.
I knew he was hypersexual and watched a lot of porn. I didn't have an issue with that. Sometimes I'd watch with him and sometimes I would walk in on it, nothing I saw him watching was sketchy.

He swears he was black out drunk when the offense happened and that he's never done anything like this before or had the urge to. But this is where my thoughts get messy. 
I want to trust him, I don't think this is something he consciously wanted to do. I 100% believe he is going to stay sober after this and that it won't happen again so long as he does. While incarcerated he has been participating in AA and weekly group therapy, reads/ listens to whatever self help/ therapy literature he can find as well as stuff I've been sending him to try and help. Whatever his true intentions were when he got caught, I don't believe he will risk reoffending.

I still have uncertainties though. If he was black out, how does he know it hasn't happened before? We don't know that. I can't actually know if he was black out at all. I want to believe this was a one time, subconscious manifestation of unhealed trauma but that's not something I can prove, just something I have to have faith in.
Crossing the line for me would be someone who is consciously having thoughts of minors, not seeking therapy, and then acting on those thoughts. And I don't think this is that.

There's still time until his sentencing, everything is still up in the air. We know there is a lot of work he'll have to do and we don't plan on trying to live together again until we both have a stable routine. I have full faith that if we maintain sobriety, continue therapy, and just overall put effort into being functional members of society we will have a wonderful, lifelong partnership. But to get to that point I will have to be able to move past this, and I'm not sure if I can or even if I should.

Any comments at all are appreciated, thanks for taking the time to listen.",12,11.0,2024-10-16 07:12:03,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1g4tk09/my_partner_was_arrested_and_ive_been_left_with_my/
1g4star,post,Just found out,"I just found out that the person I've been dating for a couple months is a RSO. He has asked to talk about it and I told him I needed some time to possibly check in with my therapist, but that isn't going to happen any time soon (it's been over a year since I've seen her and need to get back on the schedule). I am feeling the need to get some answers more quickly.

I've been lurking here a couple days, reading all I could find on the statute for his conviction. What types of things should I be looking out for? This is something I honestly never thought I'd ever be confronted with and I am just spinning. 

All I keep thinking about is how much I liked him from the first date. That doesn't happen to me, I often experience anxiety around dating, but I've never felt uncomfortable, he has never been anything but kind and thoughtful, I really really like him. 

My heart wants to give him a chance but realistically, I don't know if I can do this. Any words of support, advice, or things I should be thinking about would be welcome.

And to clarify, no he didn't tell me immediately, and I can't decide if that is a red flag.",24,87.0,2024-10-16 06:17:07,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1g4star/just_found_out/

1g4fgvh,post,Just quit my job and I’m not doing well,"I called both my jobs today to disclose since I have court where I plead on Monday. I work with kids in both jobs, so I know I can’t keep them. 

I’m so sad. I loved both of those jobs but one of them I was a nanny for a family and it’s tearing me apart. The mom was very nice and understanding, she knows where my intentions were and felt bad for my situation, even trying to brainstorm things I can do for work. She did ask if I had done anything to her kids, which absolutely broke my heart. I know she had to ask, I just can’t believe I put her in a position where she did. I’m so heartbroken. I never intended for my clouded judgement to have this effect. 

I’m having a call with the family later today to say goodbye and I can’t stop sobbing. We are telling the kids my second job needs me and that I won’t be able to come over anymore. I just don’t want them to feel abandoned or unloved. They are 9 and 12, such an awkward age to have to do something like this.

1g4fdjo,post,Issues with North Carolina,"So here I am with this throwaway account again.  As the title states, I'm in NC. I was released in May and settled here at a family member's house. I've registered, applied for food stamps and medicaid and was approved.  The issues I'm having are with the LEA I'm registered with.  

Basically, they don't seem to know the law.  I'm registered under the ""substantially similar offense from another state"" clause.  My offense, as translated to NC law, is 14-190.17A. I have to register for 10 years under NC law before I can petition for relief.  The problem I'm having is with the state presence restrictions. That's under 14-208.18.  Initially reading the statute, it looks like it applies to me. But, that little ""See Editor's note for contingent expiration date"" at the top got me to looking at what that meant.  I found out that the paragraph that lists my offense was added long after the statute became law.  Basically, it was amended by session law 115 of the 2021 general session.  At the bottom of that session law, it plainly states that the amendment applies to offenses committed on or after December 1st, 2021.  My offense was in 2018, with conviction in 2019.  I showed this to the deputy who handles registration, who called the county attorney, and the attorney's response over the phone was ""Does he have to register? Then he has to comply with the restrictions.""  

This is coming up right now due to the fact that I'm in the disaster area of NC from Helene, FEMA is set up at the library, and I'm told I can't go to the library because it has a children's section.  I've called an attorney, who told me after looking at the statutes that I'm correct, it doesn't apply to me, but that I'll probably have to file a motion in superior court for declaratory judgement (basically the judge telling the county not to apply the restrictions on me) and that he would charge $3,000 to do that.  Since I'm still unemployed, I can't afford that, and I've gotten no responses from various legal groups I've contacted that offer free legal help or the ACLU, or even NCRSOL.  

I've read responses from people who identified themselves as attorneys.  Can one of those people perhaps give me some assistance?  This issue has actually blocked me from more than one job.",0,6.0,2024-10-15 18:56:39,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1g4fdjo/issues_with_north_carolina/

1g4a4t6,post,Am I not allowed privacy during therapy?,"So during a session with my therapist, he had an “office manager” come in to organize his documents. He claimed the guy doesn’t know much and to not worry about him. As soon as that guy came in, my therapist became very hard to communicate with. He seemed irritated and confused. The session finished roughly and quickly. 

There’s been a few other times when his clients overlap during sessions or just pop in and start talking to him about their issues. Since I have experience working in a very similar field, I am more than positive that these are violations of confidentiality or HIPAA. 

For like a month straight, I didn’t see him in-person despite me arriving on time to our prescheduled appointments. He would tell me later in the day that I should’ve waited or he had some type of trouble getting there. I suggested several times for us to consider a later time to have appointments and it fell on death’s ears, or he said the usual time is good.

Correct me if I’m wrong because I feel like the people I’ve been having to deal with keep treating me like I’m crazy while doing and saying crazy things to me. ",20,21.0,2024-10-15 15:16:22,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1g4a4t6/am_i_not_allowed_privacy_during_therapy/
1g49pr8,post,Make sure and verify that the offense listed on the registry is the same as on your court documents.,"I took it for granted that what was listed on the registry was accurate, because I had been in such a daze of shame and despair during the trial that I didn't pay the attention to the specific statute that I was pleading guilty to, and then I spent almost two decades never thinking to verify it against the court documents.

But I finally did that a few months back, and it turns out that the statute I was convicted of is one digit off from the statute that they put into the computer when I first registered. 

This one digit is a big difference, because it means I don't have lifetime registration after all. Instead, I only need to register for a few more years, and I am eligible to apply for early deregistration immediately.

I have literally never had better news in my life.

Prior to the conviction, I was a nursing student about to graduate. I’m looking to get back into a career involving a bachelor’s degree, masters degree or doctorate. I’ve narrowed down my interests to: Helicopter Aviation (you work alone in a helicopter most times), Cybersecurity (you can and probably will work alone), Chemistry, Engineering, and a couple other fields like Environmental Sciences and Psychological Sciences. I’ve taken a real interest in the Aviation sector working alone. Does anyone here have any success stories of acquiring a degree, what that degree was, and working in what has been a successful career so far? My alternative is getting a degree in anything and moving to a country in Europe that doesn’t require registration/doesn’t have one (looking at Germany) and “starting over” the best I can. 

I’d like to touch briefly on how my job hunt has gone. I work right now for a family member in a garage making wood products every now and then. Work has been slow lately. I’ve applied to several jobs, who hired me instantly then rescinded their offer/fired me 2-3 weeks in the future once they learned about my charge and my SOR status. I was on unemployment for a while but the state hasn’t renewed that for me.

I recently talked about my job struggle with my therapist, and I brought up the fact that I can’t even get a job picking up dog poop for people, so what hope does that give me for finding a job anywhere else? I’m just getting hopeless and want to know if there’s any success stories out there for degree holders.

His plan was to stick to himself and not socialize and this worked in the county jail.  This strategy is less ok at this private prison where he is being held by the USMarshals.  He is big so I am not too concerned for physical safety.  His cell mate has decided he doesn’t like him and is calling him weird.  It may be because my son doesn't leave the cell when he can.  My son described feeling overwhelmed by the social scene- it’s loud and he feels like a like he did when there was a lot happening on the playground when he was little but he has always been able to make friends.  He can’t figure out who has the tablets to use to order commissary, which is good because no one can take his stuff but bad because he can’t make friends by sharing.

1g21r1t,post,State of Florida vacated my registry status ,"So I posted a couple of months ago about pleading no contest to false imprisonment, and battery with no registry. After a couple months of felony probation I applied for an apartment with my wife and the background check showed I was on the sex offender registry. I immediately called my lawyer who told me to call my probation officer who didnt even know I was put on there until she called FDLE. Apparently FDLE decided due to the charges they were going to put me on the registry. I then became homeless and jobless overnight. My lawyer called the state attorneys office and they were surprised that this was happening. Long story short after two months of waiting and a new lawyer the State of Florida vacated my sentence and plea and now I’m only serving 6 months of probation for misdemeanor battery. It feels like a win, and it is but the trama of everything being taken away overnight is still there.

Things continue to go well friends wise and I've especially connected with one person. This person is such a dear friend and told me tonight that they hope they never fail me and I returned the sentiment. I feel closer to this person than ever and I'm getting scared. I don't want to lose such an amazing person as a friend. this person has also told me ""people come and go for various reasons. No reason to miss out on knowing a piece of them."" That hit hard for me. I'm trying to keep that in mind as I continue to know this person but goddamn is it going to hurt when they eventually leave. 

I talked to my psychiatrist about my fears and she told me to tell people (if they find out about my husband) ""this is not my crime and this is not me!"" Well that's all well and good in theory but will it help my case in the event of catastrophe? I guess we'll see. My husband feels bad for me about my plight but there's literally nothing he can do.

I have an up coming consultation with another attorney who says they specialize in sex offenses. Joe Coimbra with Second Chance law firm.

1g1bfea,post,My first experience with an 'emergency evacuation'...,"Without fully doxing myself, my area is dealing with an 'explosive' situation right now.  Initially the radius put my location right on the line at the outer edge of the zone they were ""urgently requesting"" people evacuate from.

The local PD came by after I initially evacuated.  After finding out the evacuation was 'recommended' but not mandatory, I returned back to my apartment.  About an hour later a highway patrol deputy knocked on my door.  He too advised  to evacuate.  I advised him of my status and told him there is no where for me to evacuate to.  He said there was a shelter and resource station set up to help.  I advised, yeah it's in the middle of a park where I'm not allowed to go.  He suggested checking with the Red Cross and Salvation army.  Again, all near schools or daycares where I'm not allowed to go.  And 90% of the hotels near me are in a 'zone' that I'm not allowed to be near.  The two hotels I know are in safe areas I checked and both are already sold out of rooms.

So, I advised him I will be staying put right where I am.  He told me if there is an explosion I could be injured or killed.  I flat out told him then there'd be one less offender for them to worry about.  His only response was ""No problem, sir.  Have a good day.""  Now, I just wait and see if this explosion happens or not.

Also, I'm not the only holdout remaining.

So after seeking advice, I looked in to going to a vocational college. Found one, found a program I liked, and did research to ensure I could find employment. Then I apply, talk to the head of the department and the head of security, they seem to be fine with it but say they’ll have to talk to my PO to find out if I’m legally allowed to go since there were also high schools students that attend classes on campus. Ultimately found out I wouldn’t be allowed to go, which was a real bummer because my crimes were internet based and nothing physical so I thought I had a chance. 

My point is, the consensus is that the trade schools are where you can find salvation career wise. But in my experience they are just as much of a hurdle as everything else. I’m feeling stuck in a low end job that has no security or path upward. Anyone have any suggestions, or work around?

It was obviously reported to police and childrens division, and they both decided not to act bc I was already in the hospital receiving treatment.

I won’t let anything happen ever again, I’ve promised myself that.

Al-Alikhan, who will be tried as an adult, is accused of targeting Brisendine, a registered sex offender, through an online dating app because of his LGBTQ status according to Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy.  
  
On September 24, 2024, Al-Alikhan allegedly went to Brisendine’s home on Minock Street, where he fatally stabbed the victim multiple times before fleeing the scene in Brisendine’s vehicle. Five days later, on September 29, police discovered Brisendine’s body in the living room of his home after being called to the residence. Al-Alikhan was arrested by [u/dearbornpolice](https://www.instagram.com/dearbornpolice/) on October 1 and handed over to Detroit police.

But I’m pretty sure if a plea deal has already been made…that’s what’s to be expected? Help this is all so confusing. 

Update: His family is going to attend the arraignment to speak on his behalf in hopes of the judge releasing him on bond until sentencing.

Do prosecutors and judges fully recognize the full ramifications of putting someone on a registry? How the registry will impact the individual finding a decent job with a living wage and a place to live as to prevent recidivism.  The effects of having to “start all over again” on a registry if the person moves to another state.  I get that it’s a political tool to win elections and stay in power and a cushy job. But are their hands so tied by minimum requirements they won’t look at the individual and try a better solution. Say, no registry if the offender completes specific requirements. If the individual does not comply then they go on a registry. I’m speaking purely from individuals who are no physical contact cases.

1fx99tn,post,Am I wrong to push people away? ,"So a quick backstory, last November I was made aware by an investigation against me. My house was searched and everything blew up. I wasn't charged and haven't as of yet. So we decided we'd tell our friend group what was happening because they had kids and had a right to know. 

Well at the time both my husband and a few of my friends had showed support to keep me up and help me so better. Unfortunately I didn't have much hope and hadn't for a long time and tried taking my life in December. After that a majority of them and my husband took a step back and decided they weren't going to be there anymore. 

I had expected them to leave so I wasn't to shocked. What did shock me was a few close friends that I've kept a divide from decided to help me. I told them the truth. What I'd been doing and what had happened. They didn't push me away, they have been helping me get into the right state of mind so I can rebuild when I can actually get to that point. 

So the actual question, is it bad for me to tell my old friends that I talk to occasionally in small talk that I want complete space from them? I love them like family. The four of us have been friends since we were kids and when I was kid I'd go over when home wasn't so safe. 

So no more random, hey did you hear Linkin Park is back. Hey do you still drive this pickup or even how's things going have you heard from the state yet? Am I wrong for thinking that they are a hinderence to improvement?

1fw83iy,post,Federal Court Grants Permanent Statewide Injunction in Missouri,"Just hit my inbox

A federal district court in Missouri has granted a permanent statewide injunction that prohibits the enforcement of a Halloween sign requirement in that state.  As a result of this injunction registrants in Missouri will not be required to post a sign on their home on Halloween.  

The permanent injunction does not apply, however, to the remaining Halloween restrictions that prohibit registrants from giving candy to children, decorate or their homes or leave on porch lights that day.  Any registrant who violates those prohibitions could be convicted of a misdemeanor offense.

The permanent injunction was issued on October 3 about a year after the lawsuit was filed.  A trial in the case took place in June 2024.

Specifically, the court agreed that the Halloween sign requirement violates both the First Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitutions.  In its decision, the court stated that the government failed to show that the Halloween sign requirement has or will protect public safety.  The court also stated that registrants will suffer irreparable harm this year and every year thereafter on Halloween absent a permanent injunction.

Notices regarding the court order are being sent to more than 50 law enforcement agencies in the state of Missouri to ensure they are aware of that order.  The defendants in this case have the right to appeal the court’s decision to the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals.",13,24.0,2024-10-04 19:50:19,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1fw83iy/federal_court_grants_permanent_statewide/

My LO at age 18 was caught with pictures of his peers on his phone who were minors at the time. The girls pictured were only about 2-3 years age difference and all post pubescent. While I understand that this is an ungodly stupid decision and morally wrong, I feel as if it is extreme over kill for my fiance to have to register because of this. 

He was just sentenced 22 days ago after a FOUR year waiting period. He is located in Alabama. Split sentence of a year in jail and a year of community service followed by 3 years probation. Could be worse but could be better, attorney had as thinking he was going to get the charges dropped for whatever reason so this was a real blow when we heard the final sentencing. 

I live in PA and come 2 years he will be moving up here with me. I need a lowdown of the basics. Is there anything I should help do to prepare for him in the meantime to foster some sort of success? Im worried about housing and jobs as well as day to day life on the registry. Hes a damn good quality fucking guy, extremely book smart and full of lots of life and love. I hate to see this happen to him but I have to do everything in my power to set up a soft place for him to land once he gets out.

1fvietk,post,RSO Charity Ideas,"Hi all, going to keep the background story short. 

In 2015 me and business partner created a startup, it's been an ongoing thing since. We finished one of our last milestones in the development. And we set tentatively for a July 2025 launch. For obvious reasons I'm obfuscating the date and will not mention the name of the product.

Unfortunately my Partner passed last year, sadly he will miss the launch and future. But in his will, he left a large part of his shares to be used for charity. 

One of his big things was plastic in the ocean, already worked out a few partnerships with exising organizations that focus on that effort. The other thing he always hates was homelessness, it was something that always disturbed him.

I'm an ex RSO and felon. I was originally charged in 1998 when I was 18 in Florida. I. 2017 I managed to get removed from the registry. My partner was the person that really pushes me to pruse the removal and if not for him I probably would still be in the Registry.

Instead of giving money to existing homeless charities that exist. I was thinking of creating one in his name, unlike the ocean cleanup I feel like I occasionally could find time and be useful for that endeavor. 

I'll never forget the struggles of housing in the early days of getting released in the early 2000's. I'm months away from really dedicating any time to this, but I was hoping for some ideas of charities that could assist RSO's with housing, also if anyone knows the legalities would be great, like is creating a charity for RSO housing even legal cause for a charity? 

I know people might come up with other ideas for charities and I thank you in advance, but it can only be ocean cleanup or homelessness. My backup is to donate directly to an existing homeless charity in his name.",4,2.0,2024-10-03 21:11:29,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1fvietk/rso_charity_ideas/

1fv3l95,post,Just a Rant and Some Questions,"This is a throwaway account, but might use it for this subreddit exclusively. I'm not going to give too much away since I haven't gone to court yet and working with my attorney, but here is my story and questions going along with it:

I got caught and charged with possession and distribution. For the past several months, my life has been an emotional rollercoaster, depression to optimism to being indifferent and now to depression. Whenever it seems like my life is starting to improve, something happens and drops me back down again. I got too curious and damned myself. There isn't a day where I regret my actions and am remorseful. There are times where I legitimately think I don't deserve happiness and that no one can forgive me for what I've done. Times where I have thoughts of just disappearing, sleeping and never waking up. I'm trying to make an effort to change and redeem myself, but after catching word of what my coworkers thought of me, I just sort of shutdown. It has definitely made it more difficult for me to interact with people and jumpy/paranoid. It just hurts knowing you're trying your best, but no one is going to accept it and still spit on you. I just want to move on with my life and rebuild. I wish I could just magically reverse time and undo my actions or make this all disappear and be given a new, blank slate, but I know that's not how reality works and I need to face the consequences of my own doings. I'm just tired of fighting.

I've been visiting my counselor and chaplain almost on a weekly basis for the past year to vent and confide with them. They have been very supportive of me and its one of the highlights of my week. I still have a few work friends who are still with me despite knowing what's going on. I am exceptionally thankful that they know me well enough to stick by me and know I'm not the type of person who everyone thinks that I am.

My family isn't made aware of this yet and I have no idea how to tell them. I've been intentionally keeping this hidden from them to spare them the guilt and shame of knowing their son is a criminal. I don't want them to get involved when it is my own fault and sin. They had everything banked on me and I just failed them miserably. I've always wanted to make them proud, but my stupid decisions ended up damning myself and them. I've always been distant with my family, but still love them, and it hurts every time when my mother calls me and asks me how I'm doing and that I should move back home after the military, start a family, and I have to sit there and lie to her. I legitimately tear up whenever I talk to her, too ashamed to tell her the truth: her son is a criminal, might end up in prison for god knows how long, be an RSO with no future. I know that one day I will have to eventually come clean, but I don't know how and if I even should.

Edit: After a night of thinking, I've had thoughts of possibly living in my car or a motel when I get back and stopping by my parent's place for dinner/shower/laundry. Would that be allowed? I'm not trying to have a painted target be on them.

I'm sorry if this is just a bunch of garbled text. I'm not trying to look for pity or ""woe is me"". I just wanted to rant and get this off my chest.

For questions:

I'm currently stationed in TX and have TX residency, but am originally from VA. When the time comes, do I register in TX or should I switch back to VA asap and register there when this is done? I'm planning on moving back home to VA after all this is done so that I can be somewhat still close to my family, but far enough away. I'm getting charged federally, so I have no idea how this would all work out, how long I would be on the registry, restrictions, if I can ever get off of it, if the registry carries over, etc.",2,6.0,2024-10-03 09:17:45,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1fv3l95/just_a_rant_and_some_questions/
1fuzj6w,post,Making and keeping friends as the wife of a registered SO,"I used to have close friends. They no longer talk to me but they know about my (then boyfriend) husband and trusted me that I was making the right decision. One chose to end the friendship when I revealed to her my husband's past. It hurt but I couldn't force her to accept him or even understand. 

Fast forward to now and I am getting pretty close to some people and  I'm worried that they will eventually find out about my husband. I'm so scared to tell them. I don't want to lose anyone again. I do have one friend who I've known since 2016 but even she doesn't know. 

I have cried about this to someone on Reddit and all they said was ""you made your bed now lie in it."" I understand where they were coming from but it still really hurt. I love my husband but I need friends too. Is that so wrong? 

I guess my question is what do I do? Do I push them away or do I continue to get closer and risk them finding out? I don't want to keep anything from anyone but I don't want to lose anyone again either.

His offense was 13 years ago but it still was a very serious offense that scarred someone for life. I absolutely understand why some can't accept what he's done.

1furru5,post,Finding confidence to continue ,"Hey everyone, just found this sub so I wanted to chime in with something I was pondering.

For context, it’s been almost 10 years since it happened. I’ve spent nearly all of that time taking steps to be a better person, going to therapy, getting a lot of qualifications and studying for various degrees/diplomas. I’m in a good place mentally and with a strong support network.

Here’s what I’m wondering: I know some of us here are in various stages of their journey, but I’m also sure that sometimes it gets hard to progress. For me, I’ve reached the next decade of life and ready to make a massive change; where it’s getting hard is the stagnation. Having that hope that it’s gonna be okay is awesome, but the other side can’t help but wonder if it’s gonna be when something almost always gets in the way. Call me impatient, but I guess life is just like that. 

I’d love to know what keeps you going? What is that one thing or several things that make life interesting for you to want to go forward. 

It’s been so freeing finding this sub and hearing about all these resources and the wonderful people. Hearing that I’m not alone in wanting a better life means so much. ",5,1.0,2024-10-02 21:35:23,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1furru5/finding_confidence_to_continue/

I, his dad and his lawyers have all told him that no one knows the outcome, but he needs to not reoffend or do anything that would negatively impact his case. My son cannot accept that he will most likely be on a registry. The questions he kept asking the lawyer were redundant and I could tell his lawyer was getting upset because he already told him the answer from a previous question.

1ftvn26,post,"Does III decision, michigan","Here is the release from Michigan ACLU.

Federal Court Rules Once Again That Michigan’s Sex Offenders Registration Act Is Unconstitutional
 ACLU calls on legislature to fix registry law to end constitutional violations. 
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
October 1, 2024  

DETROIT – In the latest in a long string of judicial decisions holding Michigan’s Sex Offenders Registration Act (SORA) unconstitutional, U.S. District Judge Mark A. Goldsmith struck down significant portions of the law in a decision released late last week. The court’s decision in the class action lawsuit, Does III v. Whitmer, will affect tens of thousands of people and follows two recent rulings by the Michigan Supreme Court, as well as numerous federal court decisions dating back to 2013, finding constitutional problems with Michigan’s registry. 
In a 115-page opinion the court upheld some aspects of the registry, but – as in the prior decisions – again found multiple constitutional violations including: 
The registration of people who did not commit sex offenses; 
The retroactive extension of registration terms to life; 
Harsher treatment of people with non-Michigan convictions; and 
Violations of registrants’ First Amendment rights.
“This decision once again shows that Michigan’s sex offender registry is not only bloated, costly, and ineffective, but does not hold up to constitutional scrutiny and must be overhauled by state lawmakers,” said Miriam Aukerman, ACLU of Michigan senior staff attorney, who has been leading the ACLU’s registry litigation for more than a decade.  “Michiganders and their families deserve a system that works by prioritizing public safety and prevention, not a failed, counter-productive approach that makes all of us less safe because it sabotages the ability of people with past convictions to find housing, employment and family support, which are key to successful reentry.” 
The class action lawsuit brought eleven constitutional challenges on behalf of the more than 45,000 people on Michigan’s registry.
The court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs on six claims, including rulings that:
Retroactively extending registration terms from 25 years to life violates the Constitution.
In-person reporting requirements imposed in 2011 cannot be applied to pre-2011 registrants.
People who were not convicted of a sexual offense cannot be subjected to SORA without a judicial hearing.
Michigan cannot impose harsher registration requirements on people with out-of-state convictions than on people with Michigan convictions. Such individuals must receive a judicial hearing to determine their registration requirements.
SORA’s requirements to report internet identifiers like email and social media accounts violate registrants’ First Amendment rights.
Forcing registrants to attest that they understand SORA, even if they do not, is unconstitutional compelled speech.
Under the court’s decision:
About 17,000 people will be removed after they complete 25 years on the registry without another registrable offense.
More than 3,000 people with out-of-state convictions will be entitled to a judicial determination of their registration requirements.
A judicial hearing will be required if the state seeks to keep about 300 people on the registry based on convictions for non-sex offenses.
The in-person reporting requirements will change for about 31,000 people and the internet reporting requirements will change for about 14,000 people.
The court ruled against the plaintiffs on three claims involving individualized review, opportunities to petition for removal, and reporting requirements. The court also found that one claim was moot, and another might require additional briefing. 
Under SORA, the vast majority of Michigan registrants must register for life without any opportunity for a judge to consider whether registration is appropriate. Experts in the case explained that lifetime registration serves no purpose because recidivism rates go down dramatically the longer a person lives offense-free in the community. 
People who have had to register for life without any individualized review include many of the plaintiffs in the case, including:
A man who had a relationship with a 15-year-old girl, who had used a fake ID to get into an over-18 club where they met. They are now married and have three children.
A woman, who as a 19-year-old homeless and addicted teen, had sex with a 14-year-old boy. She went on to overcome her addiction, earned a master’s in counseling, became the clinical director of a drug treatment facility, and now has a private clinical practice.
A disabled man, born with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, who has the developmental age of a 9- or 10-year-old. He was convicted three decades ago of sexually touching his nephew, who is now an adult and supports his uncle’s removal from the registry.
“After more than a decade of litigation and court decision after court decision finding SORA unconstitutional, it is time to focus our reform efforts on what works, not cling to an unconstitutional system that doesn’t,” added Aukerman. “Our goal must be to end sexual offending. And if we want to achieve that goal, we need to invest in prevention, support survivors and ensure that people with past convictions can reenter society successfully.”
In 2018-2019, a work group of stakeholders—which included prosecutors, the Michigan State Police, and advocates for survivors—met for about 18 months to develop legislation to address the constitutional flaws with SORA identified by courts and revise the law to reflect evidence-based practices. The group looked at shorter registration terms, individual review, paths off the registry for rehabilitated people, reduction in the number of registrable offenses, simplification of reporting, ending registration of children, and provisions for people with disabilities. Instead of adopting those proposals, in 2020 the legislature passed a law that largely mirrored the prior unconstitutional law. Friday’s decision held that the revised 2020 law is likewise unconstitutional in multiple ways. 
In addition to attorneys from the ACLU, the plaintiffs are represented by retired University of Michigan law professor Paul Reingold and the law firm of Loevy & Loevy.

I often isolate myself from my family it doesn't help that I don't have a drivers license and so I just rot in my room waiting for my mistakes to catch up to me, my room is a mess all i do is play video games drink alcohol and smoke weed, I'm sad I hurt my family in this way and that they'll have to either deal with my BS or abandon me, I'm dreading the day I'm dragged out into police custody, the only person who knows of my disgusting crimes is my grandma who seems to be supportive and thinks I wont be charged as that would be my first offense but I don't think that's the way the world works from what I read is I'll be arrested I'll be convicted and arrested maybe a year from now or sooner, i will have to life the rest of my days as a offender or atleast hopefully 10-20 years which is still a long time, I don't think I can survive being an offender in prison so that's a growing fear.

 I did reach out to a cp legal attorney who did give my mind some sort of ease and i have been saving $60000CAD up for my own car but i doubt thatll get me through this ordeal, i fear the fallout that my family will have when they find out and I fear I'll lose my only 3 friends to this who even without being told have been important to my mental health just by having normal conversations I fear I'll lose this and I even fear losing my internet privileges and not being able to talk to them again and even having to live without internet access, I fear when I'm in prison my only family I'll have left is my grandma who I fear can leave me by passing away I'll like to say my porn addiction has been noose around my neck and I like to imagine I'm not a threat to the public but I'm not counting on it so far I've been thinking of writing a will and putting my grandma on and asking her to give it to my siblings when they come of age but I don't think I have the strength to ask. 

I indulged dark fantasies and went searching and searching for more and more heinous shit I gotta say I'm not proud I wish I can undo it but I downloaded some bad shit and even was caught distributing it on discord and I'll have to live with it I don't know if I can handle telling my whole family this but I feel it will have to come as I feel they will be investigated because we share the same phone provider which I would never wish for them to take the blame or even be blamed for my mistakes I resent myself for everything and I know they will too so I'd rather them not even be apart of this

I ruined my life and I just got a pension from my Job that was close (walking distance) and wasn't demanding all I feel like doing is self destructive things like hurting myself or even pushing family away or making them hate me so they will want to abandon me, my biggest hope in this world for any sort of mercy for my actions is being killed by a bear or hit by a car when I'm on my way to work nightshift so that maybe in memory I can still be remembered fondly but to be honest I want to live  I want to get through this I want my family to love me and one day i would like to find love but i dont know how the dating world is for gay sex offenders so my world seems dead in the water but for now it all seems to be crumbling and im waiting for it all to fall
 
I don't know if I'll keep this up or if I even should've spewed my guts like this but I feel like I'm alone and that's how I'll end up and this sub seems to be the place for scum like me and I did jump around typing this so sorry if it's convoluted",22,30.0,2024-10-01 16:24:21,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1fts7n0/calm_before_the_storm_probably_have_to_delete/

This is so frustrating and I don’t know what to do. If if we’re both sex offenders then what are they gonna do if he has a medical emergency or even these routine procedures there’s nobody else in our family that could do it literally nobody he’s an orphan. I’m practically an orphan. Our closest relative is an 86-year-old grandma who barely drives, so if anybody has any advice, please please please share it.

I’m eager to leave Washington, but my past is holding me back. In 2009, I was charged with communicating with a minor for immoral purposes through electronic text messaging, which was classified as a gross misdemeanor. I was designated as a level two sex offender. I have since completed my probation and treatment, and I am no longer required to register. However, if I move to another state, I would have to register again and start the process all over, which is not something I want to do.

1fsymgo,post,Job hunt,"Issue: I got an email saying prospective employer wouldn’t be going forward with me because of background.  I called them and may have turned it around.  The backstory and what I said today:

Backstory:
Offense and arrest in 2008. Conviction 2010.  Probation 2010-2015. Registry: 2010-2020. Moral panic with new news articles: 2018. Pardon & expungement: 2021.  Employment with prior employer: 2012 to Sept 2024. 

I was in a leadership position at my most recent employer— but it was becoming a less than ideal environment — and although I left on good terms, I left. Although I need the income, I wasn’t willing to risk my mental health. So — I’m back in the job market. 

I’ve applied for a number of jobs. There are things I’m good at (financial analysis/ Excel), I have great organizational skills and there are things I’m passionate about (criminal justice reform and helping people heal). I’m looking at both. 

So, I found a role that would fits into “things I’m good at” category.  I had two rounds of interviews— mid size business and I’d be reporting directly to the boss. Lots of analysis opportunities— and would be a place I could contribute and grow. 

The first interview was over Zoom. The second was in person. Both were with the person who had been doing the job on an interim basis.  The interviews were good. I felt good about the organization and the role.  They invited me for an interview tomorrow with the man I’d be reporting to. I was excited. 

Today, I got an email saying that the interview has been canceled because of my background. 

What should I do?  I called my wife for moral support and said I would call the man who interviewed me. 

So—I made the call. I started by asking “what happened?”

He said they do their own preliminary background checks (i.e. Google) and since I wouldn’t pass a background check, they weren’t moving forward with me. 

I said— “actually, I would pass a background check.”  I went on to explain that I had gone before the Connecticut Board of Pardons and Parole and had been granted a pardon and expungement.  I explained that the bar was high and I passed it. We continued talking.  I stressed how much I liked what he told me about the job.  I said I certainly regret what I did in 2008, but that was a long time ago and I dealt with the issues long ago. 

He said the role is a “trust” role and that the boss would have to be able to trust whoever is in the role.  I stressed that I just came from a trust role where I had the founder’s social security number and the numbers of everyone in his family. I’m a highly trustworthy individual. 

Then he brought up harassment issues. I told him that although I don’t have it on my resume, I do volunteer work in harm reduction.  I told him I’ve worked with people who have harmed and been harmed. 

I also told him that I have tremendous references. 

End result: he’s going to talk with the boss and see if the boss would like to interview me. 

I said thank you and that I appreciated it. I also said, I understand if they don’t want to move forward, but I wanted to make sure they had all the information. 

I can’t change the past, but I can sure try to influence the future. 

We’ll see if this one works out. In the meantime, I have other wheels in motion. 

Wherever I land and whatever I do, I’ll make the most of it.  But I’m done being silent. 
 
Even without the pardon/expungement, I still would have made the argument that it was a long time ago.

But the thing is, he is on the sex offender registry from a prior, obviously unrelated offense. The sentence and probation from that offense is completed as of several years ago. 

I guess I’m afraid that they will use the prior sex offense as an opportunity to throw the book at him for the DUI, because it speaks negatively about his character. Does anyone know anything about this kind of situation: whether DUI sentencing is tougher if there is a past history of a sex crime?

1frj3js,post,Read the Rules ,"We have quite a lot of new people in the group. We also have a lot of rules. We have to have these rules in order to occupy this space. Please read the rules. All of them. Thoroughly.  

There are two stickied posts at the top of the group. Read them. They will explain every single thing you need to know in order to follow and understand the rules. 

People screw up, we get that. We wrote the rules and sometimes screw up and break one (for me it’s usually cursing.) we don’t expect everyone to be perfect all the time but we do expect you to at least read them and try to follow them.  

If you broke a rule by using words  we don’t allow, we’ll let you correct it. A simple, “hey, sorry about that, I changed the wording of you’ll reinstate it,” is a good way to make that happen. We don’t like removing posts over a technicality, especially when 90% of it was really good information, but we have to. 

Every single rule of this sub is there for a very good reason, whether you agree with it or not is irrelevant. They’re there.  They have to be there. 

Every now and then there are posts that we never thought to make a rule about but know that they’re going to create a problem. We have a rule for that too, it states that we can remove a post for any reason. If we know it’s going to turn in to a sh*tshow and cause problems, we’re taking it down. If a post turns in to a sh*tshow we’re locking it or taking it down. 

If we remove your post or comment and you’re unsure as to why, read the stickied posts. If you still don’t understand why they were removed then you’re welcome to ask. 

You are not, however, welcome to be rude, condescending, or nasty to us for doing it. Doing so will result in a ban. We don’t get paid for this. It’s very mentally taxing to mod this sub. We deal with a whole lot of trolls being terrible to us, we won’t deal with users doing it too. 

We don’t want to ban you, we don’t want to spend our time removing things, we just want you to follow the rules and not be an AH about it when we enforce them. 

So, read them and follow them, please. ",56,4.0,2024-09-28 17:12:50,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1frj3js/read_the_rules/

1fqvm66,post,Need to move on with my life,"I don’t know if it’s an epiphany or what but I was driving to work today and Candlebox - Far Behind came on and that lead me to remember a post by a victim of SA. They had mentioned they did NOT want to hear from their perpetrator. They moved on with their life. The impact still exists for them no doubt but they moved on and made a new life, is my point.

For me during my 5 year parole I had 1-1 sessions and I kept telling the clinician that when I was first locked up I had vivid dreams of my victim and family telling them I’m sorry and just loud screams. I don’t know how to explain it but in general it was the same nightmare for years. I told them I stopped having the nightmare eventually but still think of them all the time. The what ifs and where are they at in life and such. That’s why the Candlebox song was triggering these memories for me as the song is about a loss of love.

So my epiphany was I need to move on. I need to focus on myself to get better. In these past 15 years I seem to have held onto my past in some form and haven’t moved on. Yeah I say it’s because of the registry and it’s been impacts on my life. But other than not getting back to a salaried job and of course loss of time, I have not been impacted like others I read about. I would have hoped that the clinician would have said this to me years ago. But maybe I wouldn’t have heard them at that time?

1fq5zdz,post,Quick Update,"Here's what's going on with me if you haven't seen yet:

https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1foezhr/my_situation/

Today was supposed to be the plea hearing but my attorney granted a 30-day extension on it because he needs more time to look at the evidence.

I did get to meet with him for the first time and he did seem very knowledgable and friendly, and he seems fairly confident that due to this being my first offense (I've never even gotten a speeding ticket in my life) and also due to the fact that I financially and physically support my elderly mother, I could just end up with probation. I asked him if that fact makes the chances of probation high and he said, ""Higher."" 

He also explained that in cases like these they like to make it sound worse than it actually is. So basically they could see a picture of a female in a bathing suit and count that, and another thing that makes it tricky is that because my dad and I shared the same IP address, some of the images found on my hard drive could have been his (he gave me a count of how much was found on my hard drive and there's absolutely no way I had as many as they're claiming).

My Pastor was also there and explained to the attorney that I attend church often and am also involved in his faith-based 12-step recovery program, and him and my mom seem to feel more confident about probation but I'm still scared to death of having to serve any prison time, a good part of that is because I don't want my mom to be by herself.

So, yeah, that's where it stands as of now.

EDIT: Forgot to mention this but the attorney also seemed somewhat surprised that the warrant was issued back in 2021 and couldn't figure that out either. He said he's going to look into that as well.",14,8.0,2024-09-26 20:23:43,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1fq5zdz/quick_update/
1fq4ma6,post,"⚠ Hurricane Helene: Stop discrimination against registrants in emergency situations! Registrants could be arrested for going to emergency shelters in schools, etc.","Even before Hurricane Helene entered the Gulf of Mexico, plans for emergency sheltering for those fleeing flood areas were well underway, the plans of both those assuring that the shelters were up and running and those who would be doing the fleeing.

With time now measured in hours rather than days, preparations have become more focused. Imagine the uneasiness, even fear that would be felt by those involved, the questions they would have, and the concerns for family members and young children.

Imagine that time, fear, and stress being doubled, tripled, or quadrupled in families with a member listed on a state sexual offender registry. What would happen? Would the family be separated or turned away if they were determined to stay together?

**When safety is threatened, when families are driven from their homes, they need to be allowed emergency shelter just like every other citizen, and they need to be allowed to stay together as families.**

People who live registered on a sexual offender registry are ostracized, separated, and discriminated against in much of their lives. Facing emergency situations that threaten their homes, their lives, and the safety of their families must not be one of those times.

He didn’t really let me tell my story. He’s charging me a flat fee of $15k. I asked him to be with me for my arraignment and he sent an intern. I know that there’s not much to do during this hearing but still. Additionally, i asked if we should meet before my preliminary hearing next week and he said that won’t be necessary.

1fpgdk5,post,BF was taken to jail for a parole violation today,"Today I drove my boyfriend to parole for his monthly visit and after waiting over an hour I see them escorting him out in handcuffs. 

Background: he was convicted in May (lowest level, not actually on the public registry but parole supervision for life) 
I have 2 kids (from previous relationship) and I’m 5 months pregnant with our first child. Parole is aware of all of this. He does weekly therapy and shortly after his conviction I had to do an interview/evaluation with him and the therapist so that we could get the ‘living with children’ order in place. Turns out in order to have the therapist actually write and submit that report we needed to pay 1500. Unfortunately he dragged his feet and didn’t pay it right away. 

Fast forward to today when he goes into parole, they take a look through his phone and see a picture text of my daughter that he sent to me when they went out fishing in the pond near our house. I wasn’t physically present with them and that’s why they violated him. Apparently in the rules of his supervision he isn’t allowed any unsupervised contact with minors. I immediately contacted his lawyer and told them what happened. 

I’m so upset, it’s not like we were hiding anything from parole, they knew I had children and that my boyfriend was around them daily. His PO is also aware that his therapist would be submitting the living with children order any day now. 

There’s no bail/bond. I have no clue what’s going on and haven’t been able to speak to him since he was detained. From what I understand he has to have a parole hearing, go through a whole investigation where his PO submits evidence for this violation and then at some point it will be decided if he is released or parole revoked??

You guys this is crazy all he did was be a good dad and took my daughter out for a walk to the pond so my pregnant butt could stay off my feet back at the house. I can’t believe this is happening.

1fpc6cx,post,Travel to Honduras - question,"I have, quite literally, called every phone number in every state that has a Honduras Consulate, and none of them work. Emailed, with no response.

Background: Registered in California 2000-2019, released from my duty to register in 2020 after moving to Nevada, have NOT been on the Registry since 2020. Not listed in national, California, or Nevada. 24 year old gross misdemeanor, solicitation of a minor. (I am NOT a felon), Person said they were 18, when i was 24, and I didn't verify their claim, and they even said this to several other people I know at the time. Anywhoo... 32 days in county, no arrest record, not listed on NCIC, no FBI number, time served, 3 years probation (honorably discharged), SO counseling (deemed not a threat to society).

Question: Has anyone traveled to Honduras, who is NOT on the registry, and NOT required to report their travel plans and NOT required to have the stamp. I can ONLY find information on Registered Offenders. Has anyone any information on this????? Should I be okay, I'd hate to travel for 2 days in the middle of the ocean and be like oh oops can't go here.

In addition here's some stuff I did find out: 1) Mexican consulate states - not on registry, not required to have indicator, not required to transmit travel plans - won't be denied entry. 2) Princess Cruises - will not deny embarkation as long as you're not on the registry 3) Angel Watch (DHS) - not required to have marker if not required to register in ANY US Jurisdiction.

UPDATE: From the Honduran Embassy, because i could not find a a SINGLE working phone number for the consulate.  1) Not on registry, 2) no identifier on passport 3) not on national registry, 4 ) not a felon = good to go. Which was the same response I got from Princess, and also, called Royal Carribean and got the same answer as well as from the Mexican Consulate.

1fp5ju1,post,Federal distribution charge. Florida. Out on bond. Please help us understand what to expect.,"Good morning all. First, let me say we are very thankful we found this forum. While we have not yet contributed much (that will likely change), we feel very fortunate that such a supportive group exists. Kudos to the mods for fostering such a non-judgmental and inclusive environment, and to the community for keeping it (mostly) civil and helpful.

A little intro: this is a shared account for my wife and I to use as we go through this journey together. I could not be more thankful that she has chosen to stick with me through this. I do not deserve her, and she does not deserve to be in this position. I am very lucky in that regard. We are also very lucky that our family and most friends, with very few exceptions, have been supportive and loving. We will both probably ask questions here, and we will both probably participate in discussions. 

I'm currently out on bond awaiting trial on one federal count of distribution of CP. I was arrested and charged earlier this year, spent 8 days in county jail, released with tons of conditions (curfew, internet, treatment, ankle monitor, etc.), and have retained an incredibly expensive attorney. 

Initial questions for the group include:

* What to expect in the event of a conviction and/or plea? Upon entering a plea to a potentially lesser charge, am I likely to be taken into custody, or will that be at sentencing or even a later self-surrender date?
* What to expect when taken into custody? Where will I likely be sent first? Where will I likely be sent ultimately? 
* How will my wife and family be able to find out where I am and when?
* How does it work upon release? What if my wife moves from Florida while I'm away and starts a new life somewhere else? Is it possible they'd release me to where she is at that time?

For context, if it helps anyone to answer any of the above, I am mid-forties, married about 12 years, no kids, financially stable, mostly clean history (DUI adjudication withheld 22+ years ago, handgun in airport adjudication withheld 2015).

The police who raided me pushed for an unsecured bond since i cooperated with them and was polite and remorseful. The judge considered me as a threat to the public safety and set me on a monetary bond, which my mom was able to make. I spend the day in county jail and it was scary as fuck. I was held in a small holding cell with about 12 guys for about 10 hours. People kept asking what i was in for and i just kept saying i didn’t want to talk about it. I don’t know if i can handle hard time. 

My preliminary hearing is next week and I’ll plead not guilty, but i have a feeling I’ll have to serve time. It’s hard for me to stay positive and make it through this.

1fok576,post,Life with a SO?,"I recently found out my partner is a registered sex offender in Maryland. He has explained his charges and I am able to work through the harm he caused when he was in active addiction. He is now 2 years sober, in therapy, and actively becoming a better person. People deserve a second chance. 

The registry is where I’m really struggling…. He can go after a PBJ (probation before judgement) in a couple years (but that’s not guaranteed). Do people know the likelihood of being granted a PBJ??? If he’s on the registry for 25 years, what does that mean for me and our future? Will he need special permission to pick up our kids from school? Will we live in fear of being outed? What will I tell my friends and family? 

Any advice on navigating probation, life on the registry, being a partner of a SO is welcomed. Thanks in advance !

1fohoiw,post,Approved Supervisor meeting coming up,"Hi everyone! 
   So my boyfriend and I finally have a date to meet with his PO, the PO supervisor and the person from the Victims Advocate office so that I can become his Approved Supervisor. This will mean we can go to places and events that he would not usually be allowed to go to. 

I already had a meeting on my own with the Victims Advocate as a screening and she told me that they would be asking me pretty much the same kinds of questions and I would have the opportunity to ask questions of my own. 

Here's a question for everyone (and yes I plan on asking this during the meeting) but what is the definition of ""Contact with Minors"". 

My boyfriend doesn't have kids, he doesn't have friends who have kids and I don't have kids so he's never around kids. But I can't seem to find a clear definition for ""Contact"". 

I mean clearly contact would include talking to a minor but what if someones kid came up to him and was like ""hi"" and he just walked away without talking....is that contact? What about just being in the presence of a minor...like in the line at the grocery store?? 

It just seems a little vague and since I will be responsible for reporting ""contact"" if he doesn't report it I figured this would be a good first step to get some examples.

1foezhr,post,My Situation,"So, I stumbled on this community yesterday and have been seeing how supportive and helpful most people have been on here so, I thought I'd give it a shot and share my story, as I haven't really seen any on here like it, and see what kind of thoughts/feedback I get as to what to expect going forward.

In December 2020 my house was raided, the majority of our electronics seized, etc, and they told us what it was for. My dad had admitted to it which my mom and I were shocked by, we had no idea. Her and I would always go out to the movies or go out to eat or something fairly often and he would always stay behind so our best guess was he was doing it when we weren't around. Anywho, I was questioned as well and I told the officers that I too had seen some images on Google (that's where I looked up all my p--n because I figured it was safe to do it there) where the people may not have looked of age but I kept digging myself even deeper in it because, again, Google, I thought it was safe. Of course, I knew at the very least it was morally wrong and downright evil but I just couldn't stop myself. They let me go and I eventually at least got my cell phone back and nothing else had come of it...until last month.

A couple of officers showed up at my job and spoke with me in a private room, asked me some questions, etc. Eventually they let me know that I was being arrested because they did find CP on my computer. I was shocked as I certainly don't recall downloading anything I had looked at but I guess if you just look at it then it counts as possession. Anyway, I was arrested, booked, fingerprinted, all that, and in just one day, I had lost so much I had gained over the past four years. I lost my job, a lot of friendships, I was a part of multiple online fan communities (mostly anime stuff) and was kicked out of all of them, my boyfriend broke up with me but before he did I asked him to just let one community I was really in close with know that my past was catching up to me and I wouldn't be around for a long time. Instead he posted on a public server where thousands of people were that ""(My name) is a fraud and isn't who he says he was. He's been looking up CP and is a p*do"" and all of this...I noticed this after my mom had bailed me out btw. All of this happened in just a few short hours, my whole world just collapsed. I haven't heard from him or any friends I had made online in the last 4 years since, though I do have friends who I've known for way longer who are sticking around.

Some important things to note though: When I was looking at this stuff, it was probably as far back as 2014, at least that I can recall, because I would look at it when no one else was home. I got a full time job at the end of 2012, my mom retired from her job in 2013, so I never got the chance to look at anything even if I wanted to, maybe a couple times here and there if her and my dad went out somewhere but that was rare. I definitely haven't looked at anything in the past 6 years at least, and especially after my dad got arrested. I still looked up p--n on Google, as I did struggle with an addiction to it, but was a lot more careful about what I looked up, like typing ""women"" instead of ""girls"" for example. I even try to tell people, and most don't believe me, that I don't even remember what some of these pics looked like. Everyone swears, ""Oh, you remember, once you see it it's burned into your mind"" but I honestly don't. Yes, I remember seeing images I clearly shouldn't have but I don't remember any specifics. It was too long ago, like I said, 6-10 years, maybe even more.

Also, the officers who took me in were pretty nice to me. They kept reminding me that this was very far from one of the worst cases like this they've ever seen and kept telling me to keep reminding myself that I'm not a monster. I also looked at the warrant and saw that it was issued back in 2021, which is weird that they waited so long because it's not like I moved or changed jobs or anything, I've been running on the same routine for the past 7 years or so. One time I went out of town for a week and took a couple of day trips since 2021 but that's about it. I have a plea hearing Thursday, the attorney, court-appointed, has not met with me yet and likely won't see me until the hearing, but many including my Pastor have told me it's likely I'll just get probation, but I wanted to get some more insight on this and see what everyone else thinks because for the past month I've barely been able to eat, I have no energy, can barely move when I get out of bed in the mornings...things I used to be passionate about, I no longer care about...I'm severely anxious about all this, and severely depressed because in the last 4 years I've made more friends than I ever have in my whole life (I'm 36) and I just lost it all in a few hours. I have had some stick around and I'm truly grateful for them, and I have what seems to be a promise of a job lined up if the plea hearing goes well, and some have told me that God may just be opening better doors for me through all this but, I just feel like I need more reassurance that things are going to turn out okay. I'm also scared because I live with and help out my mom, who is 80, and she won't have anywhere else to go if the worst were to happen. She won't be able to financially or physically take care of herself. Also, one final thing to note is that I live in TX. So, if anyone can help out or can maybe give me some insight on what to expect of all this, I'd sincerely appreciate whatever advice I get.

Edit: To clarify, my computer was seized during the original 2020 raid, it was going to be searched no matter what. I had that computer from 2009 to 2020 and anything I had looked up on that computer was in the early 2010s. I never got that computer back. The warrant was issued in 2021 and I had no idea about it until my arrest about a month ago.",6,10.0,2024-09-24 15:16:34,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1foezhr/my_situation/

1fnznnb,post,Are there any resources for psychiatric evaluation? (California),"Hey guys, does anyone know of any licensed psychiatrist or psychologist within the state of California that can perform an evaluation in order to determine if someone is a pedophile?

I know of casomb.org but so far the ones I’ve called require a referral from the court or open case. Everything I have is pending and I want to do this to kind of show I’m not a pedo.

In doing so, I am realizing just how difficult it is to get treatment for this in the USA and this is crazy. You either already need to have been convicted or you can go to a regular therapist but they aren’t really certified and also can be required to report what you say to law enforcement. Just think it sucks if someone who hasn’t offended yet goes out to try to seek help. It seems they only care that you offend so they can throw you in jail then therapy and show the public that they provided you with treatment.

Anyways sorry for my rant but do you guys know of any that I can pay out of pocket and doesn’t require an open case or referral? At this point, I am willing to travel anywhere in the state. Also if maybe there is a search engine for this that I may have missed?

I know there’s some kind of grandfathering-in clause where people who have established residence before a school opens can stay there, but if they move they loose that privilege. How hard is it to find non-restricted housing if you move to MO?

Sorry there are so many questions, just trying to weigh my options. Appreciate any advice or insights.

1fnendl,post,Seeking employment advice for my partner,"First off, I'd like to say I've done some research and have a general idea of what's possible and not possible and the advice I'm looking for is more life experience vs reality of what to expect.

My ultimate goal is to help him become more financially independent. He's poked into going sovereign, in my understanding not valid at all but only mention for context/better advice.

I've read that trade and union jobs have a higher chance of getting a foot in the door and that is on the table but my real question is work from home jobs. I currently work from home and have poked HR with questions and basically been told ""every situation is different""

I'm curious if anyone has managed to obtain work from home positions as a RSO or has any advice in that direction. I've seen too many mixed answers on it.

Additional info: he was convinced 12 years ago, served 10 and got out a little over 2 years. To my understanding for a background check, specifically with my company he ""shoulc"" be fine. Apart of helping him become financially independent he wants to go back to school for computer graphics/IT work.

Forgive me if everything seems all over the place, spent the weekend doing alot of extra research and my brain is slightly fried. Any advice would be appreciated.",14,14.0,2024-09-23 07:13:27,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1fnendl/seeking_employment_advice_for_my_partner/

He has been a model client for his attorneys because he truly wants to change and hated himself, but didn’t have the personal strength or know where to find help to extricate himself from a porn addiction that spiraled out of control to downloading and sharing CSAM. Although fired from a lucrative career he has found work in lesser paying jobs, but is doing well in his current job. He volunteers with 3 different organizations. He is doing private counseling one, sometimes 2x per week. He is in a 12 step program and has gotten himself to a place where he can sponsor someone. He found a Dungeons and Dragons group to play with.  And is participating in a study that looks at addiction and the brain’s response.  He wants reassurances that his attorneys will fight for him. That the judge will see what he has done and that he is not a threat. I want to understand why, if someone has truly shown their regrets through taking the steps, without input from counsel, to amend their life and demonstrate deep remorse and enlightenment about what they did to then have it all taken away.  To be put on a list that strips that person of everything they worked for and wanted to change.

1fmk4io,post,Jumped at Work ,"Was at work tonight and had my first instance of someone trying to attack me for my offense and registration. I work as a server and the manager who hired me is fully aware of my situation and all that. Knows about the PO, felony, charges, and everything and still hired me on to be a server. I was helping pass out food to a table that had an old coworker (her and I adore each other) her and her boyfriend. She was also with her friend, who I recognized from helping her before at the former job. With the friend was a man, who is friends with my older brother. They are also coworkers. I wasn’t even serving their table besides handing out food and that’s it, when they were getting ready to leave he asked me to go outside and I just assumed it was for something for one of their people they were with. Since he was with my old coworker I had assumed that everything was cool. As soon as we stepped outside he jumped at me and tried pushing me into the wall. I didn’t really budge anywhere, to my own surprise, once he pushed me he kinda went back and just started yelling “you like little girls you suck f*** you like that s*** huh” and I just tossed my hands up and before I could get a word out my manager who knows came running out and grabbed him and pushed him back telling him to stop. My manager kept telling me to go back inside and just to go and two of my other coworkers ran out to help. I went back inside and went straight to my former coworker and told her what just happened. She’s also fully aware of the situation and immediately started to comfort me and tell me that’s not okay and that regardless I don’t deserve that kind of treatment and just kept consoling me about everything and telling me about how I deserve to feel safe and especially at my place of work. About 15-20 minutes later as I was getting back to work my manager came back and just told me to drop everything and that he was gonna take care of it and to go home. By the time I got into my car I had already started crying and drove home and just kinda broke down. I talked to my older brother about it since the guy who jumped at me is his coworker. I’m still kind of shaking and crying. Does anyone have any advice or anything on how to deal with these kinds of situations? Posting in this group has recently become a comfort for me.

1flpzsh,post,"Leaving for jail in a month and half. Advice,Story,comments,help","Hello all,

Long time lurker. Joined about a year and half ago, My case ended with me pleading guilty after a year and half of litigation. I had a one in a million type of case and its been hard on my family the most. I've been a legal Permanent Alien(lol) for 22 years. I Joined the army NG at 19 and this case and naturalization happened at the same freaking time...awesome luck huh? So eventually I'll be deported. The weird part is no one knows really when.

My terms for sentencing will be a lower charge, 120 days in County Jail, Probation, Registry. All in all for what this case is, its a good deal...for an American. You all have shown me that life **IS** possible with living on after something like this happens. Its inspiring that you all are in control of your lives more than ever. I just pleaded yesterday so the news is still hitting me. I did it over zoom. I felt like I was going to throw up the whole time. Sitting in court will be rough as hell in about a month and a half for sentencing.

  
I have a lot of questions in life. I made mistakes. I haven't been able to let go of the past. My victim has been contacting me though new accounts each month, sometimes twice. Videos of her saying she was sexually assaulted and other taunting posts. I told my lawyer and its helpful but not really. I was with her for four months and over the that time I made four trips. On the first trip they said they'd show me some ID because they wanted to drive my car. After about a month of talking to them I agreed. Being nineteen and having had drivers training they drove pretty well. Had a few bad moments but I believe those were because of excitement. I confronted them about the ID looking weird. **Their own mother** told me they were nineteen. That was the moment I should have left them. It wasn't just sex. I lived in two states over. Fourteen hours of driving....one way. I was really in love. I was twenty, them nineteen, we talked every single day. ALL THE TIME. I was working at a steel mill at the time, loud machine noise, barley hear me talking, 7-30am to 5pm M-F. They were there almost 70% of the time. Hell we joked about them MOVING to my state and joining my position, I was going so far to facetime them during work(with my boss permission) and TEACH my saw machines and how we cut them!!! Boys, they were taking notes....I mean....WHAT the heck. When I got home we video chatted and played video games together. It was....everything I ever wanted. 

I have to admit this time frame was about five months after I lost a two year relationship with a women who I also loved. She is still in my life. Her mother is too, she really likes me. Went over there recently and chatted with all of them and have their support. The victim wasn't a rebound as I had a fwb :> Not sure if that's important. Some of my friends asked if If she was a rebound from my ex and theorized with me that I may have over looked her ID because I loved her so much. It makes sense, I did question her age. Its a fact I had to admit to in my plea. I did however manager to get name drop her parents in somewhat getting on the record the fake ID incident and her telling me **ON VIDEO** she was nineteen (Nothing happened obviously.)

 The court is already aware of the victim. They have already had a case before me. When I was **WITH** them, the case was still ongoing. This guy was bad. That was the victims excuse to say ""You can't meet my parents, they don't trust guys."" *RED FREAKING FLAG*!!!! Ignored by me because \_\_\_\_?\_\_\_\_ That's the part I'm trying to recover from. **WHY.**  About two weeks ago, the victim, got another case. I don't want to share details but she **TARGETED** an adult with learning disabilities. How can she get help? What the heck is going on in that house? What is the state doing to protect **MEN** from girls like this? I don't know if I can speak like this without making me sound weird. The victim will give an impact statement either them or the state. Does she deserve to lie? She's talked to the state pros. already and nothing major happened. My terms speak for themselves. Of course I'm assuming she will lie in the first place. Time will tell I guess. I'm great at rumination. Overall I do believe she won't lie or make up stuff. Just wondering what it could be? Haven't heard from her in year and half or more. It's just always in the back of my head unfortunately, 

This post lost all track. The OG title was ""going to jail, what game's should I play before I go?"" Still wondering boys. Just watched the borderlands movies( Omg D: ) so I'm thinking of doing a borderlands playthough. Minecraft, csgo, battlefield,battlebit, mw3(2011),  BO3 Zombies. Let me know if you play any of these games! Would be cool to play some matches!

I could talk more. My therapist says I need to talk. If you have questions I'm happy to answer. Thank you for reading. Hope your day/night goes well!!!

1floyon,post,Advice for no internet hobbies,"Whether during pretrial or pre-release or supervision, with my restrictions I am looking at at least 6 months without the internet, as I complete my BOP time on home confinement. 

My wife gave me the talk last week and said that she doesn't want to feel pressured into letting me use her devices and I don't want to anyways because it could be bad for my future polygraphs.

Exercise - I'm putting together a home gym to keep up the fitness I attained in prison.

Baking and cooking - I started baking bread like everyone else during the pandemic and can't wait to get back to that.

Guitar - I suck at guitar but nows a good a time as any to try and break through and learn some songs.

Crochet - Learned how in prison, got pretty good. Maybe I'll make some stuff and sell it on etsy.

Woodworking - I really want to get into this, but I don't have tools or a workshop.

And obviously I'll be looking for a job and working full time ASAP.

I read so many stories or hear about them inside the halfway house or in prison abut guys that there whole life is online or playing videogames and scrolling through internet culture. I think a good thing to practice are interests that don't involve these things, in case you may be disappointed when a PO tell you to kick rocks when asking about internet access.

It's also our 10 year. As well as marks 2 years of him not living In The home...

He is going threw allot mentally and I am struggling to understand what he doesn't say... I am also going threw allot as well and when I try to address it, it just causes more problems...

1fk4kjv,post,Depression/Anxiety Meds,"Hello everybody. I have had the hardest time at trying to find happiness again after my conviction 2 years ago. Part of me wants to keep living in this nightmare so I constantly remind myself of what I've done and the pain/trauma I've caused the victim as well as who I've lost as a result but part of me wants to feel happiness at times again.

The part of me that wants to continue living in this nightmare is because I've lost the only girl I've ever loved and ever want to love after 10 years of being together and have a child with. The part of me that wants to feel happiness at times is because I haven't been apart of my child's life in 2 years and I miss them dearly, also I literally can't bring myself to go outside of my house other than work and I would just enjoy getting out from time to time. 

I just got home from speaking with my PO about vaping THC every now and then to ease my mood but she will not approve this. She brought up a valid point that it seems I just want to cover up the things that I'm going through and in a sense she is correct. She mentioned taking a week or 2 to consider medication which I've always been against. I was curious to know if any of you are currently on medications to help with depression/anxiety and how it's helped you along your way.

At the end of the day I know that I am depressed but feel I have control over it, it's the anxiety that I'm overwhelmed with when I think about going out of my house that I feel I haven't been able to control so I was hoping to get advice on medications some of you may be taking that's helped with the anxiety part of things.

Thank you in advance for any feedback as well as taking time to read my post. I hope you have a wonderful day!",3,14.0,2024-09-18 21:45:57,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1fk4kjv/depressionanxiety_meds/

Just wanted to ask a question if any SO located in CA. We have an immigration case pending with my husband as he is trying to sponsor me but due to his conviction 20 years ago it bars him from doing so unless he proves no harm to me. We hired an experienced attorney we have great support and high hopes this is all had a good outcome. We have tried to obtain records from the courts and my husband probation office which he did 3 years of probation and did he time paid his due. We have tried to obtain records here and there we had success but his been trying to obtain his probation records to prove he completed probation with no problems. 

Had anyone had similar case or similar experience trying to obtains records. All this documents we already have collected will be useful when he petitions next year to be removed from the registry but for right now we are trying to collect any and as much documents we can to prove he has not reoffended and has been doing good since.

1fjlqd5,post,International Travel/Passport/cruises. ,"Our experiences with international travel
Spouse is Level 1 based on our state's risk assessment but COULD be a Level 2 based on SORNA's offense tiering system of our state was compliant with all aspects of SORNA. Conviction was almost 40 years ago. Our state has mandatory lifetime registration with no ability to be removed (but if our state was SORNA-compliant he could have been released from the registry after 25 years or less) 

For years we have traveled internationally with no problems -- including a few trips into Canada --until one time when we returned from Mexico-walking across the border in 2019.  Spouse was taken aside for questioning. He was surprised and nervous and immediately assumed it was because he was an SO.  

Questions were asked about his reason for being in Mexico (dental visits). His phone was looked at. He was NOT asked nor was it mentioned anything about the 21 day international travel notification to Justice Department. At this time we didn't know anything about it.  He did ask why he was taken aside but they wouldn't say anything.  He was released. 

Then later in 2019, we flew to Italy for a week. When we returned, we were almost expecting for him to be pulled aside again and now correctly guessed it was because of being on the registry.  So he gave me his phone and iPad before approaching the border desk to re-enter the US. The agent looked at his passport, made a call then two agents came over and escorted him to a room.  I sat in the baggage claim for almost 90 minutes. He was asked many questions. (Don't remember them all)  

A week later after returning home, I  started searching online to see why he was being pulled aside as an SO. Imagine my surprise when I found out Obama signed the international Megan's Law in 2016!! And this was 2019! No one had told us. If I hadn't been searching online for an answer, we would never have found out -- plus he could have been arrested!  He is not a computer or internet person so this isn't anything he would even have known how to search for (obviously his conviction was not computer related). 

In 2020, as we prepared for an Alaskan cruise, he called the contact person in our jurisdiction to give him the required 21 day notice per International Megan's Law that we had discovered on our own since the ship was going to stop in Canada. The detective said he never heard of anyone having to give 21 day notice and my husband wasn't on any Federal registry list but he would make a note of it in his file.  

He asked for the dates that the cruise ship would stop in Canada and requested his passport number to put in the computer, just in case. Of course, more info was actually required but the detective didn't know what was required at that time and our obligation to notify was met. It was in his ball court to do the rest. I requested an email from him stating we notified the reporting jurisdiction 21 days before travel. 

 We traveled with friends on the Alaskan cruise (never again to Alaska and never again with friends because no one knows he's an SO but siblings and now decreased parents). 

Disembarking in Canada was delayed for 6000 people because the ship security tracked down my husband. He was escorted off the ship and questioned by RCMP for almost an hour. 

RCMP told him he had to remain on the ship and was not welcome in Canada or anywhere in the UK. (To be honest, we have found out that since the US now shares their criminal data base with Canada, no one with any kind of felony, including DUI can visit Canada). 

 That morning we had a feeling this would happen because in had read on the Internet that anyone with a felony was refused entry to Canada.. I had already told my friends I didn't feel well and we probably would disembark because we had been to Vancouver several times anyway. We had thought if we don't disembark in Canada, then nothing would happen. We certainly didn't expect ship security to track him down.  I told my friends he was a ""random"" check (you know, like TSA). 

When we arrived back in the US, his ID was already flagged and he was taken aside again. We told the friends that the ship security forgot to clear him after the random check. 

At this point my husband said he wasn't going to travel internationally anymore. He was finished. His conviction papers only stated probation and that was completed years earlier. He was told after probation he would no longer have to renew his drivers license every year. But of course every new law that was passed was made retroactive.  It just made him ill thinking about it and he was too old anyway. 

I had read that passports had to have the ""unique identifier"" but he had JUST received a new passport in 2019 (the law was signed 2016) so we thought we were safe from the passport identifier--  otherwise it would not have been re-issued. 

In 2023, we prepared for a transatlantic cruise (yes, I talked him into it) and we sent notice to the detective with the full itinerary. By now, the detective was familiar with this law and was prepared to ask the questions. We also e-mailed and requested confirmation by email that he received the notice from us (for our protection) . 

I had already researched which countries still allowed people who have been convicted of a crime of sexual nature (there's a matrix online -- most Schengen countries allow offenders) I made sure the cruise port countries were allowing SO's. 

I emailed each country in which the ship would make a port call so we would receive confirmation and permission that he was allowed. 

We carried his original 40 year old conviction sheet, the email confirmation that the 21 day notification was received by his reporting officer, plus emails from the consulates that gave permission to visit.  We had absolutely no problems in any port or country. 

Our biggest concern was the fact that ships can do background checks. 

Since he's Level 1 for our state, he's not on any public registry but we were still nervous. We now travel internationally only with a sibling who knows what is happening. The fear as we approach the cruise desk on embarkation day is real and makes us physically ill as they look at the passport . But we passed the review of the passport and had a great time on the cruise. 

Now that same year in 2023, we decide to take another transatlantic cruise. (We must be gluttons for punishment) 

We submitted the 21 day notification with the itinerary to the detective in our reporting jurisdiction.  The very next week, spouse receives an email from the State department saying the Justice Department has revoked his passport because it lacked the ""unique identifier""! 

We immediately called the reporting detective in our jurisdiction to tell him the passport number we submitted is no longer valid. We then started calling the Passport Center daily at 5am to try to get a walk-in appointment before the cruise. 

We finally got an appointment in another city and drove there. He submitted his required statement that he is a registered sex offender pursuant to law ""xxxxx"", paid the fees as well as the required expedited fees since we were walk- ins. 

This particular center had never had anyone come in for a new passport when the other one ""appeared"" valid (he had to immediately mail the current/revoked passport back to the State department after receiving the email so he didn't have it to turn in at the passport center -- this created another set of problems as he had to make a statement that it was lost or stolen and why). 

The agent had to talk to a supervisior, calls were made and the paperwork finally accepted.  Then the printer broke down! We were asked to leave for the day and return 15 minutes before closing. 

We went to Costco, went to lunch, then nervously returned. But he got it. We immediately emailed to the detective a photo of the new passport with the required ""unique identifier"" prominently displayed above the photo on the first page. 

Right at that moment my spouse wanted to cancel the cruise and burn the passport so no one would see it.  But we would lose a lot of money? For that cruise.  Plus be realized it wasn't fair to me not to travel. 

 I, again, had emailed each consulate of the countries we were going to visit -- and, again, they were the Schengen countries. All emailed permission to visit. 

We did the trip. At the airport upon departure , he handed over the new passport with the ""unique identifier"" to the agent. Of course, suffering extreme embarrassment because of the statement above his picture.  Nothing was said to him. 

He was cleared to board the plane. We got to Europe and boarded the cruise ship without incident but still nervous to see if he was refused permission to board. We had plan B ready but all was well. 
. 
When returning to the US, he was waved on thru and not delayed. Such a surprise and a shock! I had his phone and iPad though just in case. 

Now we are preparing to leave again on another international trip. Our nice detective retired and we have a new contact person. We emailed him 22 days before departure with all information as required on the ""Smart.gov"" website. 

Then 19 days before departure, there is no reply from him. So my spouse called the new detective in charge. ""Oh, I haven't received anything"".  Panic set in since we're now 19 days before travel and we were compliant without giving TOO much notice.  

We verified the email address and told him the email we sent was not returned ""undeliverable"" so he checked his email again. Yes, he had it after all but he couldn't display all the photos of the hotel and cruise confirmations that were included due to the fact we  emailed him on  a secure email. (It never made a difference before). 

He asked us to email it to his personal email (that should not be right, but of course, as you know, SO's are humbly compliant.)

He told us he would email us the form from the Justice Department to complete. I advised him that our responsibility was ONLY to give notice to the SO's reporting jurisdiction and that it was his or the Sheriff Department's responsibility to complete the form and send it to the Justice Department. (I know! Kind of brave of me to say that!!). 

He then said he would have an investigator call us. She did within a few minutes and confirmed she is the one who submits the info and it appeared all was in order. She agreed it was good to email the countries ahead of time and carry those emails. She also advised my spouse to carry a copy of the original arrest conviction with the date that is almost 40 years old in case there is any question as to how old the conviction was. 

I'll let you know the results of this trip in a month. Hope this helps anyone else who wants to travel. 

Btw-- the Netherlands email to us: ""No restrictions. Have a great trip!!""  Short, sweet, encouraging. Maybe we'll move there! 

(I suppose everyone knows SO's cannot travel to Mexico, South America or Central America. Evidently the Justice Department and those countries, as well as the UK, NZ, and AUS feel every SO must also be a human trafficker.) 

When it is time to apply for the new ETIAS (Visa waiver) for the Schengen countries and the new ETA for the UK next year,  i want my spouse to apply just to see if a 40 year old conviction will ""pass the test"". 

The ETIAS website ""says"" only felonies less than ten years old will be denied entry,  except for certain dangerous crimes,  which they don't describe, explain, nor specify what those dangerous crimes are. 

Also his Global Entry was revoked after receiving it so he applied for a TSA pre-check.  For TSA pre-check, the form explicitly asks about felonies less than ten years old. His is almost 40 years old,  so it was answered honestly . . It was initially denied, then TSA asked for details of the conviction.  He submitted a copy of the original arrest paperwork with the 40 year old date. And he was approved.

My original charge was only a misdemeanor. The reason i failed to register is i had become homeless for the first time in my life, and i had warrants for Driving under suspension. I was scared, i didnt want to go in to register and then go to jail. And through the slough of friends saying they would let me stay and then last minute changing their minds, again and again it was lined up so i knew id have it solved, then suddenly it was all bust. I didnt understand the gravity of it all, and a month later i had a place to  go and registered it. No sweat. Or so i thought.

I had  a realization that if i wanted to make a life with my beautiful girlfriend i needed to take care of my warrants for driving, so i called to set court dates, and when i did, i learned that on that same day a warrant went through for failure to register. I panicked, set a court date for it, even called the detective who put out the warrant because i wanted clarity and he explained it well and i helped my understanding of how big of a deal it was. And despite setting a date i got arrested at 4:30am while snuggling my amazing girlfriend. I was shook, i was in for 2 weeks for court. I have always tried to remain compliant and not screw the system, i dont handle jail well as i dont get along well with the guards that are dicks and always i always have to argue. And the false information you get from fellow inmates thats mostly false hope, or finding out you fucked up your case because This system, its not designed to help us. Its made to protect others from us.

Around 6 months ago I was arrested for sending/possessing CSAM. Obviously I'm really disgusted by everything I've done, there's nothing I regret more than doing it.
Having said that, I'm really glad I was caught, it's lead to some major upsets and changes in my life but I think they're for the better 

I'm planning on pleading guilty, I'd already confessed to everything during interrogation, handed over my phone
What I'm wondering is what happens next? I know that I really want to prevent other people from making the same decisions that I did, I'd like to play some part in getting rid of that awful cycle of abuse, if anyone has any idea on how I can help out there that would be much appreciated 

I'm in my mid twenties, I'm aware I'll be on the sex offenders register, likely for ten years but I don't know exactly what that will entail, will I be in newspapers? I've told my immediate family and a small amount of my friends, I've been incredibly lucky and they've been so supportive but I've noticed that I've isolated myself from them, one of them even left the UK recently and I just haven't been able to message them, I assume it's due to my shame 

I have very mixed feelings on telling others in my life, it was like a physical wound the last time I spoke about it, without a doubt the hardest thing I've ever done, to think that I need to do that with everyone I care for/trust or trusts me is pretty unbearable
Part of me wants to not tell them and just keep it quiet and move on with my life, part of me thinks they have a right to know 

Sorry for the long and rambling post, I just don't have any idea what's going to happen and at this point I'll take any advice I can get

1fisu70,post,Support,"I just started browsing this group recently in search of information that might help a family member of mine who is on the registry in the States. I’ve been largely out of his business because I’ve lived out of the country for more than a decade, and lot of what happened was while I was gone. I have been told a story by other family of what happened to get him on the registry but not even sure I have all the details, but at any rate it’s a bit unfair the way the US system is obsessed with prosecuting people like candy, at substantially higher rates than much of the developed world. 

Reading through different accounts here, not gonna say everyone here is innocent but I can see lots of cases where people are sucked into the deep end of the system simply by swimming on the outskirts, by life’s circumstances.  I’ve lived pretty carefree, joking with friends or being loose about things on the outer edges of “sexual in nature”, and now I’m on constant alert for fear that I could find myself facing a judge for something so simple, such as urinating behind a tree. From what I’ve been told, my family member who is on the spectrum was convicted for something similarly not actionable. 

I’m joining this community in hopes of getting more insight and understanding, mostly to understand what my family member is subject to and how I might help him out.  And yes, to even familiarize myself with all the common ways I could get into trouble so I can avoid them like the plague.

I was absolutely terrified of my situation to a point I didn’t want to go on anymore. To be honest, I didn’t think it was possible. Being a female offender, I  felt very isolated and not understood. I didn’t really expect any different coming here, but I tried anyways. 

I’m still really scared. However, you guys have taught me it’s okay to be scared. It is really really scary and it sucks and it absolutely does feel like the end of the world, but I can do it. Not only that but I can be better because of it. Hearing all of your stories and developing the connections I have has made me believe that, truly. 

All of you are some of the strongest, most passionate, intricate, and genuine men and women I’ve ever had the pleasure of getting to know. You deserve to feel proud because not only are you here, seeking the help and giving the help but you’re doing it, you’re making it. You’re striving to get better every single day with seemingly the entire world against you and having every reason to feel demonized, but you do it anyways. How fucking insane is that. That’s not the story of the weak.

So in case you haven’t heard it yet, I’m so incredibly proud of you. I’m here for you, and I’m certain everyone else here is, too. Things will get better, you aren’t alone, and I’m so so so proud of you for being part of the change.

1fiiq6g,post,Question on Judgment vs po requirements,"Just released after doing 30 on a 60 for possession - federal. I've been in a halfway house for 6 months with a ""dumbphone."" I've been given a home confinement date (technically FLM: Federal Location Monitoring). 

My PO called my wife to go over the home requirements and said that I would not have access to the internet, smartphones, computers, etc.

However my Judgement states that I can have internet devices so long as they are monitored.

Anyone navigate this before? Some guys in the halfway house say that I will be restricted to a dumbphone until I do some treatment and my full disclosure, first polygraph and some safety plans. Others say it's a 50/50 on how strict the PO would be.

Hoping I can get a monitored phone for banking, zoom (treatment) and just being about to google things and watch youtube tutorials.

Any thoughts?

1ficp4d,post,Online Identifier Trouble,"Hey everyone,

Recently, I had a situation where a restraining order with a friend led to the discovery that I failed to register some online identifiers, something I missed due to my own oversight and having too much on my plate lately. Unfortunately, this is a felony charge, and now I'm facing a tough decision.

The police took my phone, and while they found I wasn't doing anything else wrong, they did identify the missed registrations. I’ve found an attorney who can represent me for $5,000, but money is tight for my family right now, and I’m not sure what my best option is. Part of me wonders if going unrepresented is an option, but I know that’s likely not a good idea.

I was so close to completing my minimum time on the registry too, which makes this even harder. If anyone has any resources, advice, or support to offer, I would really appreciate it. 🙏",1,22.0,2024-09-16 18:55:22,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1ficp4d/online_identifier_trouble/
1fic8kt,post,Do I divulge my history?,"I have been providing a skilled service as my job for a few years. I own my own business, but work through partnerships and book most of my jobs through a startup tech platform. I have been working closely with the founder of the platform for a few years now and we have become fairly close friends. I recently visited his home and he has begun booking me for higher profile jobs as I have represented his platform well and am quite good at my job. 
In all this time, nobody has ever asked about my criminal history. Even so, I have been working to build the business to be big enough so that I am almost never directly interfacing with clients u less they are VIP's or there is a scheduling conflict and one of my regular workers can't do it. 

Last night, he asked me to do a job for a very high profile client. They would be flying me out and putting me up, etc. Fine. Pretty excited as I really admire this person and would be honored to work for them. However, friend asked in passing id I would pass a full background check, probably expecting a quick ""yes"". But I said ""... probably not...""

He asked what he needed to know. I paused. He said nevermind for now, we can talk about it later. Got a text this morning and he wants to proceed with the job. I think he only asked about the background check because this client sometimes has high profile people (like heads of state) as houseguests and everyone coming into the house has to be fully vetted. So for this job, I guess the background check may not be an issue. 

My problem is now I down t feel good continuing to represent his brand knowing that this could come out and be damaging to his brand, especially because it's till in The startup stage. 

Not sure what advice I'm really looking for but maybe just looking for some moral support. However, I suppose advice would be nice too

Update: We had the talk. He was incredibly understanding. Decided on using another person on my team for the high profile events. FWIW I've been very fortunate that every person I've had to have this talk with has been really supportive and understanding. Added bonus, I can continue to develop our friendship without this deep dark secret",31,7.0,2024-09-16 18:36:42,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1fic8kt/do_i_divulge_my_history/

1fi8va0,post,Need Help! Realtors for RSO Florida,"Hello. I’m recently facing this reality. My husband will be a RSO in Florida. I need to find a place for him to move when he is out of prison.  We have lost all our savings. I have already informed him that he is not coming back home. After figuring things out, we will have to get divorced. 
I only see bad news about the conditions he will face, no options in Miami, no HOAs, no one wanting to deal with SOs, and all the crazy conditions in this state. But these people need to leave somewhere. Can he share a house with other RSOs? I’m not quite clear about the conditions of those living with a RSO under the same roof. All this worries me a lot. I want to help him if I can, I definitely don’t want him as a homeless. 
Is there out there an entity that guides relatives and families in this process? This feels like a punishment for the families as well. I was hoping to find a realtor to find property, rental and/or buying. I want to see options and at least make an informed decision. Any tips and recommendations will be appreciated.

I'm not a SO.I have nobody in my life (I hope) who is a SO. I actually don't even remember how I came across this thread.

That being said, this thread has been completely eye opening for me. Maybe for a reason. It's wonderful that you all are supporting each other and holding each other accountable. Encouraging each other to do better.

Just remember: you are more than the worst thing you've ever done. You can never change the past, but you can control the future. You can volunteer, help other SO's in a positive way. The person you hurt might never forgive you, or hell they might. Always have compassion and remorse, but I don't think it serves anyone to walk around with overwhelming guilt which causes self-hatred and ultimately self-destruction.

I made a comment on another post which might not have been too nice and I apologize. But I wish you all the best and I'm not sure how many of you are religious, but I'm praying for all of you. ",87,14.0,2024-09-15 15:22:42,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1fhf1ih/a_kind_post/
1fhefip,post,My experience in Europe,"Just got back from a week-long trip in Europe. Just wanted to report on how things went. Tldr, no issues except a little bit of a delay at customs back in the US.

First, a little background. Committed my crimes (Massachusetts felonies - ROC, CP) in 2003, arrested in 2004, given 5 years probation in 2006, violated probation in 2007 (technical violation, not a new crime), spent 2007-2009 in county jail. Released as a level 2 in Mass. Moved to NH in 2022, registered as level 2 here as well. 

Also, cruised from US to Bermuda and Bahamas several times before new passport rules. First trip was a shit show. They confiscated my laptop for three months when I returned. I had an encrypted folder that I did not know the password for. They spent those three months trying to get into it. Gave the computer back with the encrypted folder erased. No issues on other cruises, other than occasionally being called in for extra questioning prior to disembarking. Also flew to Barcelona and cruised to Italy and France in 2019 using same passport. No issues on that trip other than some extra questioning upon arrival in Spain and return to US. 

Recent trip went off with basically no issue. I do have a new passport with the disclaimer about my crimes. I dropped off my itinerary with my local police department about a month before my trip.

We flew into Amsterdam on September 7th. Had absolutely no issue at customs. It was very busy there which might have helped. They just glanced at my passport and waved me on. 

Took a train to Brussels a couple days later. No issues obviously since the borders are open. Couple days later to keep train to Paris. Same thing there. No problems.

Flew back to Boston yesterday. My husband and I downloaded the Mobile Passport Control app and had everything ready to go. On an unrelated note I highly recommend downloading this app. The line for customs in Boston was about an hour long. With the app, we walked right up to a customs agent. No wait. 

Once I got to the Customs agent I could tell things would not be as easy as Amsterdam. She looked at my husband's passport and had no issue with it pretty quickly. But I could tell she was examining mine more closely and kept going back and forth with her computer. Eventually she took out a slip of paper and said something on her radio so I knew I was not going to just be waved through. Couple moments later a customs official came over to escort my husband and I to the secondary screening waiting room.

This was the same thing that happened when I returned from Barcelona in 2019. So at first I was not at all concerned. But it was at 4:00 p.m. which just happened to be shift change for all the officers. It was a little concerning to see so many officers arriving while I am waiting to be called up. I kind of figured it was just shift change but I also thought maybe they were getting ready for a big arrest. 20 minutes later I get called up by a customs agent. As I'm walking up to her I asked her if my husband should come up with me or if I should come up alone. She said no I'm just giving you your passport, you're free to go. I took my passport and worked out the door.

So I'm happy to report that everything went smoothly. I'm not guaranteeing that it will go smoothly for everyone but it did for me. I hope things don't change too much next year when they change the rules for Europe. I definitely would love to go back.",22,24.0,2024-09-15 14:57:02,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1fhefip/my_experience_in_europe/

1fgrm3e,post,Friend is taking plea due to resources,"A close friend of mine is taking a plea deal for a crime he didn't commit. He has ran out of $$ to keep fighting and needs at minimum another $15,000 to pay for the 2 expert witnesses to help him get at least fighting chance. 


I won't get into the details but this is an continuous charge against a minor in TX which is probablythe worst state to catch this type of charge. He has taken multiple polygraph tests and passed them all, and he has taken a Psychosexual evaluation and was deemed to not be a threat/risk. 

Problem 1 - The polygraphs and Psychosexual evaluations are not admissible in court in the US. They can only be used to get better plea deals. 

Problem 2 - At the beginning he made nearly $200k annually at the start of this over 2 years ago. But his employers (he had multiple contracts at the same time) ran background checks regularly and when they saw him with an open charge, they let him go. (At-Will state)

Problem 3 - Due to loosing his income, he went from being able to afford his own defense to barely paying off his Attorney. And the courts won't allow him to use court resources that's meant for low income defendants to get the expert witnesses cause he started off making too much. 

Problem 4 - This state is one that uses the ""One witness rule"" not sure how to explain it, but this rule allows for the accuser to be the only witness without corroborating evidence. No physical evidence, no witness, etc. Just the accusation of the accuser. And the state regularly puts people away with life sentences using this rule. And this rule is almost impossible to defend against. Forcing most to plea out to avoid the life sentence. 

According to his attorney, there are several instances where the investigators led the questions in an improper manor. Additionally there is evidence to suggest the accuser has signs of ""Illusionary Truth Effect"" (brainwashing) to prove these in court he needs $8k to $10k each on 2 different experts to fight this. 

Because he is out of $$ to fight this (friends and family have helped a lot but it's not enough) he is considering taking a lower plea, that will give him a 2 year sentence and a life time registration. 

I've seen the polygraphs and the results of the Psychosexual evaluation. I know 100% he did not do what he is accused of.. but he is being bullied into a deal that will ruin his life and idk how to help him.

We've already began making plans for an effort to get a ""Special Pardon"" when he gets out in 2 years. Regular pardons in this state can get your record cleared but if you are on the registry, you have to stay on it unless you get a special pardon. Problem is, the current governor of TX has taken a stance of granting as little pardons as possible and has only granted a handful since being in office. 

My friend is the kind of guy that tries to always see the silver lining in everything.  It's his way of trying to get his friends and family to not worry as much. He already knows he is going to 1 of the 8 facilities that offer the ""Sex Offender Education Program"" (SOEP) and the ""Sex Offender Training Program"" (SOTP) the first one is a 4 month program the other varies based on need. Hell, he has already made all his friends and Family a little info packet showing them how to get on the phone list.. add to is commissary keep upto date on his location/release etc.  (He was a damn good project manager so he plans really well).

He doesn't sign the deal until early next month.  But he told me, according to his attorney it already a done deal. The DA is not budging or going to offer a better deal and the judge is known for being a hardass on SOs. 

At this point idk what to do to help him. There's no time left. There's no $$ to help. And we are just trying to find a way to help protect him while he's in there and help him rebuild his career when he gets out.

1ffwxd6,post,Questions from a victim ,"Hi all, I’m nervous and hesitant making this post. But I am an advocate for children, and a survivor of sexual abuse from my stepdad. 

I have finally moved past all of my anger and confusion with the circumstances of my abuse.  But I still have questions. I feel only he could answer. And he won’t talk to me since I’ve started asking questions/demanding communication over the abuse I went through before I can have a “normal” relationship with him. 

I guess I just don’t understand how he was a totally normal dad until I was in middle school.

I guess I just always assumed if an offender was going to offend they would do so as early as possible? 

My stepdad had been in my life since I was two years old. I don’t have a lot of memories from before the age of about 11, but the memories I do have feel very “normal”. 

And then all of a sudden it wasn’t anymore? I’m not trying to blame myself at all, or make excuses for the things that he did. But it’s never made sense to me that it felt like overnight he was attracted to me. Not just loving on me and being a good dad because he loved me as a dad, it became flirting and dating, textbook grooming. 

When I was in eighth grade, he came to my room and asked for my “consent” to make and distribute CSAM with him and his friends from work. I had met most of his friends, even called them uncles. How would that conversation even start at work? How did any of this even come up, I guess as a victim and someone who wants to help protect other children and break the cycle of victimization I’m curious how these conversations are even starting in the first place? I don’t know hopefully someone can understand exactly what I’m trying to ask because I don’t think I even do. But I will say I have enjoyed being in this community and seeing the posts.

1ffj1s7,post,It finally happened and I'm kinda relieved ,"Almost a year ago, I posted here about my situation, you can check it in my post history if you're interested (it's the only post I ever made on this account) and I just wanted to give a small update. 

  
So, almost exactly a year after google reported me to NCMEC, it happened. Yesterday, around 10am in the morning, police knocked on my door for the raid, however, everything was very calm and civil, not as scary as I feared. They were very polite, explained why they are here and before the house search commenced, they gave me a chance to explain myself, probably because I was a woman and that was rather unusual. 

I told them everything I also told you guys in my last post, and they were very understanding. They only checked my current phone and computer since, as I said, I stopped a year ago, so they found nothing on it and they offered me to voluntarily hand out the device I downloaded everything on back then, and in return they wouldn't search and turn upside down my house and not seize anything else to make the raid as quick and uninvasive as possible. I agreed, handed them my old computer and they kept their promise.

I was detained, not handcuffed though, and everyone on the police station was extremely friendly. I met with the lawyer they provided to me and about 2 hours later I was allowed to leave and go home to await the trial. My lawyer was very positive that he could get them to drop the case, all things considered, if I agree to a therapy and I 100% will, I want to finally leave all of this behind me. 

Now they said it can take a year, maybe even two before I hear anything back and I am just so relieved. A whole year, I went to bed scared every night, sometimes I stayed up until 6 in the morning just to check the windows if someone would come, I lived in daily anxiety. Now that it happened, it wasn't as bad as I feared, not nearly and I can finally sleep again. 

I know that I was extremely lucky with how all this went down, probably because I am a woman and all the stuff I had was purely fictional, but still. 

I received a lot of compassionate comments and private messages after my first post, so I wanted to update everyone who was interested. ",27,18.0,2024-09-13 01:34:39,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1ffj1s7/it_finally_happened_and_im_kinda_relieved/

I ended up getting transferred and didn’t run into any issues as I was worried about possibly needing security identification but either I don’t and they didn’t run a background check again or they did and I am ok.

1ffa1yx,post,Deregestration in Colorado ,"I apologize in advance for the likely onslaught of posts for me asking very specific questions, as my partner and I are weighing opportunities in different areas as we look to leave Texas. I may have a job opportunity in Colorado, but I want to do my research before I move there. I have lived and registered in Colorado before, but that was a long time ago and I didn’t know anything about deregistration at that point

Has anyone been through, or known someone who has been through, the deregistration process in Colorado?

I was convicted of possession of CSAM in New Mexico in 2006, which carries lifetime registration. I know Colorado has a process, but I’m not finding a lot of information on how they deal with out-of-state sentences.  if they defer to the sentencing state, or if there is a waiting period once you move to the state time conviction/release.

1ferqe0,post,CSAM Questions…,"I’d like to start with some background info… I have been with my husband for six years, married and living together for two of those years. I have two girls 12 years old and 8 months old.

I would also like to preface this by saying sorry if anything I say is offensive. I have read through countless posts here and some of you seem genuinely remorseful for your past and that is why I am coming here with questions.

Three weeks ago I found CSAM on my husband’s phone. I only saw one picture titled with “12 year old and father (insert explicit act here)”. I locked his phone and called the police. He left the home and I have not heard from him since. I filed for divorce the Monday following this.

Per the detectives, the picture I seen appears to be AI generated. They are still doing a forensic analysis on his phone and I have not heard if they have found anything else. Friday we have an emergency custody hearing to determine if he will get visitation. I honestly hope he just doesn’t show up.

I’ve spent the last three weeks researching all I could about how I missed the signs, how big of a threat he is to my baby, etc.. At this point I do not feel comfortable having him around my children and I don’t think I ever will. I’m terrified the judge is going to grant him visitation and he will eventually hurt my baby.

So I’m here asking hard and uncomfortable questions with the hope of gaining some clarity.

1.) For those of you convicted of CSAM, were you ever a danger to your own children?

2.) Did the court allow you visitation?

3.) Do you trust yourself around children?

4.) Did you fight for visitation?",25,56.0,2024-09-12 02:14:04,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1ferqe0/csam_questions/

When we add any new platform or medium such as TruthSocial or Line app or X are we supposed to do it within 3 days of when we added or can we add it at the yearly update without repercussions, charges, violations?

I’ve tried to do my own due diligence search on the and in the Illinois statute and can’t find anything regarding when we are required to update social media information. In fact it’s maddening how hard it is to find pertinent relevant information on any of the searches I try with the State’s online version of RSO requirements.

The court had decided that an ankle monitor wasn’t necessary for me during my Probation period. I went in and did all the stuff and everything was fine.

I checked in and as soon as he called me back he told he was gonna be putting an ankle monitor on me and that it was necessary for probation. I immediately started defending myself telling him about the DA and the judge both agreed that an ankle monitor wouldn’t be necessary and that I was not required to have one. His only response was okay but our system says you need one so I’m putting one on you. I asked to contact my attorney and he refused to let me contact him until after I put on the ankle monitor. Does anyone have any advice and what I can do? I’ve tried contacting my attorney and their office but no response at all.

I work from home and have two internet boxes, one for work, and the other for family/friends. I do cyber security and cloud services, and many of my customers won't be happy with their private company data being monitored. 

2. Will cops be allowed to look through all buildings or just the one he'll be living on?

Not much of a big deal, just more wondering what to expect.

3. As he will be recently being released, would it be wrong to lay ground rules for living here?

I want to make sure he is doing all he is required and him not land in prison again.

1fdb7ni,post,My Spouse is Making it Miserable,"The uncertainty of where my court case would go finally came to an end this week when my plea deal was granted by the court on Thursday. I had been originally charged with 2 counts of possession of cp and 1 count of distribution of cp. My plea agreement reduced the charges to 1 count of possession of cp, with all other charges dismissed, and sentenced me to 3 years of probation and home detention, of which 1 out of every 3 days served will be suspended, so in the end it will total just about 2 years and 2 months of actual time served. Although the entire situation and circumstances that took place and the impact that they've had on our life are all bad, this was certainly the best-case scenario for an outcome to make the best out of a bad situation. It would have felt nice to know I could come home and, at the very least, feel that moment of relief and be told something comforting and then be allowed to just move with the work of getting back to putting my life back together. Unfortunately, I'm just not allowed to do that.

I was arrested in March of this year, and when that happened no one was more surprised than me. I honestly had no idea what was going on when the arrest took place, and it wasn't until the detectives interviewing me finally told me why they were speaking to me that I had any idea what was happening. And even then, I was still convinced they had made a mistake. I'm not going to get into the technical details of why and how my case unfolded because it would make this post novel length, but I'm more than happy to share that story with anyone who's curious and wants to learn more about it to avoid the pitfalls I should have been smart enough to avoid. But what is important here is that the day I bailed out of jail and returned home my wife stood with me in our bedroom, crying, hugging me as I profusely apologized and swore to her that I had no idea what this was about, and her telling me she didn't care what it was about and that ""*the only thing that matters to me is that we do whatever we have to do to keep you out of prison...we are going to fight this together, and you're not going anywhere...we are in this together and whatever we have to face, we're going to face it together and get through this.""*  

It's now September 10, 2024. Life has been pure hell since that day in March, and most of that hell has come from my spouse. From the person that said, ""*we are going to fight this together""* and who said, ""*whatever we have to face, we're going to face it together*"". I want to make it clear; I completely expected my wife to file for divorce the day I was arrested, and I wouldn't have blamed her if she did regardless of the facts of my case. But when someone makes an unprompted declaration of support and devotion, when they go out of their way for days to convince you of their bulldoggish dedication to protecting you and your marriage, a swift and sharp about-face is very painful.

She's been pure anger for the last 6 months, and going into the final days before my plea hearing she had asked several times ""is there any opportunity that you could get a reduced sentence?"" or ""is there anything you can do to get a better outcome"", questions I was constantly finding irritating because I had to remind her that a plea deal is a closed-ended contract with the state, not a barter. So it was surprising when the judge gave his order to grant the 3-year probation and added the provision to grant me suspended time for executed time. When I got home from that hearing and told her the result, not only did she not even look pleased, but she simply just said ""*why would they do that for you? just to be nice? why would they want to offer you something like that?""* I said, ""*I just thought maybe you'd see that as some good news since that was something you'd asked me about several times.""* To which she replied ""*No... there’s nothing good about any of this, how can you see anything that has happened here as good news?""*.

Last 4 days have been the worst of the last 6 months. They've been the worst of our 23 years of marriage. They've been the worst of my entire life. I feel like this should have been a time I should have been able to finally feel a little bit of happiness or at least relief again, but instead I just feel worse and more miserable and more worthless than ever. It's been one very long, non-stop and continuous argument since I got home from court on Thursday that just won't end. I just want to move on with my life and put everything behind me, but I can't. She's stuck and won't let me go.

On Thursday we kept fighting until 2AM. I was demanded to explain my plan for getting a job (and not just ANY job but a job that would provide sufficient income to cover what she expected me to cover to replace a significant portion of my previous lost income) and expected me to chart for her how I would meet that demand. This is on top of the fact that I've already liquidated my 401K, cashed out ALL my investment holdings, sold 2 of my cars, and was given a buy-out when I was released from my job after my arrest. In total, I dumped over $100,000 into our checking account after my arrest. Since the day she said ""*We are going to fight this together""* she used her credit card to make the initial $10,000 retainer payment for my attorney and hasn't paid for anything else other than her standard monthly expenses since. But yet, she has refused to curb her spending, she has refused to make any changes to her lifestyle, she has stopped me from selling the last of my remaining cars that I own (she has her own car, these have all been mine), and even though we both agreed very early that our final emergency parachute if we needed it would be to sell our home (which is worth nearly $2M), she has now told me that our home is the only thing keeping her here and if we sell it she will be moving away to another state or to another country because she's wanted to leave for a long time.

After walking her through my job search plans for nearly an hour, she finally ended that conversation by saying ""*there's really no point in having this conversation because you'll never find a good job again in your life anyway.""*

In the last 4 days she's called me a narcissist (because, as she explained, a narcissist is someone who believes something to be true and doesn't change their mind when another person tells them they are wrong), told me that she wants a divorce but hasn't decided if that's what she will do yet, told me I will never get a good job, told me that she will never support me and give me encouragement in the same way that I supported her during both her immigration (my wife is not a natural US citizen...we met in college and she was a foreign student Visa holder, I did all the work to sponsor her for her Green Card and her US Citizenship, which is an incredibly long, demanding and intrusive process for the US Citizen sponsoring the immigrant through that process) and during her time away from her career to earn her Ph.D. She told me I'm a pathological liar because she looked up my court documents and saw that my official court record still showed a sentence of 1,092 days, and I had to explain to her that yes, it does, because that's what I was officially sentenced to, but I was granted 1 day to be suspended for every 3 days that I serve of those 1,092 days, so once I reach 75% of those days, I'll be free. She then pulls out her calculator and says ""*75% is 819 days. That's 2 years and 2 months. You told everyone you'd be free in 2 years. You're just a pathological liar.""*

She asked me if we would get a divorce if I'd be willing to just walk away from the house and let her have it without the need to buy it from me. On Sunday morning I woke up to her in the kitchen and asked if she wanted breakfast and she responded, ""*would you be willing to move out and live with your mother for the next 2 years?""* I just shook my head and said ""*You mean the next 2 years and 2 months?""* and walked away. My wife collects expensive wine and is a very avid wne drinker. Finding out that we are not allowed to own/possess liquor in the home due to my home detention really sent her into orbit. So far she's refused to remove her wine from the house and she's refused to sign the co-habitation agreement that my probation officer has given me and asked for her to sign.

This morning, she left for Los Angeles for work for the week.

I don't know how many more weeks like this I can take.

My biggest anxiety was the urgent need to turn my new car info in for a status change. No matter as I drove my new car out new smell and all....my first thought was Monday morning...I need to be at the registration office with my information.

  
Then I got a little pissed. That even with the hard work and time of saving to be able to get to the dotted line. My first thought was compliance on the registry. More anxious than happy....and it had nothing to do with the price tag.

  
So there I was waiting to give a piece of paper with my new info to my registration officer only for her telling me I will need to come back when I get the real plates and the number.....or could even fax it in. 

  
Public safety indeed. 

  
I looked around in a space full of registrants. Nobody wanting to be there, sour faces, and beaten down looks for this useless exercise. 

  
Even buying something new gets tied back to this ""civil"" penalty from decades ago. 

  
That is my rant.

1fd6p8j,post,Lawsuit Challenging Missouri's SORA Law,"For those of you who aren't aware, Missouri is considered one of the most draconian states for registration. There's a Halloween law, residence and travel exclusion zones, and a tier system that doesn't reflect dangerousness. They collect and publish ""online identifiers,"" and make the entire registry available for download, allowing third party sites to easily republish the data elsewhere.

However, a group of RSOs AND THEIR FAMILIES have filed a lawsuit challenging the registry and its many additional burdens. I am publishing a link to the most recent amended complaint:

https://acrobat.adobe.com/id/urn:aaid:sc:US:527d90ee-051b-4703-9e75-c41ede7daa08

There is a hearing in November about the science(!) behind many of the claims presented, which will present many of the statistical underpinnings of the petitioners' arguments and show that the registry is untethered from any government interest in keeping the public ""safe.""

This is a court, so things will take a while. Also, a win on any claim is likely to be contested in the Eight Circuit US Court of Appeals (which will also not be quick). However, it's worth a glance for the data alone, as it includes statements from several researchers who discuss the punitive effects of SORA and that it fulfills not government purpose. And, if this lawsuit prevails in any meaningful sense, there's a good chance the groups working together to bring it will be able to export this model to other states for lawsuits there (with varying degrees of success, of course).",36,29.0,2024-09-10 01:52:20,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1fd6p8j/lawsuit_challenging_missouris_sora_law/

1fcs5e7,post,Confused about travel,"Canadian here in Ontario. I'm coming up to the yearly renewal of my life time on the SOR. I have always wishfully thought to take a vacation. 

Today when I was scheduling I was curious and thought to ask: if I travel, beyond notifying...what happens? Does the other country get notified? What's the deal here? The guy on the line told me a travel notice is issued and forwarded to the RCMP who determine your risk. Based on this, they decide to notify the visiting country or not.

He then said the closest you can get to asking is to call the OPP and ask for the offender management unit there. I called them and they referred me to someone out in Aurora, ON... no answer so I left him a voicemail. 

I'm afraid because I want to travel to Dubai and the gulf (family). But I don't want to be sent back... and I surely don't want to be detained there.

Don't mind me... I'm just peeved that no one here can 100% tell me (not to blame anyone) and there's no straight answer. 

Any insight is highly appreciated.  ",5,16.0,2024-09-09 15:26:23,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1fcs5e7/confused_about_travel/

1fcfjku,post,NJ POS/DIST Charge Procedure,"Looking for anyone prosecuted in NJ. We are experiencing a really complicated procedural process, even the lawyer is pissed about it. Seems to be happening with a lot of clients he said. 

Background: The sting was in Dec. 2022, husband was released a few days later, on pre trial monitoring, first appearance was April 2023. No discovery turned over. Judge gave prosecution 90 days. July came and went. They never filed or handed over discover, so the charges were dismissed without prejudice. We were so happy thought it was all over. February of 2024 we get a call they're refiling the charges (the ""without prejudice"" part of the dismissal allowed them to do this). This thing started all over. The prosecutor spoke to laeyer about potential plea deals then went radio silent. Turns out they were fired. Got a new one, and i believe in July it was agreed to waive the indictment if he could submit mitigation packet for a plea deal (or something along these lines). We heard back this Friday they are going to rearrest my husband, re-release him a couple days later, put him BACK on pretrial monitoring, and start the process all over again (simply bc they can). 

I feel like I'm living in that movie Groundhogs day. It's been almost two years of limbo and now the cycle restarts. The new prosecutor has not sent over discovery, says he will after the indictment comes down.. I think (date tbd). But he spoke to our lawyer said he is looking at offering 6 years prison eligible for parole after 2 years. The charges are second degree poss/dist., but we are positive there is no distribution. I would think he is going to have to considerably lower that 6 years ""offer"" once the distribution comes off. Considering distribution takes a 5 - 8 year possession charge up to 10 - 12. Since he already stated 6 there is no way after distribution comes off 5 years flat would make sense for possession since thst is mandatory minimum. At that point what is the point of even plea dealing, may as well waste court resources and go to court if going for the 5 anyway?

My questions are:
1. Has anyone from NJ gotten stuck in this vicious procedural cycle?  Please explain howblong did you wait for indictment by the State? After indictment how did this progress and how long did it take?
2. Did you fight any of the charges?
3. What was your initial plea, did it change, higher or lower?

My husband understands there will be consequences. We accept that. We just want to get that started so he can be done and we can move on from this. We appreciate he has been a free man for the last nearly 2 years but we haven't been able to do anything move, have kids, make future plans.. bc we don't know what is coming down the line.",2,18.0,2024-09-09 02:56:38,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1fcfjku/nj_posdist_charge_procedure/

Maybe I'm wrong idk. He got all irritated hasn't talked to me since just went to bed. Am I wrong for wanting to try to get a plan approved.

1fasb2t,post,Evicted and camping,"So. We wound up evicted and without a place to live this past week.

 I have been unemployed for over a year now. This is the longest I've gone without a job since 2008-2010.

The landlord said he'd give us time to get our stuff out..... We have had 3 weeks. No income to work with, no storage, and no help until we're literally on the street from local NGOs. 

Now it's down to the wire. Because of unique title issues (thank you Michigan and Wisconsin child support agencies)I cannot even sell, or title my vehicles right now. Our church basically told us they don't know how to help us(or they don't want to, because my wife was making $200 a month cleaning, and they fired her Tuesday, knowing we're on the street). Or because ""We don't have a way to pay you, and we never pay cash"" Their excuses were lame and a cop out. They refused to pay for a campsite, which is only $120 a week.
Even though this great land of ours was settled by pioneer families THAT CAMPED WHEN THEY HAD TO, my family isn't allowed to do that. 
This is also the same church that in the last 3 weeks 5150'ed me, and called CPS on our family. They literally asked this past Sunday to let them take our kids.... But no help for me. ""We could provide a place for the 2 youngest here at A, put your wife and 2 oldest 13 miles away at B, and you, LowerSupermarket, have to fend for yourself, and the dog"" My wife and I didn't find that acceptable. At all. 
My wife cannot drive, and the vehicle we do have isn't even ours, but a beater given to us that isn't safe to drive the 25 miles to Wal-Mart. 

All of these people from our church could hypothetically help us, either with storing some of our things, parking a truck, or even camping out in their 7 acre backyard. But they refuse. The people who are NOT able, have all come to us privately and been apologetic at the least for not being able to help.
The people who could clearly help, and will not? They're the ones that fired my wife and took our church keys away. (We are again the only members of our congregation without access to the building as needed.)

The landlord and realtor valued the property at 10k. We've paid more than that in rent in the 2.5 years we've been here. He said any of my things will be considered abandoned  after Monday at 9am and if I try to retrieve them, he'll consider it trespass. My work truck is broken in the driveway full of tools I can't seem to get anyone to buy(at bargain prices no less) and it has a lien, so if it gets taken by the landlord, I get into trouble. 

He said my best option in his(miserly opinion) is to find some one or some way to come up with a down payment or payment plan or something that amounts to 10k. 


There are jobs. But I'm now into the season of college kids being back, and jobs are scarce again. Short of stealing or robbery, I am doing ALL the things to make money I am capable of doing . 

I am sick of this. I've been down, but this is the worst. I'm so tired....... ",5,13.0,2024-09-06 22:47:27,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1fasb2t/evicted_and_camping/

1fa4pzw,post,Possession quantity question ,"Sorry if I am in the wrong place to ask this but I think this is with in the scope of this group. 

My parent is being charged with possession of cp. originally we thought that he had maybe a couple thousand images max, and we thought that number was incredibly high. We just recently found out that he was in possession of several million images and videos. I have been having a hard time finding other cases online in that same scope quantity wise. Most of the stuff I see people are reported having like 100 images. Is my parent a major outlier and has an unusually high number of images? Or is the size of their “collection” fairly common? I know things can be “counted” differently from state to state so we are having a hard time understanding what exactly to expect as this all progresses. Thank you. 

Edit to add charges have not been filed yet. They are still working on a couple hard drives and phone. The detective on the case was just nice enough to inform me what they had so far when I asked. So I think that when he says millions of pictures and videos that doesn’t take into account that videos are counted as multiple pictures, but I could be wrong. I also don’t know how many terabytes all this is. I was not given that number.

1f8w07y,post,I guess it's time for me to just yap for a bit,"Well, a few weeks ago, I finally quit my job. It was around 5pm and I decided to just leave. I was tired of the upper management, the drivers and the customers I was dealing with. The first few days were rough. I didn't eat at all or sleep well. I was in this state of disbelief honestly. It was such a easy job and I still feel a bit of a idiot to quit but... I'm happier now I suppose. I haven't had to take my anxiety medication which was amazing and odd because it's really not a stressful job. It's just annoying.

I had several reasons for leaving but mostly it was because of I didn't believe in what upper-management was doing to the policies and I couldn't move up. I don't have a license at the moment and I really don't know when I'll be able to get one.

I found a temporary job making a bit less money and less hours but it's getting me by. My second day at my new job I literally wanted to kill myself. The depression was getting to me but I fought it hard. It's just not worth it. I do miss my benefits and stuff. I got sick a few days after I quit my job which sucked. Then just as I was getting better, I got strep throat a few days ago. Man. And I've been dealing with car problems and it's just... sometimes the grass isn't greener on the other side BUT it depends on how you water it.

I'm at a point in my life where I need to decide on what makes me happy and so far I'm happy with the decisions I've made in the past month. I have a lot of work to get where I want to be at and I know I can do it. I will do it. I made it this far. I will not fail.

1f89tse,post,Done with my sentence!!!! ,"I’ll start by saying that I was arrested and pleaded guilty to one count of attempted Sexual Communication with a child. This was an egregious lapse of judgement on my part, for which I will 
never seek to minimise or justify. The work during my sentence made me realise that there were circumstances that triggered the thought patterns which led to the offence (death of both my parents, plus trauma I hadn’t addressed), but the decision to commit an offence was one I made, and I must live with that.  

I received a sentence of 2 years in the form of a community order. Basically: you have 2 years to meet the following requirements. Mine were to complete a sex offender specific group work program, and have meetings with my probation officer. 

I have now completed the requirements, and the deadline is the day after tomorrow. That final meeting with probation was glorious. As I said to my brother, completing this sentence is a major achievement, but not one I can boast about.

1f84prh,post,"My experience in NE Ohio, off papers now - early! There is hope!","Back in the Summer of 2022 I was on an adult app (like Tinder/Grindr) and was accused of inappropriately speaking with a minor/planning to meet up. Long story short; It was a string operation and they got me and several other guys.

Some were charged more harshly than others as they did more than just talk (shared photos, actually went to the trap house, brought harmful material/tools). I had my ""planning to meet"" dropped because I hired a good attorney and proved I had no such plans/wasn't at any sort of agreed meeting place, etc etc.

Initially I was incredibly scared, there were so many horror stories here on reddit about how I would probably get prison, and how bad that would be, where I would go. How bad probation is afterward... how the PO would make my life a living hell, how I would probably be homeless because my parents had a gun in the house (locked away safely in an area of the house I did not inhabit in any way). How I'd be subjected to lie-detecting tests. How I'd be lonely and miserable. I was terrified, lost a lot of weight, panicked about everything, was paranoid that people LOOKING at me just knew some how. Came here to reddit and studied how my life would be forever changed and horrible...

I took a plea deal that landed me as a Tier 1 in Ohio because some inappropriate things were still said, no matter how much I thought the person was lying about their age/didn't look their age... I said the stuff before their age was mentioned... but that's another discussion entirely that I just want to forget now and move on. By the way, this plea deal came THE SAME DAY as my Trial. Which totally didn't help with my nerves. Up to the final minutes I was a panicking mess. You can see in my previous posts me worried about it.

Well, I got sentenced to only one year of probation. No prison time. No lie-detectors, no evaluations. My attorney assured me it would be a cake walk. I was still a little scared but it felt like things were looking up. He was right though, it was a cake walk. Not only did I get off 2 months early (I tried for 6), but also my probation officer never once asked to see my phone, nor came over my house planned or unplanned. I even got to skip a month. Of course I followed all the rules he set for me, but I wasn't monitored at all. No phone monitoring apps, nothing on my computers, no ankle monitors. He told me I could play games, surf the net, go grocery shopping, drink alcohol. Just couldn't do drugs, and just had to play it smart and leave situations where a lot of children were present. I was allowed to be around my nieces and nephews. I stayed away from reddit, and facebook, just to be safe, but I feel like I honestly could have used them if I wanted to.

I worked 3rd shift just to keep my mornings open so I could see my PO once a month. I did have to see a counselor in a group setting for 12 weeks, but that was not an issue. The counseling was very basic, and if you're a normal human being you know everything they will say, its all common sense and common empathy. The biggest problem of it all was simply the drive there and the one time I really couldn't pee for the drug test, lol.. (they let me come in the next day, they didn't make a big deal about it).

Only one kinda crazy thing happened and that was when a nosy neighbor told EVERYONE on the street about me (no idea how he found out to this day), and we had people knocking on our door saying they wanted to move away because of me and were scared for their children. My family stood up to every single one of them, and told them how they understood their concern, but I was absolutely harmless, couldn't hurt anyone, have been vegan almost my entire life, explained what Tier 1 meant, and guess what? They all, for the most part, chilled out. Even our nearest neighbors decided to stick up for me and told our nosy neighbor to fuck off.

With that being said, when I am taking out garbage and I see the kids coming down the street to walk to their school bus stop, I will go back inside and just wait for them to pass. I don't want any trouble at all, so I will mind my own business.

I've lost a lot of friends while the whole thing went down, but I've made even BETTER friends afterward. There is hope for us! If you are open and honest with people, are able to read people well, and know the right time to tell them, they WILL understand. Despite the mistakes we've made, we are still human and deserve happiness, companionship, and love.

I just wanted to share a positive story on here for once. The fear REALLY got to me in the early days while I was waiting for all the court stuff. It took over a year for me to finally be sentenced and that was the worst part of this whole process. After that a huge weight was lifted off me. Now that I'm off papers I really do feel like I can live completely normally from here on out, and just make my yearly visit.

Speaking of, the icing on the cake, the people at the registration office are REALLY nice and understanding. During part of my first visit they were going through my paper work and noticed there was a lack of any victim information. They asked me about this because they had to put it in their computers. So I told them; during my sentencing the judge asked ""Who was the victim?"" and my attorney spoke up REALLY FAST and said ""There was no victim. It was a police officer pretending."" the judge nodded; and so on my official registration it says I have no victims at all. Doesn't mention a minor, ages, sexes, etc. Just a blank space where that info would be. That was the truth of it, and the lady putting in the info was more than happy to leave it off. She also didn't describe my tattoos at all, or ask for any of my internet identifiers.

Also, for anyone worried about work, just go to a temp agency. They got me a job in one day, and if anyone at work knows about me, they don't say anything. I was hired in after 3 months. They all respect me, because I show up and do my job. I have even gotten raises and my boss talks about promoting me in a year or two. Work was another thing I worried about. I've been there for over a year and a half now.

By the way, all of this happened to me in my late 30's. I really thought I screwed my self for the rest of my life. I no longer feel that way.",15,10.0,2024-09-03 16:44:45,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1f84prh/my_experience_in_ne_ohio_off_papers_now_early/

I only share because it is such a hard task constantly litigating with the government 18-20 years post conviction. I do believe there is hope in the court system though.

1. Don't apply at apartment complexes. Nearly all will deny you, after the background check. The only exception you are goin to find is a small building, that is likely owned under and LLC. by an individual. They are out there, but it's not an efficient use of your search time, until you have exhausted all other options and are getting desperate.
2. Look for places that are privately owned. Not run by property management companies. See the above paragraph why. Best places to look are on Zillow and Facebook. Craigslist is probably 50% scammers, but is also useful.
3. Try to save up a couple of months worth of rent, to put down in advance, to show them you are responsible and will pay on time.
4. When I found some places, I sent the following message. Key takeaways should be.

* Be courteous and professional.
* Tell them you want to respect their time and be upfront.
* Thank them for the consideration.

""Hello \_\_\_\_\_\_,

I was interested in you place you have listed for rent on \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ located in/at \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

Before I go any further, I don't want to waste your time, or mine, and want to put out there that I was involved in a felony act in Oct of 2017, and am now required to register on the sex offender registry.

If that is a deal breaker for you, I understand, and thank you for your time.

If you are not immediately put off by that, I'd like to let you know, despite being a fool back then, I:

* Have no other criminal history.
* Have good rental history.
* have great character references (from reputable sources, not my mom) that will tell you how I have turned my life around.
* Don't have great credit but I have no history of back checks or evictions.
* Have been at my current career (making 3x the asking rent) for 6 years (also one of my references).
* If desired, I can put down an additional deposit, above what you are asking, by paying 2 extra months in advance, to ease any concerns you have.

I have no issues answering any questions you have about the details of my offense.

If you are still reading this, Thank You and I hope to set up a time to view the pace soon.""

1f5xdt8,post,One. More. Month.,"Where does the time go? It seems like just yesterday the county sheriff was knocking on my door to seize all my electronics and change my life forever. Now I'm down to a single month left on probation and it just seems so surreal - on one hand I'm excited to be able to just live my life without fear of making some stupid mistake that will get me violated and sent back to prison, on the other I'm left wondering where my life might go once I'm out from beneath the supervision of the state.

I've been incredibly fortunate to have the support of my family and a few close friends over the last 4 years. Without them I'd probably be living in a van down by the river... or worse. I'm lucky to have landed a job, albeit way below my abilities, within a month of my release and even more fortunate to have kept it. I still don't have any friends and I'm living in my parents' basement for the foreseeable future but you know, things haven't gotten worse since that fateful day I got the knock.

So I guess this post is just to thank all of you who contribute to this online community. I've learned so much by reading about your trials & tribulations, your setbacks, your successes. I've begun to accept that my past life is just that - in the past. I've been keeping my head down and just grinding away at life for so many years now that I've forgotten it's important to occasionally look up & forward to whatever the future may bring.

With that, I'm gonna go play ball in the backyard w/ some very deserving dogs, one of the few things I've always been allowed to do.",33,19.0,2024-08-31 20:58:36,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1f5xdt8/one_more_month/

1f5ns4g,post,Upcoming Sentencing/RSO Questions,"Greetings,

I have a sentencing date in September after taking a plea with the state of Florida for unlawful travel to meet a minor (sting operation on a dating app). I accepted a plea of 20 months of state prison with no probation afterwards. 

I just have some general questions regarding which level of prison I would probably be sent to (first time offender). Also, with there being no probation and I live out of state, will they be monitoring me to see if I register after release? No one in my community knows about the charges or anything. 

These stings are basically entrapping people who wouldn’t otherwise do this by using an 18+ year old on the dating app and then flipping the age while you’re on the way to meet them. I would have declined the plea but my lawyer said that they convict people all the time with this and I’d be looking at a longer sentence with probation if I went to trial.

He has a job in the kitchen, he already completed an OSHA course, he starts HVAC courses and SOTP soon, he has also started a business technology class, the only class he needed to finish his business and accounting degree when he was out, he also completed a “thinking for a change” class, and a class for victim awareness.

Our lives have been turned up side down. The truth is our lives are forever changed and the next time he comes outside, he will be in a box( medical condition).I am left to pick up the pieces of our lives. 

To the SO’s who had to do this, did you all move houses, change names, change children schools? What  did you  do to protect yourself? How did your children cope? I am in a very dark place and just need  some advice. We are all in therapy at the moment.

1f4mw9d,post,Does anyone have any success stories after being released?,"My boyfriend took a plea deal for child molestation for charges his ex wife filed after he got full custody of their child. His lawyer recommended the plea because he's seen cases like this before and said they could take up to 4 years to finish. Every time they go to court it would cost him $5,000, and this was the fastest way to get his child and life back. 

He doesn't seem too worried how this will affect his future. He's going to be a felon. He won't be able to go to events at his kid's school. I don't even know if he'll be able to pick up/drop off his kid at school if/when he gets custody back. I'm worried how this will affect him going back to court for custody but he doesn't seem to be. I'm worried about his ability to gain employment again, renting an apartment, everything.

Maybe I am selfish for thinking how this will affect our future. He is the one in jail right now.  I feel nauseous when I think to myself that I am dating a sex offender, even though I know he isn't. I know everyone says they're innocent and no one wants to hear it.

1f3rwcz,post,I want to advocate,"TD;LR: I want to advocate for people convicted of sexual offenses and show remorse, I wonder the best way to go about this from your perspective? What has been your guys' experiences throughout all this been like (e.g. prison, SO registry, probation, life in general)?

Hello all - I wanted to write this because I am trying to figure out the best way to advocate for my friend and other people in their position. I think that the most important thing for me to do first though is to talk about what I learned throughout my experience on treatment and probation.

Several years ago, I (mid 20's M) made an extremely poor decision involving a minor and faced consequences.

In treatment, we talked about ""red flags"", which are circumstances (e.g. thoughts, feelings, and situations) that led to my offense. For me, I had recently been removed from school. I was also deemed ineligible to join the military because of autism. This, along with the usual lack of employment, social skills, friends, and compounded social isolation due to COVID. A few months prior, I had found friendship with a minor male cousin. These red flags, as well as mental health issues and a lack of understanding how healthy relationships actually occur, led to an unhealthy relationship dynamic and, ultimately, a contact offense. To this day, I take full accountability and responsibility for the harm and trauma I inflicted on him, my family and community as a result of my offense and encourage others to do the same.

In treatment, I met people in my therapy group that I am very close with to this day and learned how to have better relationships with people, which for me, mainly involve other people with autism since I connect best with them. I was able to finish school, complete treatment and probation, buy a house, and generally feel a lot better about things - most of the time. I realize I was extremely lucky.

I agreed to a misdemeanor deferred plea agreement, which placed me on the sex offense (SO) registry and probation with SO terms until I completed treatment, which allowed me to get off the registry and seal my case. There are no public records or news articles about my case.

Although my life was pure hell after my offense and throughout probation (and rightfully so), because of my plea, I was able to get through everything, learn things, and live a pretty normal life afterwards. I know that like 99% of people who go through it do not get this ""luxury"". And I put that in quotes because I think it should not be a luxury to have the opportunity to be rehabilitated and reintegrated into society if you take accountability and honestly work for it.

My friend had similar red flags. He was someone I met in group who I still talk to. We are both software engineers and enjoy playing games like Deep Rock Galactic together on Steam as well as D&D - I am a level 3 wizard! He is also autistic and has trouble with friendships and was also looking for someone to ""click"" with. In short, he did with an online male minor friend whom he met online. Unfortunately, the mate he found online lied about his age; my friend thought he was 18 but he was much younger. My friend, too, has shown nothing except remorse and understanding for what he did and is a good person - not manipulative or sociopathic or anything like that. He was slapped with an online solicitation of a minor charge and is on almost a decade of a felony deferred deal. Due to the constantly changing laws, he is not sure if he will be able to leave the SO registry when his deal is done. Despite the ""deferred"" part, he will never be able to seal his case, and news stories and public records ensure he will always be a pariah within his community long after any official sentence. He has contemplated suicide and lives every day under the reality of a system and society that is unforgiving, hostile, and barbaric in ways that are unique only to people convicted of SOs. I know, even from my short and fortunate sentence, the hopelessness and unrelenting despair that comes out of a situation like this, and kudos to you guys who continue to persevere in the face of all this - I know it can be tough out there.

I wholeheartedly believe the whole ""throw sex offenders into wood chippers"" sentiment is harmful to society and may even increase any risk posed to public safety by people convicted of SOs. I remember being fascinated with the mountains of research and arguments in the field of dealing with and rehabilitating people convicted of SOs while I was going through all this which all agree that society does not do a great job when it comes to dealing with such a diverse and complicated range and nature of sex crimes and situations and lumping them all into one, monstrous category. But who cares? People are emotional creatures and care about what makes them feel best and safest, and it seems society feels safest when sex offenders are dealt with harshly, regardless of the nuances or tiers or anything like that. It may be the case that people would have to be exposed to more people on the registry or personally know someone on there to care. Unfortunately, there are a few truly dangerous people - not the vast majority of those on the SO registry - that require special attention and I do not think the SO registry is the appropriate way to handle this. But, I digress.

It is so painful to constantly see new knee-jerk, reaction-based laws constantly coming out restricting the freedoms of those on the SO registry without proof that these laws actually work. It is so painful to see stories of people convicted of SOs - like my friend - who are genuinely trying to improve being told to kill themselves, and people wishing torture or inhuman and incredibly cruel and medieval things upon them. But worst of all, it is so painful that it seems like nothing I can do will change any of this treatment to real and living human beings who - admittedly fucked up in one way or another - suffer senselessly on the other end of this since it seems like the laws will only get worse and society even harsher. I know this should in any alternate universe besides this one still be me and it still is for my friend.

As someone who managed to make it to the other side of this, how do I, just one person, begin to advocate for my friend and other people convicted of SOs who show remorse and understanding, work so hard and live the reality of this every day, and yet have no voice? To change the sentiment from that of vengeance to a sentiment of rehabilitation like it is for many other non-SO crimes? I've thought about talking to my old counselor who ran groups a few times (she is nice and an advocate) as well as perhaps talking to sociologists, professors, or other smart people. Or maybe a group like NARSOL (I sent an email and got no response) or [http://oncefallen.com](http://oncefallen.com/) (good website). Or maybe I should go the political route and talk to a congressman or something? I know I have a lot to lose if I went public with my offense and it feels like no matter what I do, the momentum will stay like this.

 I know nothing will change if I do nothing so I guess my first step is posting here.",20,20.0,2024-08-29 02:42:56,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1f3rwcz/i_want_to_advocate/

1f3h6ey,post,California PC 288a vs 287b1,"1203.4 reads

 (b) Subdivision (a) of this section does not apply to a misdemeanor that is within the provisions of Section 42002.1 of the Vehicle Code, to a violation of subdivision (c) of Section 286, Section 288, subdivision (c) of Section 287 or of former Section 288a

I take this to mean that 287c and 288a are both not expungeable 

288a used to be “oral copulation with a minor” do to confusion they got rid of 288a and created 287b1 

So does that mean 287b1 is also not expungeable? ",1,2.0,2024-08-28 18:12:55,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1f3h6ey/california_pc_288a_vs_287b1/

I (24) f am grateful for all the feedback that was given to me regarding the situation. I do want to address the situation about having older men/women as friends. I always had friends older than me . So I never thought it weird to friends older people....it's not just men. But I guess for me this behavior started back in elementary school being friends with the janitors and middle school being friends with the janitors and high school being friends that janitors and then my bus driver and yeah I just never Saw a problem with being friends with people. 
 
  On the topic of Edward we obviously are no longer friends because he did disrespect my friends privacy I feel like. Even though being on the sex offender list is public knowledge I feel as if he would not have known that Cameron was on the list if he did not go out of his way to try to find him. Because the situation Cameron is no longer my friend. That is his choice not mine. Him being on the sex offender list does not bother me whatsoever. But unfortunately I found out that Edward did contact him and Cameron just doesn't want the drama in his life which is understandable. It does suck that I have to get the backlash of this but as long as he's okay and healthy I respect his decision.",15,5.0,2024-08-28 12:34:37,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1f391f8/update_on_how_i_lost_my_family_and_friends_and_it/

I learned all but one aspect of this jobs requirements. 
Never asked for a raise it always came unsolicited by my direct supervisor.
Well...today after no raises at all for this year my supervisor went to the owner and asked if I could be employed year round at 18$p.h. from16$p.h. 
(a 2$ raise!!)

This is huge for me,I will no longer need to apply for unemployment in the off-season and I (hopefully)can pay all my bills without just breaking even.

Please-guys when all feels lost or not worth it. If you are willing to stick with it and show your worth, it is the best c.o.a. for people in our position. 

I don't think we have the luxury of always looking for the better paying positions at other companies.

I realize 18$p.h. isn't the best pay but a 2$ increase plus year round employment makes such a difference to me. 

I wish you all the best, and get out there and prove that we are not a lost cause!

It's been a horrible 1-2 months for me and it seems to just be getting worse. Between SB 249, the next years 3,000 ft rule possibly being passed and online harassment and stalking.

Everything's gone to crap. Was unable to find a place to live in NY on my own due to the cost, even upstate. Someone found my main account and branding and has destroyed ALL good reputation I've had for 15 years. I  lost a lot of great followers on Twitter and got booted from every community possible because trolls are taking the webpage from KSP's SOR info and telling people I diddle kids and am a pedo.

Which is total lies and I already showed receipts but it doesn't stop them from going into EVERYONE's replies on my followers list or following list, to spread the false info. I've been banned from 90% of things, was doxed, someone threatened me to come to my door, etc. Thanks to KY's bullshit, I go from a Tier 1 Low-Risk 70 pts score with no restriction (just expensive as hell now to be in NY), to a Lifetime reg and people assume Life = RAPIST @#@!#!#!@#@#@

Still can't get a damn decent job and most labor jobs which do pay well are CDL and I can't even drive with my anxiety/ptsd issues. (Been on SSI due to medical and mental health issues as it is but I can't even find part time work).

I even made a entire webpage using my own domain name to try to get people to see everything there is about me. From pre-birth, birth, upbringing, CPTSD, PTSD, medical issues, mental health issues, the NY thing which includes even court dockets, disposition, NY original registry form filled, the risk assessment, school IEP records, etc. I've almost ended my life in July over the repeated harassment and no one in law seems to care because there's no protection.

  
Think it's bad now? Wait til SB 249 gets enforced, which is still being fought against.

THIS IS NOT FUCKING RIGHT AND I WANT JUSTICE.

My boyfriend was was 15 and was dumb and drunk and high on Seroquel, he was at a party and got tired and walked back to his friends house where he passed out in a chair and woke up to police hand cuffing him . He was taken down to the police station where his parents were not notified . These two police officers interrogated him , he was in and out of consciousness and the police coerced him to admit to something he didn’t do and he didn’t even know what he was admitting to but after hours of being there he just wanted to go home and sleep and the police knew he was not sober and he was 15. They told him if he just admitted to it he could go home.
So he admitted to what they wanted not knowing he was admitting to raping his friends 14 year old sister who was handicapped.
They did a rape kit, dna was negative , but because he admitted to the crime they didn’t use that.
The girl made a statement but they couldn’t use that because she was handicapped.
His friend we think called the police.
His friend had some weird obsession with his mom being rapped and would tell people in detail about how his mom was rapped.
Anyways he got convicted and was charged as an adult and was in prison for 13 years, now on parole. 
His parents couldn’t afford a lawyer and now he has to register as a sex offender and he can’t be around my kid…. I hate that he is being charged as a sex offender because even if he did do it he served his time and they both were the same age.
It wasn’t like he’s attracted to five year olds.
But this has ruined his life.
Was wondering if there was any legal action to wear he can fight this . He wants to wait until parole is over which will be next year.
What legal actions can we take?
Where would we start?

I know of someone who is clearly headed down a slippery slope towards reoffending (possession of CSAM).

I know we rant a lot about how there’s really no way for someone to admit that they’re downloading CSAM to get help before arrest (unlike seeking help for general porn addiction). 

But what about someone on the registry who has already completed their sentence and then catches themselves headed towards reoffending, what resources exist? Is it a thing where registrants are going to be afraid to tell their probation officer, or their group therapist or their personal therapist (if they’re not in group therapy) out of fear of getting sent back to prison? Can CSAM be discussed in SA groups or with SA sponsors?

1f1sbfu,post,Steps to Move Forward,"Hello,

I hope my situation is allowed here; because even though I am not on a SO registry, I am still dealing with how to move forward after such a case. Apologies in advance for the long post, I really appreciate anyone who takes the time to read and respond.

Without getting into too much detail, I was involved in a case a bit over 5 years ago when I was a teenager because I had made an enormous mistake and hurt someone more than I can really understand. The case took around a year to complete and closed without any real ""punishment"", I guess you could say. Throughout the next years, I gradually believed I had closed this chapter of my life, but it was always in my mind, I never stopped thinking about what I did and the guilt/shame that came with that. I have been speaking to my therapist lately and I think a large reason why I have never truly been able to ""move forward"" is because of how the case ended and a lot of the unresolved feelings attached with it. There's a lot of confusion/uncertainty as to why the case ended the way it did, and I have been too scared to revisit that time in my life, so I still don't really understand. No one in my life besides my immediately family really know about everything that happened and what I went through during that time.

Knowledge about the case has surfaced recently and I have lost many people that I considered friends/aquaintences because of them finding out. I don't know how to process all of this. I have a partner who has decided to stay with me and a life that I'm really happy with, but since all of this has been happening, I feel like I never deserved to be this happy. I have very few people who are still in my life after learning about my past and I just feel immesely guilty for putting them through the situation of associating with me. I understand they care about me and value who I am now despite my past, but the majority of people cutting ties with me makes me feel like no matter what I do or who I have become, if/when people learn about what I did they can never see me for anything beyond that.

I would just like to talk more about this with anyone who is willing, because I don't really have anywhere besides therapy to really discuss. Everyone on this subreddit is extremely brave for reaching out and wanting to talk about this kind of stuff, and I felt motivated by everyone to try and post. Thank you to anyone who has read this much, I really appreciate your time.

1f1632y,post,Court on Tuesday to plead guilty. Terrified. Any advice? (UK),"Hey everyone. So as the title says I am in court on Tuesday to plead guilty to a single charge of ‘making indecent images’ which basically means downloading for those not in the UK. 

After waiting for over a year the day is finally here. I am absolutely bricking it. The humiliation, embarrassment, shame etc and having to stand in front of the court. I am trying to remain calm. So far I am getting somewhere  by telling myself to own it, I have taken responsibility for my actions and this is part of the process. For anyone that’s been involved with the law in this way I am sure you will understand the soul crushing helplessness, anxiety and depression. I have lost huge parts of my life. I haven’t seen my child in over a year, split with partner etc. 

Does anyone have advice on how to survive the next 48 hours and the court appearance? I would be forever thankful and for any tips or reassurance in any form. 

All the best",13,22.0,2024-08-25 20:30:47,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1f1632y/court_on_tuesday_to_plead_guilty_terrified_any/

1f0y4mm,post,Ex still reaches out,"It’s been a while since I have posted. I met someone Jan 2022 and very quickly fell for him. May 2022 he was arrested on multiple charges of communicating with multiple minors (ages 14-17) during the Covid years. 

Of course it broke me. I was going to marry this man. I tried my best to stay and support him but it’s current August 2024 and he is still in jail. Final sentencing not completed. During the first 1.5 years of his incarceration we talked daily, I spent more money than I should have communicating with him. Everytime I got the “I should be home soon” and then it failed I lost a little part of me. I eventually ended the relationship Dec. 2023 because I felt like I was in jail with him. I have depression and I had become this person I hated. A person who had literally no hope in anything, a person who only saw the negative side of everything, a person who was dead inside waiting on a man that I still haven’t been able to get the story from. When I broke it off with him after about a month, I asked to go no contact because I couldn’t move on talking to him every day. 

I have finally after 7-8 months gotten to where I don’t think about him every day, I haven’t cried to my mom about my heart break in a couple months, I’ve been on dates but they all just don’t compare to him at all. He randomly messages me and has all this hope for when he gets out which “will be soon.” He truly thinks he will be able to find a good job and have a great life after all this but because I have no hope in the Justice System or Government or people in general, I can’t respond. He lives in Tn which is one of the worse states for PFR. When he gets out, assuming he ever gets out, he wants to talk. 

A part of me wants to talk to him because I want to know what happened. I want to know the details. I want to know why he lied to me. The other part doesn’t want to re-open the wounds. 

Idk what I’m looking for in the post, I guess just needed to vent. I’m almost 30 and I’m not strong enough to continue to be with the love of my life. I can’t be with someone who lied to me. I can’t be with someone who I don’t trust. I wish more than anything I met him in 2020 before he made the choices he did. Worst part, he claims he is innocent of all but one (claims he didn’t know she was 17, claimed she was 19, they dated for a few months. She met his family, he met her family, blah blah blah. )

I truly hopes he stays the positive person he is. I truly hope he is able to find a job and be happy. I just don’t know if I can look him in the eye and tell him everything will be okay when I don’t believe it will be. This sucks. 😭💔",19,20.0,2024-08-25 14:52:04,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1f0y4mm/ex_still_reaches_out/

He will have another decade of supervised release. Basically, he had sex with a younger minor while under the influence of methamphetamine. Obviously not ok. But he has been in for 10 years and that aberration is not consistent with the person I know. 

We are not super close but he is family and I have been able to talk with him a few times during his confinement. He is being released to a small town where everyone knows him and the extended family, and folks are (unsurprisingly) not kind on the social media post about his release. I also know how hard it can be for any felon to find good employment and move forward. 

Do any of you have any advice about how to support him going forward? I cannot actually provide him work or anything, but I want to make sure that he finds his footing as a sober adult in 2024 (the world has changed since he was 20 and he is not that young anymore). I have 2 daughters and do not believe he is a threat to children, but others seem concerned.

3. Started a C Corp. cost me about $200 plus California annual fees ($800). Some suggest an LLC. I prefer a C Corp that’s converted to an S Corp (taxes). You don’t need this to get started. You can consult as a 1099 also.
4. Consult via that C Corp to other corporations. I focus mostly on tech companies between $25M - 100M in revenues. 

I am an employee of that corporation, not the corporation who is hiring me. I use a payroll company who files all the appropriate state and federal taxes so I have an actual w2 and paystub to show my po.

There can be multiple reasons for his actions. Typically, these guys have intimacy disorders and are emotionally unhealthy. They choose minors, in person or online, because they struggle to open up and relate to adults. Or they're stuck developmentally and the wounded child inside them sought out another child. It's very complex. Let him go on his journey of discovering why. Sometimes its not pretty! If he comes out still blaming everyone else for his actions, leave him. 

But this is not your fault.

Here are a few common dynamics. They're undoubtedly more and some people probably experience a combination of: 

1) They are attracted to minors and offend to act out their sexual preference.  Some are exclusively attracted to minors, others have healthy adult attractions as well.

2) They are porn addicts who gradually expanded their attraction profile in a way that makes CSAM acceptable to them.  Some are minor attracted and pornography users.

3) Some, abused as children, compulsively reenact what was done to them.  

4) For others SA is an act of power / and or dominance.  The behavior satisfied some deep maladapted psychological need...

Part of it is men talking about feelings 🤢🤮. Yeah, we know, we suck at that. Part of that talking about feelings has to do with how we got into a mental state where we thought it was OK to victimize others (minors in most cases). Naturally in those discussions we bring up those closest to us at the time and any failings those relationships were having. 

What we absolutely DO NOT do in SOTP is blame others, especially significant others, for our decisions. There's a sign on the wall where mine is held that says ""Own your shit."" And that's serious. If you can't take responsibility over your actions, you're not compliant with the program. If you're not compliant with the program, your PO will know about it and be on your ass. If you repeatedly blame others and are non-compliant, a SOTP has every right to kick you out. If you get kicked out of a judge-ordered treatment program, guess where you're going... It's that serious.

m3ujnbp,comment,,Sounds like yours maybe similar to my experience in the sense I'm picking up maybe it was more along the lines of 3rd degree where age was not of consent but a relation was formed? Way it was explained to me by a psychologist was that the feeling of inferior and not being enough to a strong women makes then feel less then and when they find a 15 year old who gives them that attention amd sees them as strong and not weak and not full of the flaws we as strong women see they fall into that trap. I think there's a line between child porn and pedophiles and 3rd degree statutory situations where say 2 more months the person would of been of legal age.. however there is still not a healthy brain making those decisions and therapy is definitely needed to make that man a man and reinforce that he is a man so he does not seek that reinforce in inappropriate unhealthy ways. I know drugs can blur lines a lot and in my case it played an active roll I'm my husband's irresponsible choices. However he took responsibility attended a year long inpatient CD program and we have been doing couples therapy for almost a year and solo therapy for both of us to begin to repair what the affair caused. It brought to light a history of sexual abuse as a child from his sister and really opened the door for his healing to begin.

He’s a grown ass adult. If he needed more of something from you he has the ability to open his mouth and say it, write it down, or send it in an email. Normal human beings do not say, “you know what, my wife doesn’t compliment me enough, I’m going to mess around with a kid so I’ll feel better.” 

No, no, no, that doesn’t happen. 

Even if he DID voice those things to you and you flat out refused to do them you would STILL not be responsible, IN ANY WAY, for him sexually assaulting a minor. If you treated him like absolute dirt you would STILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS CHOICE TO SA A MINOR. 

This was not a “therapy sesh” they had. It was an excuse filled whine-fest. 

People are responsible for THEIR OWN self worth. Can other people make you feel good about yourself? Sure they can, but that’s not what self worth is. Self worth is knowing that you are worthy of love and respect and not tolerating less than that. People can sometimes destroy your self worth, if you let them,  but that still doesn’t cause people to commit crimes. You need to find your self worth again, because you are worthy of so much more than someone trying to manipulate you in to believing you caused them to SA a minor.

m3u4ths,comment,,"“How do we lift them so they don’t need to act like that?”

Perhaps that’s not how you meant it, but it certainly comes across to me as “we aren’t being nice enough to them so they assault people.” 

What studies show men are spiraling? I’ve read studies showing that men are lonelier, but people in general are more lonely. We put more effort in to internet strangers than we do in making real life friends. 

However, the crumbling patriarchy has been great for most men. Studies show that the disappearing image that men have to be perpetually strong, not show emotion, not ask for help, not talk about emotional struggles, etc… has done a world of good for men and enabled them to be able to speak up about how they feel, seek help, be vulnerable, etc… 

A very specific type of men, who have a need for control, often seem to be spiraling. Overall, however, studies show that the deterioration of patriarchy has unequivocally made women safer and has had an extremely positive effect on the vast majority of men.

According to VAWA, annual rates of domestic violence dropped by 67% between 1993 and 2022. Rapes and sexual assaults declined by 56%. 

We are significantly safer than we were 30 years ago. 

Men are able to speak up about their own abuse and get help for that. Enormous strides (the Catholic Church, the Baptist Church, the Boy Scouts of America, etc…) have been made to protect boys from sexual assault and help the men who experienced that abuse - something that for generations was ignored or locked away because it made them “less of a man.”

The crime rate is going down, not up. Do we still need to work on it? Absolutely, of course we do, but the world is getting safer, not more dangerous.",5,,2024-12-26 05:17:40,t1_m3tzx5j,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1hm9bap/confused_wife/m3u4ths/

m3rw73k,comment,,"I’m not a lawyer but reading through the O.C.G.A. § 42-1-12 statutes, it doesn’t seem to specify that you can avoid registration if the state you’re moving *from* did not require it. It’s specifies that you must register if *any* state requires you to register. I didn’t see any notes at the end reflecting that this has specifically been challenged in court for clarification but it’s possible that it has been. I would make sure that you’re talking to an attorney in Georgia that has extensive knowledge regarding registration requirements and any precedent set via challenges in court. 

But as a reminder, you probably know this but for the sake of saying it for anyone else reading - there’s really no guarantee for anybody in any state that they will not ever have to register. Registration requirements are viewed as regulatory (specifically stated as such in the Georgia statutes) so they can and do change frequently in various states. Obviously, there are some states that have shown consistent, rational approaches to the registry and certain lenience. But as absurd as it sounds, there’s really no firm guarantee for anybody no matter where they move.

I believe you have to submit all of your paperwork when moving here if you’ve been removed from the registry elsewhere and are trying to circumvent having to register here, then they make a determination. I do not know the intricacies of how it works exactly, but I have read a dozen or so court cases where people petitioned for relief from having to register here upon moving. The results were pretty mixed. People adjucated as Juveniles were typically not made to register while people who committed hands on or “more serious” internet crimes were. I believe there were a couple of adults with very old crimes who were, themselves, very old, who didn’t have to register. 

But, a dozen cases is a drop in the bucket and doesn’t really mean anything overall.

You can’t see the discovery from those cases, you can’t get all of the details, you generally won’t know the details of that crime - how they obtained the material, where they obtained it, if they asked for specific things, if they paid for it, etc… sometimes you can see that information online but typically it isn’t available in state cases. Obviously that depends on the state and the county though. 

Can you see their risk assessments? Do you know their full history? (Not necessarily their criminal history, a lot of factors come in to play). 

Do you know how extreme the material he possessed was? And, not from his mouth - from the factual evidence. Most people minimize to family, spouses, etc… out of embarrassment and fear.

Different prosecutors, different judges, etc… give vastly different offers and sentences. It’s never going to be a one size fits all. 

You can’t read them all day long, I’ve read every single similar available case in the county my guy was prosecuted in. While it seems like there’s no rhyme or reason to it, there is so much we don’t know and can’t see.

m3gpb6z,comment,,"This type of crime has a factor that is often under looked. For every child in these photos or videos have had their life ruined, their body brutalized, and more. The sentences for these crimes may seem unjust, but the State factors in that the defendant seeks children for sexual desires. Millions of people observe pornography in the United States, but how many willingly seek out children? Some of these people that create the content charge for their products, so the defendant willingly pays for these images and videos. 

When talking about reoffending, the State also looks at the number of images/videos and how many times, many times years of viewing the material. While a DUI has a single incident, how long have some people been downloading and sharing the material? Some of these children are murdered after the material is created. 

This isn't meant to demean your situation, but I am in a similar position and wish to enter law school or obtain an MBA after my bachelors. I wish to help people after their sentences are completed to have a fulfilling life. But I do not wish to help someone who has a pathological abnormality.

Ultimately we get the government we deserve and have voted for. As long as we keep voting for “tough on crime” candidates, this trend will continue. The other unfortunate part is a lot of these prison systems are being privatized.

Basically, the prosecutor will come in high to try to scare you into accepting the deal. They may even tell you that if you go to trial, they will try to go for the maximum sentence. 

Your attorney should have all of the discovery files and should know exactly what evidence (or lack thereof) the prosecution has in order to call their bluff.

This is actually why there are varying punishments with these types of cases. The other being that the attorney could have a good relationship with the prosecution or judge on the case which can help the defendant.

m3loaic,comment,,"You seem like an intelligent woman, he is blessed to have you on his side. Let me add some clarity here.  minimum mandatories and sentencing guidleines for CSAM cases are incredibly skewed to be one of the harshest penalties for the crime commited. In fact, many cases exist where the actual abuser received less time than the one who viewed it. This happens at the legislative level of all governenment. What an easy win for the voters for a politician to stand up ""for the children"". Here in Florida our congresswoman literally presented a federal bill in congress for the death penalty for CSAM. That type of thinking is insane.

There is little remorse or care for a defendant in this type of case by law enforcement, judges, prosecutors, etc...  
God forbid you have to go to jury trial, they already have condemned you to guilt before anyone even speaks in the courtroom. Almost everyone has had a touchpoint with SA either in the first person or vicitm relationships, and that bias immediately manifests in the defendant presented as ""they must be guilty"" mentality. Also, CSAM is a slam dunk with evidetiary content, so plea deals are almost the only option avaialble. Prosecutors know this, and can pick and choose based on their criteria for punishment. Gender, race, defendants likability, grossness of lewd photos viewed, politics, all play into their decision on level of punishment as they literally have a blank canvas to incarcerate b/c who could go to trial? Nobody. And they crush you with this advantage.

Being a defense attorney in this type of case is literally deciding which part of the house will burn down, not putting the fire out. Most defendants are upstanding citizens and first time offenders, and suddenly faced with years of prison time. This is shocking, terrifying, and makes some lawyers spend half their time as therapists helping their defendant and family cope. You have been eaten by the law enforcement, prison industrial complex, and I fear their is no way out at this point. I am sorry for you and your family. Yes, it was wrong to view, but the punishment does not fit the crime at all in my opinion.

And while I understand that some people who plead not guilty actually *are* guilty, not *all* are. But it seems like the justice system layers on an additional penalty for people who don't 'take accountability' for their crimes ... even when there is *possibly* no reason to do so.

m3hlr6c,comment,,"You need to get someone who is licensed for the Abel Assesment. That individual is the expert witness, not another individual who did not provide the examinations. It's expensive in private practice, but your partner may need more than one expert psychological expert to testify. Trial testimony is different than sentencing testimony, as the trial phase is over when the sentencing phase starts. Some testimony may be irrelevant to the trial, but it is important during sentencing. 

One only needs a masters degree, not necessarily a PhD for the Abel Assesment. 

Also, seeing a psychologist can also aid in determining any disorders your partner may have. Honestly, in my experience, people with disorders are frowned upon. Therapy can get to the root of what caused this to occur.

The original crime has already been perpetrated by someone else, the secondary crime of sending it to the Internet by someone else as well. The tertiary crime of viewing the material is indeed very far removed from the original and only harmful to the extent that the original victim is aware of it. So giving sentences for simple possession in the decades of years, even more than hands on offenders, makes no logical sense.

It's obviously a violation of the original victim's rights, it's illegal, it should be punished, but what OP is saying about disproportionate sentences that vastly outweigh the harm done is correct.

m3ejh05,comment,,"I just always left that question blank on the application, the ""have you ever been convicted of a felony?"" one.  I figure, if it's an issue they'll bring it up or deny me right away.  And if it comes up later and they use it to kick me out, they wouldn't have let me in in the first place anyway.

I was tier 1 when I got my apartment back in 2018 (was in a halfway house after 5 years prison) and that worked fine.  After a year or so I was bumped up to tier 2 (most people in NV got bumped up) though, so not sure if that would've been an issue.

I found a good apartment in a \~bad part of town.  They only asked for 2x rent in income, as opposed to 3x that most places did.  I still got very lucky though.  It was quiet and had little to no crime.  The only thing we had to deal with was homeless people going through our dumpsters, and even then that was only once a week or so.

So I'd suggest that, look for the worst apartments in the bad parts of town (homeless better than drugs or crime) and then go a block or few away.  Also, can check the website of registered SOs and see where they're living, those places will obviously be willing to rent to SOs.  You can't really contact them and ask, but you CAN ask your PO if you have one.

m3eghdl,comment,,"Your first paragraph is largely inaccurate and misleading, especially in regards to OPs question and follow up. 

A person relieved of their obligation to register in one state doesn't release them of possible obligations in other states, even if they are just traveling though it. Rather than speaking on generalities, specifics are needed to make this point more understandable. As such and for example, person relieved of their duty of register in their home state is taking a RV cross country trip, so they driving from Mobile, Alabama to Key West,  Flordia and then up to Savanah, Georgia in this particular ""segment"". That's at least a 25 hour drive non stop. That doesnt factor in breaks, rest stop, traffic etc., so it's likely they would be in Florida for the amount of time that works trigger the requirement to register. If they got pulled over for speeding, and depending on what they person admitts to the officer, they could be subjected to criminal charges for failure to register.  ""Yes officer I'm just driving through on a trip.... but I've been in Flordia for 4 days taking in the sites."" Welp, that person committed failure to register. 

I make this example extreme on purpose but it's true everywhere else when you meet the registration requirements for whatever state you are in. 

The wording of their termination of registration, and circumstances behind the conviction, offense, etc. can change everything. As always in all legal situations, the answer is, ""It depends.""

So depending on the circumstances and situation, a police officer could still hold a person to registry requirements in a different state even if they had their home registration terminated, if that person has met the requirements of the ""new state"" to register. 

Also, the registry doesn't prohibit travel, especially within the US as implied in your first sentence . There is no prohibition of a registered person or formerly registered person from visiting another state. Individuals on supervision might be prohibited from travel, but that's different. And, foreign nations may prohibit a person for entering due to a criminal conviction and/or registration status, and when a registered person visits another state they may have limited ability to go to certain areas like parks or museums, but traveling in and amongst itself isn't prohibited solely by being on a registry.",3,,2024-12-23 06:13:17,t1_m3d8h7y,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1hka6i3/interstate_travel_off_the_registry/m3eghdl/

If a person is relieved of the requirement to register in one state, but travels to another, they may be required to register and abide by registry requirements, even while traveling. And while these statutes don't explicitly prohibit travel in the way that some nations prohibit entry by RSOs, it does make the need for education and study of possible restrictions ""prohibitive"" for the average person.",1,,2024-12-23 06:26:37,t1_m3eghdl,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1hka6i3/interstate_travel_off_the_registry/m3eht6q/
m3ekch4,comment,,"Again, your first paragraph is in accurate. If a person has been relieved in their home state that releases them in that state only. If that person goes to another states and meets that states requirements to register, they must comply. The requirement to register is not only based on the obligation in another state, it's based on a conviction. Being relieved of registration doesn't erase the conviction (and expungeda nd/or deferred cases are even more complicated so there is no fruit in discussing them generally).

 Another example, you are relieved of registration in a state for a possession of csam case. Then you come to CA and stay in a one  county for more than 5 business days, you are required under CA law to register in CA. CA Law matters, no the home state law.

Using the term of travel prohibitions because of the registry is not true and inaccurate. People are prohibited for entering countries for a multitude of reasons beyond being a rso.",1,,2024-12-23 06:52:40,t1_m3eht6q,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1hka6i3/interstate_travel_off_the_registry/m3ekch4/

m3ioh4q,comment,,"You commented to an orginial post about traveling to and through after being relieved from the duty to register from a home state. You replied to the OP saying the ""registry requirements will follow you for life."" To say, and I quote, ""...they aren't legally permitted to enforce registry provisions if you are no longer required to register"" is misleading in the context of the post. The context of the orginial question is in terms of traveling through and to another state. As we both have said in the context of going to and through another state, you can be still bound to their registry requirements even after being relieved of registration. To say that a police officer cannot enforce registry requirements on a person who is not in the state in which they are relieved of, is wrong. They can! So, again, your orginial statement that they cannot hold prior registration against someone in a traffic stop when in a new state is misleading in the context of the post. In their home state it's true, but what not what this is all about. 

Your second response to me is in conflict of your first statement and why I felt the need to emphasize my first statement. 

There is no way you can say that a police officer is not allowed to enforce registry requirements on a person means that a person could still be required to register when traveling or moving after being relieved. Those two statements by you are in direct conflict of each other. 

As explained, the registry requirement can be held against you for life when going to another state, and you meet their requirements for registration. It can even be held against you in international travel.

A person relieved of their duty of register must still travel as if they are still required to register, in that proper research must be done to avoid further problems. 

You can disagree about ""my opinion"" all you want about the designation and difference between properly defining travel prohibitions, denial of entry, and so on, but it seriously matters. Properly educating people is what matters, not misleading them by saying they are prohibited from traveling.  They are not prohibited from traveling.

 Its not my opinion, its fact and a matter of legal definitions. Traveling is simply going somewhere. You can go to the places. You are not going to be arrested for flying into their airports or driving to their borders. If it was prohibited, you would be breaking the law by simply going there. To be denied entry is entirely different than being against the law from going to a place. 

For example, I am free to get on a plane and travel to the Philippines, Japan, the UK, and so on. They don't have to let me in the country door, just like I am free to drive to a convenience store bare chested and barefoot, and they can refuse me entry to the store because of their store policy of ""no shirt, no shoes, no service."" If I was prohibited from traveling to the convenience store, I would be arrested for simply going there. It's the same concept. Just like if I was prohibited from traveling to those countries they would arrest me the second I got to their country. They don't, they just say you are not welcome here and send you back home.",1,,2024-12-24 00:12:56,t1_m3fvxk9,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1hka6i3/interstate_travel_off_the_registry/m3ioh4q/

So I hope this gives you hope those are the two locations that you can potentially try to spend time with your girlfriend Nepal and Europe specifically Germany Greece Italy most of Europe would not have an issue.,3,,2024-12-22 12:59:55,t3_1hjud7t,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1hjud7t/traveling_to_asia/m39zkwx/

m38mcte,comment,,It's always a great idea to retain an attorney in any situation and especially in these type of situations. I know there are mandatory minimums but there might be mitigating factors and things that only an attorney would know. Seeking therapy is a good thing to do not only because it looks good in court however it would also help you because you'll be talking to people with the same issues as you have. Perhaps you can gain some insight as to how other people are dealing with situations and so on. Regarding your friends like the op  said they will find out one way or another perhaps it's best to tell them they may be some sort of support for you. If not they would left you anyway so it doesn't really matter. If they're going to stick by you it's best you tell them now so you may have some support like I said earlier if they won't stick by you it doesn't matter whether you tell them now or later they just won't stick by you. There's only one way to find out by telling them. Your mental health issues may be mitigating factors I'm not an attorney and I cannot give you legal advice. And I'm not familiar with the federal system however there's a certain mens rea required in order for you to fit the criteria of the statue. If you lack that mens rea it may be a negotiating tool for you. Once again that's something you have to ask your attorney. You're very fortunate to have family that retained an attorney and your behalf be grateful for that.,3,,2024-12-22 04:09:11,t3_1hjouzk,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1hjouzk/therapysotp/m38mcte/
m387bej,comment,,"This has been covered a couple times in other posts but I’ll summarize.  

A personal lawyer versus a public defender is always a tossup. If you’re paying 30,000 for a private lawyer, it’s probably likely that you would not qualify for a public defender anyway. Now there could be family money issues with that. For me, I hired an attorney and it was helpful to have somebody I could call at a moments notice. I don’t think it changed the outcome.

Getting into SOTP treatment is a good step for you and your recovery. While it looks good to others. It realistically won’t have an outcome on sentencing especially in a federal case with minimums. The advantage is it gives you a group of people to talk to with relevant experience and who have gone through this process before you.

Therapist are mandatory reporters, but a good program will give you guidelines on what you can talk about and what you should leave to discuss with your lawyer.

At some point, you’re gonna have to talk to your friends. It’s going to be better coming from you and finding out about it in the paper or after a conviction. I opened up to too close friends about a month after the search. They were both extremely supportive During the investigation and trial process. No one can promise that your friends will be. But at some point they’re gonna find out.",2,,2024-12-22 02:15:39,t3_1hjouzk,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1hjouzk/therapysotp/m387bej/

m3cp90v,comment,,"Shop around and find lawyers that will work for a flat fee/retainer.  When i was raided I called \~4-5 lawyers that day.  The first few all charged like $200-300/hour and I couldn't afford that.  But the last one said they'd do it for \~7k.  I forget the exact # because my mom mostly paid it.  I was also in my early/mid 20s.  They let me pay in monthly installments too so that helped a lot.  And in the end they waived the last 1k or so.  Though, my best friend is a lawyer so maybe we were on retainer the whole time and they were just giving us back the $$ that wasn't used?

If you do go with a big $$ lawyer, I'd ask them for other cases they've worked on (or seen at least) with similar charges and people and what the outcomes were.

It’s time to get out of town and go where there is more opportunity. You’re basically sitting there waiting for the inevitable. What will you do when the $2000 runs out? You likely may end up homeless wherever you go, but at least there will be opportunity.

m37qsd4,comment,,"You will always feel underrated in your capacity of skill set. That comes with the territory of being an RSO. A lot of universities will likely not want you taking classes on campus grounds as they see you as a higher risk liability.

(IMO) If I were you. I'd make an effort to take online classes, join clubs if able too, and get a library card from the university.  Make yourself known. Get your foot in the door to show the administration that you are not a threat. Make it known to the university your effort to apply for your desired degree. With a little luck and alot of effort, your chances of getting what you want can turn to your favor.

Yes, a sex offender can attend the University of Arizona, but the enrollment process may be different from other students. The level of the offender’s offense determines whether they need to notify the university of their status: 
Level one: Lowest risk, and typically does not require community notification 
Level two: Intermediate risk, and requires notification if the offender attends school in any way 
Level 3: High risk, and requires notification if the offender attends school in any way, including those who live off campus 
The University of Arizona Police Department (UAPD) notifies the campus community about registered sex offenders. The UAPD also issues exclusionary orders for a minimum of six months and up to a year. These orders can be requested by university officials or initiated by a UAPD officer. 
In Arizona, sex offenders must: 
Register with the sheriff of the county they reside in within 72 hours of release or moving to a new location 
Notify the sheriff of any changes in enrollment or employment status 
Keep their registration updated with any home or business addresses",2,,2024-12-22 01:10:08,t1_m37wx8e,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1hjmjg7/where_can_i_go_to_school/m37xvpc/

m3kgdyp,comment,,"No. Feelings of isolation and loneliness did not lead to the offense.

You’re responsible for your emotions. You’re responsible for redirecting your emotions. You’re responsible for your coping skills.

You never have to act on your emotions. You can just feel them without acting.

Engineering is hard and it’s going to trigger stress. If you already know you can’t handle an online program because it’ll trigger stress, maybe you should work on stress management before doing any of this.

By the way, I had years of in person college and was *severely* isolated and lonely. It’s actually worse when you’re around people. Because there’s so many people around you, and yet they choose to isolate you. At least when you’re not around people, you don’t have to deal with rejection.

As for isolation and loneliness during an online program… surely you can find other ways to socialize. Get a part-time job, volunteer… as an engineer you need to be creative and problem solve.

m3mcwg2,comment,,"Isolation and loneliness were not the only factors, but they did contribute.  In my treatment program, loneliness and isolation were literally one of the 12 risk factors, and were identified as a treatment need for me.  In fact, a strong social support system is one of the best protective factors you could have.  It's not necessary, but certianly helps.  
  
I over the past years, I have worked on my social skills and have found that being with people helps me cope with other stressors in more helpful ways.  Loneliness and isolation did not cause the offense, but they did trigger the feelings that I didn't have the coping skills to deal with.  It's good and important to be able to live in such negative feelings and not make poor choices.  It's better if you can minimize those feelings in the first place, though cultivating your personal life to one that leaves you feeling fulfilled.

I recognize that I will feel negative emotions and it is my responsibility to handle them appropriately, rather than resorting to harmful behaviors.  Increasing my social contact with others is the way I am choosing to handle those emotions, in addition to personal emotional management.  There is never just one thing that causes an offense.  It is usually many factors, and it is good to address as many of them as possible to reduce risk of re-offense

I would be careful with trying to diagnose others over the internet.  You may know your own situation, but you do not know others.  What may not be significant to you may be significant to the person you are writing to.  I would encourage you try to understand others more before giving them a prescription.

I am not attending school because I feel it is necessary to prevent myself from reoffending.  I am attending school because it opens up a career path that I want to pursue.  I want to attend in person because I want to cultivate connections with others in the program.  I could get by without, but it is a path I would like to walk.",1,,2024-12-24 17:31:36,t1_m3kgdyp,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1hjmjg7/where_can_i_go_to_school/m3mcwg2/

If it IS possible, what would it take to make that happen in the US? ""Permission from the court to move"" ....using which state? NJ or NC (where my son will be released to). I know people who have moved to Germany (my son's birthplace and having lived there 2yrs, but he's not a citizen) successfully but they have completed their probation. I know of no one who was on lifetime probation, went to court to have it removed, and then moved to another country. Are you saying you know people who have?  He also has an NJ civil judgement against him. Do other countries pay attention to that? I know this would be an uphill battle, but that will be equally true here in the US with very little long term return given it's current state of dysfunction. No, if my son is to have a future worth living it will be outside of the US.  That much I am sure of.

These are really attorney questions because there are so many factors involved. 

People have moved to Germany, but typically after finishing their sentence. Lifetime probation means there’s no end to the sentence. 

I know of one person who moved out of the country while on probation, not to Germany, and I think they have dual citizenship. Most countries will not issue a visa or residency permit to someone who is still serving a sentence, especially if their crime was serious enough to warrant lifetime probation. 

When I say that most countries wouldn’t issue a visa, I don’t actually know of a single one that would - but that doesn’t mean one doesn’t exist or that it’s true in every circumstance. 

I’d speak to a US Federal attorney about the chance of him being able to move and a German immigration attorney about the chance they’ll issue him a visa.

m39bbqv,comment,,"You need to learn to Google. Even with Google being shit to how it used to be, you can get basic information queries of straight facts answered. For example, 

German citizenship through birth on German territory

A child born in Germany on or after 1 January 2000 to non-German parents may acquire German citizenship under certain conditions:

At least one of the foreign parents must have been permanently resident in Germany for at least eight years (if the child is born after 26.06.2024: five years) and – for children born on or after 28 August 2007 – the parent must also possess indefinite leave to remain in Germany.

Children born to foreign parents in Germany before 1 January 2000 did not acquire German citizenship and cannot retroactively apply for citizenship.
Acquisition of German citizenship by declaration

The Fourth Act Amending the Nationality Act, which entered into force on 20 August 2021, has created a ten-year right of declaration (Section 5 of the Nationality Act). It grants children born to a German parent after 23 May 1949 (entry into force of the Basic Law) who, under the version of the Reich and Nationality Act valid at the time of their birth, were excluded in a gender-discriminating manner from acquiring German citizenship by descent at birth have the option of obtaining German citizenship by making a simple declaration to the competent citizenship authority. The option of acquisition by declaration also applies to their descendants.

The group of persons affected includes

    children born after 23 May 1949 to a German parent who did not acquire German nationality by birth (children born in wedlock prior to 1 January 1975 to a German mother and a foreign father or children born out of wedlock prior to 1 July 1993 to a German father and a foreign mother),
    children born after 23 May 1949 to a mother who lost her German citizenship through marriage to a foreigner pursuant to Section 17 (6) of the Reich and Nationality Act (old version) before the birth of the child prior to 1 April 1953,
    children born after 23 May 1949 who lost their German nationality acquired by birth through legitimisation effected by a foreigner and valid under German law pursuant to Section 17 (5) of the Reich and Nationality Act (old version) prior to 1 April 1953, and
    descendants of the children in paragraphs 1 to 3.

You can’t live within 1000 feet of any childcare facility, school, church, community swimming pool, park, playground, recreation center, neighborhood center, gymnasium, skating rink, public library, or school bus stop. - the school bus stops have to be designated by the county for it to apply, only a couple of counties have actually done it. 

You can’t work within 1000 feet of a childcare facility, school, or church.

There are churches *everywhere*. When my guy was paroled, he spent almost an extra year incarcerated because his parents couldn’t find a place for him to live and it was an absolute shithole. Then it took almost a year for me to find a house to purchase that met all the parameters.

Everyone is in the same boat and that is the most common conviction too shockingly.",2,,2024-12-20 10:22:52,t3_1hi9it5,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1hi9it5/boyfriend_got_blindsided_at_court_and_sent_to/m2yoszz/

UK prisons are nothing like US and he’ll be fine once there.
As for his sentence length sometimes it’s juts bad luck.
A lad I was in with was sentenced to 3 years juts for pinching a girls bum in a nightclub

Was at the time of the Jimmy saville outrage and sentences went very harsh.

Obviously you know that it will be almost impossible for him to travel to the US

If he knows your phone number someone from the prison will call you and ask if it’s ok for him to add you to approved numbers 

Although I hate to think what the calling cost will be for him..

If it makes any difference, he’s in England (noticed you were from Scotland). I am in contact with his mother, sister, and probation officer who have all echoed the same thing.

m2xg2cv,comment,,"OK after 35 I think the next time points are lowered for age is at 55 but not 100percent on that. He may do alot of time in a medium which is not a bad thing once he gets somewhere safe. I actually liked the mediums more than lows. Most lows are dorms just filled with beds so there is no privacy and if a riot or something happens SOS are vulnerable. In the mediums it's cells so as long as he has a good celly he will be OK and be able to sleep because they lock U in the cell at night. I went through a lot of bs while locked up which made me learn how to fight back the right way without getting in trouble. The staff will try to lie and do what ever they want if U let them. They try and do alot of things they can't and if he knows what to do it will Def help him. If you ever need to know anything you can ask me. I'm pretty knowledgeable about all of this. But for now he needs to deny Gen pop one more time and get another shot., and then he will be able to get transfered. Usually when someone is transfered for refusing the yard they will be sent somewhere safe. I started at a low and got into fight with a guard and got transfered on a disciplinary so they sent me to Leavenworth. After my 6months there I transfered to Williamsburg medium in SC. And did 2years there and my points dropped back down to a low and I was transferred to a low in MN. He is ""safe"" at pretty much any low he goes to. Mediums are far and few between but there are some and there is only 1usp he can walk in az. Hopefully he drops to a low soon.

When he gets to a safe yard his points need to get to below a 15and he will be low and they will transfer him. How old is he? If he is under 25 points will drop at 25 and again at 35. Doing classes only help certain people. If he has an internet crime as cp, he don't qualify. Staying out of trouble will be the best bet.

m2xooz6,comment,,"His friend came over with four kids to have them get ready at his house before school and he had cameras in the rooms that children usually change clothes in (bathrooms and bedrooms)? His house got robbed but the robber knew his ex-wife and outed himself as the robber just to give the SD card to the ex-wife? The math doesn’t math there. And the thing is, we don’t judge no matter what the story is. But when we think a partner may be being lied to, we mention it. So respectfully, I can’t imagine how that story could possibly be true. 

His friend, a buddy, so it sounds like a man - that dad would’ve had to pack all the stuff for four kids to get dressed and ready for school and take his kids to a friend’s house where that friend was a meth addict and then the kids would’ve had to be changing clothes in view of cameras which would mean there would’ve needed to be a lot of cameras in private rooms which is - well - not normal. 

And then even if we give the robber part the benefit of the doubt (although that part is equally as wild), the federal government being involved would be confusing given that this was a state crime and the federal government can’t force a state to charge someone with a crime. 

And even if we got past all that, whomever prosecuted would’ve had to decide and then act on the idea that one SD card with nothing but one instance of children innocently changing clothes, and assuming absolutely nothing was found on any other device he owned, and assuming it was true that the SD card had never been viewed, that prosecutor would’ve had to look at all that and say “yep, this dude definitely knowingly and purposely recorded nude children for pornographic purposes.” 

I come from a place of compassion and kindness. But please know that story is almost assuredly not true. And that’s okay. Most folks arrested for these crimes don’t provide the true story right away. It can take time to feel ready to tell the truth. But all that means is you get to decide whether or not you want to ask for the truth, whether or not you want to be with him if that’s not the truth, etc. We’re here to offer support and community either way.",6,,2024-12-20 04:13:38,t1_m2xh6hi,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1hi2aus/leavenworth/m2xooz6/

m2yrsww,comment,,"I’m just playing devils advocate here but I can see the state turning down the case because since the sd card was stolen I believe it becomes fruit of the forbidden tree and any good defense attorney would get it suppressed and if that’s all the evidence there is no case

The feds more than likely would of did the same but they have more resources than the rest of the world combined so they’ll find away around it

I don’t believe the story either.. sounds like he put the cameras there to see the kids naked while he was on meth due to the hypersexuality and loss of impulse control.. maybe he sobered up and was like “wtf am I doing?” And took them down and put them away for a “rainy day” just in case he ever was methed out again and couldn’t get off.

m2vsisj,comment,,"Elkton is an FSL designed and run somewhere between a low and a medium. There is an adjacent Low down the hill where the SOMP is located. If he is eligible for the RDAP program, I strongly recommend he take that, rather than SOMP. RDAP is located at the main facility. The library, food and rec opportunities are better than down the hill. Very little ""politics"", people mostly stayed to themselves or in their crew, without much interaction. The RDAP program does not tolerate enmity between inmates, instigators get kicked out and lose their shot at getting a year off.

Elkton is in the countryside, it's quite nice outside the fences and wildlife can often be spotted. Trust me, every little different thing means a lot, in prison. It's overcrowded but so are all other prisons. Typically 3 men in cubes, dormitory style. It gets noisy.

Active sports leagues, decent walking/running track. Don't get me wrong, it's still prison but there worse places to be.

Like you, I was glad to be out, but I was only then starting my 6 years fed supervised release in a state I wasn't from and knew no one. 

My time in prison was the most social I'd ever been, and there was a depression of sorts because of that sudden loss of any social interaction.

My family and friends, whom I hadn't spoken to in 8 years, were all very supportive, but they had moved on (and were all in different states). 
I compare it to that movie Flight of the Navigator where the kid returns after 10 or something years, and everything around him has changed.

m2vpf7l,comment,,"Talked to a therapist?  There's a difference between being sad/depressed, and having depression.  My friend has depression (not an SO) and it doesn't matter if he has it good/easy in life (he does), he'll get super depressed about stuff that makes no sense.  Like...he has no $$ issues, got a full ride through law school, but will get super upset if a case he's working on has a small setback.  Have to go lie down and doesn't want to talk to anyone all day.

I think clinical depression is something more to be diagnosed and possibly medicated.  But that means it can be a hormonal imbalance or something that CAN be treated.  It's a gigantic difference when my friend takes his meds vs not taking them.

If it's not that, and you're just feeling depressed even though you think you shouldn't be, uh...well that sounds like half the solution right there.  You realize something isn't syncing up right, so maybe focus on the good stuff and try extra hard to remind yourself that a lot of stuff is going well in your life.

I've never had either of those issues so I'm just guessing here lol, and speaking from experience with friends w/ depression that never seems to make sense to me.  I did 5 years for receipt of CP but feel like my life has been pretty good since then (as good as it can be while dealing with supervision and stuff).  I had my own apartment from \~2018-2023, worked in a few restaurants, and was making good $$.  

When I quit my job I had like 5k saved up, which isn't a TON but is a lot when you're used to living paycheck to paycheck.  I moved in w/ friends and quit my job to focus on writing a book, so it was totally my choice.  And the last year and change have been pretty good, especially in comparison to some of the stories I read about on here.  I find myself extremely lucky.  

I don't know if you think of yourself as the same, but just having a few people that support you is a huge thing.  Especially if they're people you can go to for $$ or a place to stay in a pinch.  Plenty of people here don't have that.  

If you're feeling unproductive, uhhh...do something lol.  Are you looking for work?  Maybe you can volunteer somewhere.  I don't know if volunteer places do background checks, but I know animal shelter type places want volunteers to go spend time with the animals.  Don't have to bring them home (though that's a thing you CAN do for a weekend or so), just go play with puppies and stuff.

On depression: yes. I'm not chronically depressed, but I've experienced *situational* depression (not just 'sadness') frequently enough in my life to recognize the symptoms. I am set up with a first appointment with a therapist, thankfully, but not until January. Therapy was always part of my plan anyway (to deal with underlying issues), but now I've got something else to discuss with them.

And yes, as far as productivity goes, I am doing things to be productive. I didn't put that much detail here because I don't tend to post potentially identifying information. I'm putting time and effort into work, but being self-employed, it takes time to build. Plus, the holidays are always a slow time, even at the best of times.

m2sclfi,comment,,"It greatly depends on his probation officer, his treatment provider (assuming he is in treatment) and the city's ordinances in which you live and are planning to travel.

  
When on probation, I was always made to create something called a safety/travel plan that noted who all I was traveling with, the means of travel, the routes of travel, the destination, who would be at the destination, how long I would be at the destination, any potential risks to adhering to probation and how those would be mitigated, the route and means of travel back to my residence.

  
If he's in good standing, there are minimal risks, and there are no other violations of his terms of probation or the cities ordinances (ie no child safety zones, no minors if applicable, etc.) then there should not be much of a problem. 

  
Again, this is all very subjective and you're essentially at the whims of the probation officer. But if you show that you've thought about all the risks and clearly shown your intentions on how to mitigate them, and you're not brand new to probation and have a good standing, I would imagine it should be granted.

  
I was in the DFW area of TX and this was pretty standard practice in our treatment group.

According to my therapy it's basically cognitive distorted thinking. We basically lie to ourselves in those situations and say ""Hey they want it."" When they really don't know wtf they are truly doing.

I'm sure it's when you keep engaging and then get overly inappropriate and pictures get sent they have you.

Your best defense is you stopped after the said their age.

I learned in Therapy one of the fellow group people had a common charge of sleeping with under age they met ""at a bar"" with fake ID and the thing I learned from those group sessions is basically you don't engage in sex unless you get to know them better, meet parents, family etc. I know it's conflict because sometimes the reason people go to bars is to meet for sexual encounters.

So in the same way, you should never ever send pics of yourself ever again. There's behaviors and habits we have to change and stop doing because it's a conflict of interests our past.

The one thing I've learned from my past is I don't like the feelings that you are currently expereicing. so I remind myself of the fear and shame that I would put myself in. 

If you are able to move on from this experience remember what you already gone through rememember this current fear and ask yourself is it worth it?

m2po8qw,comment,,"He qualifies. RDAP is about treating substance dependencies.

The way it works is you're put on a waiting list until a bed is available. He'll be admitted to the RDAP unit and will participate in community activities before he is eligible to begin the actual treatment program. This is to acclimate people to the recovery culture in prison, keeping in mind that RDAP is not associated with AA/NA.

So, available bed, he's on the unit. Available program slot, he's in the program, consistent with his projected release date. He may not get all 12 months, many people don't. Eleven seems to be about right due to administrative inefficiencies.

The good news is that RDAP does not condone poor behavior toward other inmates. People get kicked out for that. If he minds his own business, he'll have a relatively easy experience.",6,,2024-12-18 20:22:10,t3_1hhagpc,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1hhagpc/quick_rdap_question/m2po8qw/

He got assurances from the prison psychologist and his case manager that he would get 12 months off his time upon successful completion. He was successful (50% quit or are kicked out) and did get the 12 month reduction. They actually front load it: the reduction is applied and you can see the new out date on the BOP website. It is yours to lose.

After resolving any errors or inaccuracies and receiving a final decision of disqualification, a business must wait an additional 30 days to reapply for admission to the Google program. If a second application is also denied, you must wait 180 days before reapplying in all further instances of reapplication.

I asked why they were letting me go after hiring me knowing full well I was registered and she was a bitch and just said, we are an at will work state, I don't have to give you a reason.  This was a six figure job with a lot of responsibility I had been at for two years, not like I was working at Dennys or something. In retrospect I got the cold shoulder and side eye from colleagues for about 2 weeks prior. They probably found out and said they wouldn't work with me or made an issue begind the scenes. My takeaway was they were all cowards not to come to the HR call and for the corporation to not give any seperation reason. I wondered what would happen w/ unemployment interview with them but I am blessed it never happened, I got a job the next month making significantly more money, passed the Hire Right background check and they know I am registered. They follow the CA second chance rules for hiring. Going on 3 years and already been promoted. I am an executive level employee FWIW, I know there is a tremendous difference between careers and ability to thrive. Reason I point this out is even w/ our criminal background you can achieve great levels of success in an organization that you have support. You have value, just find the people or organization who understands that. I am not on probation/parole, I would imagine they sabotage a lot of opportunity either actively or passively with state requirements. I bartended at a tiki bar while I did my 1 year probation, had a gps monitor and everything, honestly it was the most fun I had in years earning money.

m2o3rtf,comment,,"I went through this scenario. Except that my original sentence explicitly allowed me contact with my own children, but the district I released to (also federal) forced me to accept new conditions of supervision with no contact with any minor including my own children. 

I talked to my children weekly while in custody. Got out earlier this year and was told nope.

I talked to my public defender to ask how to petition the court to change it back. She talked to the PO and dissuaded me, telling me to work with the PO.

So I had to start SOTP and get a few months in; complete the psycho sexual evaluation (it was almost done already); do two polygraphs; make a safety plan; and their mother had to have a session with the therapist for chaperone training. It was a lot of hoops and took about 6 months. I've recently successfully reestablished supervised visits. 

During that time the PO and treatment provider were kind enough to allow me to restart first phone calls and then video visits though so I was only totally out of contact for about a month. 

Remind yourself it's temporary, keep your eyes on the goal, and establish a track record of good behavior and choices.",3,,2024-12-18 15:24:13,t3_1hh25fl,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1hh25fl/my_children/m2o3rtf/

Just like you my husband’s crime was not against our child. It was however against children. (1 count possession only of CP). We had to petition the judge to allow contact.  He was given phone contact first then visitation, finally he could move back home with us.  Took almost three months of agony and aggravating issues.  But in the end we won where there were no restrictions when it came to our son .  It was a hard couple months and our son at the time didn’t understand .  Just know abide by their rules and work with them.  It helps things go a little easier.  Also if ordered therapy they do and will contact the provider and that seemed to help as well.

m2qcjtp,comment,,"What state are you in?  I did 5 years for receipt of CP and got out late 2017.  In the halfway house, we could have a smartphone if we got a letter from our boss that it would help with work, which everyone did.

Once I got out, I was able to have one computer/laptop and one phone, both with monitoring software that I never had to pay for.  At first, the monitoring company they used didn't work on iphones, since they were basically a virus.  But POs here let us have iphones and they'd just look through them.  We all have to take polygraphs once/twice a year anyway, so it's not like we could abuse the phones without anyone knowing.

Check your court paperwork for sentencing.  Mine leaves a lot up to the PO.  Even if you're not allowed internet devices at first, which is rare but could depend on your state, I'm sure that soon/eventually they'll let you.  My PO was a lot more strict with me for the first month or so, until I started therapy and had a sexual history polygraph.  

Was still a hard/jackass for a good 6 months at least though, then I think he realized I wasn't going to be causing him any trouble and he got a LOT better. Instead of coming to my apartment once a month and checking every room and in cabinets and stuff, he'd just stay in the entryway and have a quick 30 sec ""Work good?  Therapy going well?  Any issues?  Ok bye!"" and be off.

If for some reason you have to pay for your own monitoring, I think it's like 30/month or so.  I remember some guys in therapy that were there while on pre-trial said they paid that much.  You could always just use a flip phone for now and then once you get a job and have some $$, upgrade to a smart phone.  Double check with your PO if they say you have to pay, ask them if everyone has to pay or if only tier 1s do or something (I'm t2).

Also, in general you should get the answers to any questions you ask your PO in email or text form.  You don't want there to be any confusion/vagueness.  If ANYthing comes up you want to be able to show their boss or the court ""Here's where my PO said I could \_\_\_""  My PO's been great, and I hope I never get a new one, but I still make sure to text her for anything important.",2,,2024-12-18 22:28:25,t3_1hh22ya,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1hh22ya/rules_of_parole/m2qcjtp/

m2wpx01,comment,,"I think they don't want those that actually offended around vulnerable women and children, who are now in an even more vulnerable position, often with little to none personal resources and connections of their own.
Probably one of the biggest concerns, among many other big concerns because it's all about that vulnerability and sex offenders have the highest rates to reoffend, most don't see jail as rapists do not, and most already go after those they know and yes, especially even family.
So why would they care about strangers in shelters?

But come on, you guys have to know what the very many reasons are even if you obviously disagree..
It all out there in psychology, science, discussions everywhere, etc.
From your own crimes and the effects of those.
Let's say though, you really do think it's unfair for all these reasons, there would be too many offenders who don't give a damn and will be so happy to have access to all these victims.
There would be far, far, too many with that in mind.
And I'm sorry not sorry, but why do you guy's really care about fairness and discrimination when this particular type of sexual violence is all about especially betraying trust, and often what victims are available to the offender, whether with gender preferences or not?
Like rapists, there are many offenders who will swing to whatever was/is available to them?
And let's say it does fall through and there is assault, pregnancy, and diseases from it, what then?
This reminds me of those who called themselves transgender and have assaulted those in prison, impregnating some.
Those special situations were introduced, and whether it was sooner or later cases came.
And it kept, happening.
Why does it even the majority means what they actually say then?
It's looking at what could and would most likely go wrong at it's worst, if laws and rules can be changed in a timely enough manner to curb and stop the damage, and many more factors to consider.
All the things to be worried about women and children and I don't think this will help anyone in the vast majority of this but offenders.
Offenders are not even allowed near children in certain public areas and events, and to live with them in emergency situations is Olympic level mental gymnastics.
This comment will receive no love and most probably no consideration, and just as well for such a space and post as this.
Tone-deaf in it's perfection to put this in the nicest and closest way, if even that.

I understand how you feel, my ex-wife felt the same way. We didn't talk about until during the divorce, after I got out. I didn't blame her for the divorce, I made a terrible mistake that hurt a lot of people, but I'm not a monster.

I once had hopes that things would go back to ""normal"". It's best that I learned otherwise. I think I'm kind of rambling, here, there's a lot of strong emotions coming up, a lost of unpleasant memories.

You need to make decisions that are best for your emotional and mental health. If you have it in you to continue supporting him, please do so as long as you can. And if you cannot, please keep in mind you've been dealt a serious blow.

As far as trust goes, the loss of it is the main reason my wife opted for divorce. I understood. The divorce was amicable, we talk often these days, mainly about our children. We both have still have feelings for each other, how could we not?

m2n2svo,comment,,"Go easy on yourself around anniversaries and holidays. It definitely heightens things. 

I do think you need to be honest with him about your hurt. I know he's suffering too - but these are his choices that are causing it all. Don't bottle it up, or it'll explode one day. 
Life won't ever be ""normal"" but it can be a fulfilling and enjoyable life. I mourn the loss of our dreams of fostering kids, but our actual kids are getting better parents and a healthier home due to what we've learned and how we both communicate. We've done couples counselling and the hard yards - none of this just happens. 

You don't have to stay because you're obliged to. Stay because you can see a future that's brighter than life right now. He may not have the same job, you can't travel like others do.... but is he doing the work, attending the programs, bettering himself, being more emotionally available? Is it worth waiting for him, or is he dead weight? Only you can decide that ❤️

But have the hard conversations. So he knows the impact of this. Give him a chance to step up emotionally and actually freaking learn to have the empathy that he needs. So many of us partners and spouses struggle to be honest about our own needs!!! It's time we stop suffering in silence. He either steps up and supports you however he can right now - he's in a stable place. It sucks inside, I'm sure. But you're dealing with financial stress, household chores, the kids... he can support you too. 

Or, he doesn't. And you can make your choice.",5,,2024-12-18 10:52:16,t3_1hgprrx,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1hgprrx/1_year_tomorrow/m2n2svo/
m2my8lf,comment,,"I’m so sorry to hear of your distress and sadness. As an offender, I feel terrible about how my csam possession, arrest and imprisonment impacted my former partner. We had split up about a year before my arrest, but I know that it was a terrible blow to her.

There is something so corrosive about CSAM charges that it seems that rebuilding love relationships is almost impossible. 

It is so different from say a drug offense/addiction or alcohol addiction - or even an affair.

One other sad reality is that, even if you decided to work through this as a couple, the ramifications of parole restrictions/probation restrictions and SO Registry exposure mean a long period of external pressures on your relationship and family.

The worst part of this may be that, if it had been a drug addiction problem, the question of continuing in the relationship might be much easier to address and resolve.

As an offender, I struggle with how to move forward as a single individual who has caused so much devastation/change in my relationships with my family members and friends. I reflect on this daily, and try to improve/rebuild…… but I can’t even bring myself to contact my former partner……after 11 years…..I don’t want to reopen an old wound…..I just wish there was some way to apologize.

m3dlrbk,comment,,"Yes, help yourself first. Love yourself first. Respect yourself first. I’m afraid too for all the unknowns but I also have to do it. I just can’t stay with him knowing his selfish past. His decisions put us under this light. I don’t want to resent him anymore, I don’t want to hate him. I just want peace, healing and relearn to trust and feel safe again. 

I have forgiven him, God knows I have, but my future cannot be with him, not like this, it’s not what I planned. Not this way. Not with this guilt and shame, as if I had done something wrong, suffering consequences for actions I didn’t even commit. I’m mourning all that it could have been, all my dreams, all my plans,  and it is so painful. How can I feel strong after all this? Will I ever heal? Will I have a come back? 

I cannot see clearly now but hopefully soon I will,  so the only way I know is to take just one day at the time. Only God knows all that I did for years to save this relationship, but instead I got disappointment after disappointment, and then such a low punch when he was arrested. Porn addiction that got him in trouble. I had no idea that things were bad. I thought my marriage was fine. He was always loving and good to me. Completely blindsided. A total lack of judgment. Such lack of criteria. He made such a silly wrong decision accepting to meet with someone. And that was it. A set up. It was not even intentional. He was not looking for a minor. But he went there. Low hanging fruit. Easy prey. Everything destroyed, our future, our lives, our savings, my dreams. That’s it. Nothing left. 

Now all I have is God. I have given him everything I am. He is my Lord and Savior, he is my everything. He is the only one who can help me. Through this ordeal is how I met Jesus. I still feel for my ex, for his safety, he has a few months left, but I must release my urge to control his pain, his life, his outcome. His future is now his. And he will have to deal with all that. At some point I was even willing to sacrifice my life just for him. Who cared about how I felt? Not even I did that. The most important thing was to save him even at my own cost. I totally lost myself. I didn’t know who I was anymore. Codependency at its best. 

I’m now in the process of dealing with my own fears and my insecurities, and my lack of self worth. All things and traumas I didn’t even know were there until I had to face the nightmares when he was arrested and then sentenced. I literally died three years ago, heartbroken, and I’m still disoriented while I continue picking up my pieces. I don’t even know how I did it, how I still do it, how I will do it. And I will have to go through a divorce in the next few months, something I still struggle to accept. When he comes out, nothing will be the same.

I’m trying to feel compassion for how I feel. The scars that are left within will never go away. I know I have to embrace them, because they are there to remind me that I’m worth of real love and so much more. And if I don’t have anyone to give me pure love, at least I owe it to myself, and that should be my priority.",2,,2024-12-23 02:12:16,t1_m3ck4lz,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1hgprrx/1_year_tomorrow/m3dlrbk/

m2j37is,comment,,">I currently work in construction management. What are the odds that after this is all over I will be able to get/keep this job in construction. Is this even in the realm of reality.  
Will people know the minute I’m charged? Should I be preparing for something new?

It depends. Generally construction is considered a good place for SOs and other people convicted of crimes to find work but it really depends on the company. People will only find out, without you telling them, if you case makes it into the news

>Does everyone end up on the Canadian registry? Even though it’s now up to the judge.

I'd say it's around 90% since the change

>Is almost everyone (99%)getting jail now? Even though the mandatory has been shut down?

Pretty much. Since R. v. Friesen you need ""extenuating circumstances"" to qualify for anything less than a sentence of incarceration but your lawyer will, once they review disclosure, have a better idea of what kind of sentence you might be looking at

>Is this considered the same as a contact crime as far as the law goes? Violence against children?

Contact crime, no. Violence against children, yes

>What makes a case go to indictment vs summary? Is it just prosecution choice? For possession odds of indictment?

Entirely up to the prosecution. That being said, I know someone who was charged with possession by indictment for 32 images (category 3) so I'd say they will probably go by indictment

>Is there any chance of a normal life after conviction? What should I expect for work/housing. I’m assuming to loose all/most my friends, work colleagues.

I'll let you know if I ever get there

>Do people leave their current living situation and move cities? Is that something I should plan for? Can I be evicted?

Some people do, some people don't. I think it's mostly up to your preference. As to eviction I have no idea if you could be evicted for that. I don't think so but someone else might know better.

>I don’t see that many people in the news for these charges, are there way more cases not being reported on? I look at [Canlii.org](http://Canlii.org) and don’t see that many newer cases (I know not all make it there). Wondering what the odds of my case making it to the news.

It really just depends. On a busy news day you might not hear about even the worst of cases but on a slow news day you could hear about even the smallest case.

It gets better. It's a very slow process but it does get better. Ask for more therapy, not SOTP but for depression and anxiety. And you need to talk about those things during SOTP; you're not alone feeling those ways.

Celebrate every small achievement. Power through bad moments and situations and keep doing good things that are right for you.

They are totally different and they need to be treated in different ways. After my arrest of the compensated into a deep depression and ended up in a mental hospital. Try to do what makes you happy and I know that's like an oxymoron but try to find things that you find a little pleasure in Little things. And get your mind out of that cycle that focus is on the same thing over and over and over. Try to think of the positive things in your life such as the fact that you're free and you're not incarcerated and that you're able to cope with the whole situation with parole urine analysis treatment and such. That in and out of itself is an accomplishment and not a lot of people are able to do that and they return to prison. Command yourself for that. Perhaps you can speak to your doctor and maybe he can adjust you medication. That might be an issue also. But you got to hang in there you survived whatever the circumstances your offense were and you are able to deal with parole treatment urine analysis and the rest of it praise yourself for that and try to find something a little thing that gives you Joy.,3,,2024-12-17 15:31:23,t3_1hgchwb,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1hgchwb/burned_out/m2i8cl0/

Sure their was times when I was younger that I got comfort after praying when going to bed or before eating but I lost that connection when I grew up. Even when I was deep into my porn addiction I turned to him and begged for help and I still ended up where I am today.

m3n6tl6,comment,,"If your state allows IML 21-day notification by electronic means, that's the easiest and request your contact person to reply by email for receipt. If they don't, then call and have them check their email. I email 22days in advance. I don't need to give them 30 days although Janice Bellucci recommends that. I figure if I have a email received from the sheriff then it's on them to notify whoever they feel the need to notify. Btw, we didn't know that was even a law until I googled to see why I was pulled aside for secondary screening three consecutive international trips. I knew why they pulled me aside because of the registry but HS and Border patrol never said anything about IML. Had traveled internationally including Canada and Mexico plus Caribbean cruises for years without any problem then in 2018, the secondary screening started. Before a cruise I notified sheriffs office of intent to travel and it would include Canada. He said, ""your offense is so old and you're not on any international database, I don't need the info.""  On that cruise, all disembarking was held up an hour on the Vancouver port stop while I was located, ushered into an office,  questioned by RMCP, told I was not welcome, told to stay on the ship and cruise line took my ""card"". Then they let passengers off. When we docked in  SFO, I was full flagged, disembark line held up until security could come and clear my record with the ship. And this was an offense 40 years old

I don’t know all the laws and procedures (or even close) for every jurisdiction. This is what I know based on the southeastern states I have good knowledge of and may not apply to where you are, so it could be different where you are. 

Typically there’s no warning when there’s an indictment. They generally go to a grand jury where only the evidence from the prosecution is given and the grand jury determines if there’s enough evidence to indict the person. 

Grand jury proceedings are secret, there’s no notice or warning. It’s exceptionally unlikely that his attorney even knew it was going to happen. 

I just tried typing the timeline all out but there are so many factors I wasn’t even sure it would make sense. I googled and found a flowchart from some random county in Texas that aligns with how it works here (I’m not in Texas, I think it works this way everywhere), flowchart is [HERE](https://www.chesco.org/5183/The-Criminal-Justice-System).

m2omhr6,comment,,"Have you looked? Several states have violent felon registries and several more are considering it (considering = discussing, introducing bills, etc…) 

Regardless, people convicted of murder don’t have it easier than you do and typically spend 20 years to life incarcerated. Most lean toward the “life” end of that spectrum more than the 20 years unless they were juveniles at the time or there were extenuating circumstances. Many people convicted of murder have never killed anyone. Many have residence and work restrictions just like you do (if you’re in a state that has them) the difference being that it’s court ordered or a condition of release. 

Every state is different, but (in my experience) most people who commit murder come out of prison too old to find employment because they cannot do manual labor jobs and that’s about all that’s available to them due to a combination of their charges, their age, and their lack of job skills. 

You think it’s difficult to find a job and housing? Pretend it’s 2-3x harder than that. 

It isn’t comparable because there are too many factors at play. But, again in my personal experience, most have to live with family, if they have any left because in most cases their parents have passed away, sometimes all their siblings are gone, etc…  for the rest of their lives. Unless they were married for more than 10 years (in which case you can draw spousal benefits, but they’re rarely over $700 or $800 a month ) can’t draw social security because they haven’t paid in, they have to pay premiums (usually $125 or more per month) for Medicare because they haven’t paid in. *Some* can get SSDI if they can prove they are disabled, but that takes years and is still a very small amount of money. It’s far more complicated than that, but that’s a brief overview. 

Many to most cannot afford to live and are largely unemployable.",1,,2024-12-18 17:04:55,t1_m2o38a0,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1hf9vjr/this_is_what_i_find_weird_as_long_as_you_never/m2omhr6/

3rdly, convicted murders never even murder? You've been smoking something hard. Only ones that haven't murdered someone is one whom was framed or wrongly accused for the crime.
And finally, I do wish there was a violence registry and a drug offender registry similar to the sex offender registry! Main reason? So many things can throw one under the bus to become a sex offender including pissing in public. 
Unless you had, with intent attached to it, that could also slam you under the registry.

Many people have been convicted of murder because they were there, committing a crime, and an accomplice killed the person.

Some people get fingered for the crime and didn't commit it yes, but with other cases they get hit as an accessory which also happens.
In many cases like these, someone whom assaults someone get hits with more time than the person whom actually committed murder. Same with S.O. cases. Someone whom watched child porn got hit with more time than someone whom raped an actual child.

There are special exceptions that can be made, it requires written permission from church leaders who know the details of the crime. 

If he is on probation, he will also have to get permission from his PO and his treatment provider. 

*However* the building used by the church being a daycare further complicates the situation. If he’s on probation, discuss this with the PO. If he is not on probation, I’d contact the sheriffs office and ask if he can go. If they grant permission, get it in writing.

m2d5fv2,comment,,"Your post history, 6 posts show up, one is asking legal questions about GA. 

Your husband is, frankly, dead wrong. 

On probation or parole, people generally give up certain constitutional rights in exchange for not being incarcerated. Same goes for being out on bond. You have the option to stay incarcerated or to follow rules that may be a violation of constitutional rights. 

Your update is a little contradictory - you’re asking whether a RSO can do certain things but your update states he’s out on bond. So, is he a registered sex offender already and out on bond? Are you asking if he can go to church at present time or after conviction (if convicted) and has to register?  I just want to make sure I’m giving you the correct info! 

I doubt it’s actually constitutional to ban RSO’s from attending any church. I don’t know if it’s constitutional beyond probation or parole but I think they get around all of that by allowing it “if” certain conditions are met (like permission from the church leaders to attend).   Regardless, it’s currently the law in Georgia and I believe you’d have to take it to the GA Supreme Court in order to make that change. People have in the past, unsuccessfully, so I’m not sure that would work out well either. 

Either way, he would need permission from the court, the church admin AND parole, probation, or whomever is supervising him in order to go.",3,,2024-12-16 18:18:30,t1_m2czilf,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1hf9agx/church/m2d5fv2/

In that case the landlord might not request the background and just add you on. But I'm telling you don't do it on the down low because not only it's a violation of the lease as mentioned in another post but it would might result in an eviction for your friend and yourself. If you feel that you landlord is reasonable or if you have no other choice and you guys want to move together just tell you landlord that you want to be added to the lease agreement. Some landlords like that because now there are two people paying the rent so they are  assured that they will receive the rent. Other landlords don't like that because now they have to deal with two different tenants. So it really depends on the landlord but if you choose to remain there or attempt to remain there I would suggest you just call up the landlord and say look I got a buddy that wants to move in with me we work together and it'll be easier for us to afford the rent the landlord may increase the rent by a couple of hundred bucks or a hundred bucks because another person is living there so there's additional wear and tear and utilities use but if the landlord is reasonable they might just add you on to the lease agreement without the whole background check.

Lying on a lease application or failing to report new tenants (which is exactly what that would be considered) is nearly always grounds for eviction.  

You do not want an eviction on your or your boyfriend’s records. Take how hard it is to find housing as a RSO, multiply that by probably 10-20, and that’s how hard it will be to find housing as a RSO with an eviction.

m283c25,comment,,"I dont know about North Carolina.

But i will tell you this.

I have 18 years living as a sex offender in US.

Their are a number of things I believe you should do.  
If your new to this, then the first thing you should start doing (apart from gathering all your vital records and such) is to obtain certifications, training and/or schooling in something that is in demand.  Do everything in your power to gain training.  I believe there are plenty of programs that are sponsored by the government/state, especially if your an ex-con/felon.  For example, you could go to trade school and learn plumbing, electrical or HVAC.  You could also obtain a CDL license.  Obtain something like that.

After that, the number one thing you should do is start putting a good chunk of your money into a 401K/IRA account.  Most employers have a 401k system in place.  All you have to do is sign up for it.  Once you have a 401k set up, you can pick the percentage of your paycheck to be placed into your 401k.  The money will automatically be taken out of your paycheck.  You can get ""pre-taxed"" contributed to your 401k.  For example, if you made $700 for that week and put 10% of your check towards 401k, that would be $70 dollars put towards your 401k.  The remaining money of your paycheck is not taxed and what you do get taxed on is $700 - $70 = $630.  So the government will see that you earned $630 dollars and tax you based on that (not the $700).  If this doesnt make sense, dont worry about it.  The point is, put alot of money towards your 401k.  I would say around 12% or more of your check.

Once you have around $15,000 saved up in 401K, i would use that 401K money towards buying your own house.  Buy one of the cheapest houses you can possibly find that has the ""Certificate of Occupancy"".  The COC just means people are allowed to live in the house.  It means the house is at a condition that is suitable to live in and the town/city deemed your house suitable to be occupied.

I would get your mortgage from ""Rocket Mortgage"" as they seem to be reliable.  You might be able to get an FDA loan where all you have to give is 3% down payment.  At a later date, you can refinance and get a better loan structure.

The point of all this is to just get your own damn housing so that you do not have to rely on a landlord.  You do not have to keep getting denial after denial after denial.  Alot of homeowners will not want to rent to you because of your status.  Along with this, there are alot of landlord tenant issues that arise regardless of your status.  Sometimes, home owners sell the house or evict you or want you out by a certain time.  Once you get kicked out, then you're back at the same thing of begging a landlord to give you a place to live.  If you get your own cheap, run down but still approved to be livable then you will be your own landlord.  You can even rent out rooms or portions of your house.

For a long time, i rentted rooms from landlords and found myself having to leave.  I would have to spend money on 1 month and half security deposits along with one mont rents.  I had to explain my situations to the landlords and I would have to get paroles approval to live in the place.  It was all a big bitch!  After growing tired of the whole thing i followed the same advice im giving you, that someone gave to me and I was able to find a very cheap house.  I was able to even rent out a portion (legally).  My monthly payments ended up being cheaper than the rooms i rented but i had so much more to myself.  I had my own kitchen, bathroom, living room and bedroom.  Mind you, it is a tiny little home but hey, its mine and its better than living in the ""hood"" waiting for something bad to happen to the landlord that will force me out into the streets.

Being that you have the status, i highly recommend you find a house.  Try to find a house that is suitable to have a part of it rented out but that even if you lose tenants, you still can afford the house even with a low paying job.  If you get a skill, then you should be able to stay above minimum wage and make payments and survive.  Good luck.",3,,2024-12-15 20:53:26,t3_1hf0stg,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1hf0stg/im_a_newly_registered_sex_offender_in_the_raleigh/m283c25/

m262f5u,comment,,"I did fifteen years in the Feds, but I fortunately avoided the SHU. However, I knew a lot of people who did not and am pretty familiar with how the federal system works from an inmate point of view. How much he (or you) can do about this depends in large part on what part of the country he is in. I did my first 7 1/2 in Texas and their attitude towards incarceration is that it's their job to make your life suck. So complaining about the time in the SHU there would have done nothing but irritate the staff. It certainly would not have helped me. The last half of my bit I was in Colorado and the attitude was much different, much more inclined towards actually treating us like humans, but not to the standards of any free world situation. The sad fact is that, unless it's something egregious, they can pretty much do what they want. They are the federal government, who's going to stop them? Basically, they can't abuse you (physically, sexually, etc), they can't refuse to feed you, they can't deny you life-saving medical attention, they can't deny you religious services and they can't deny you access to the law library. When you're in the SHU, those last two don't count, but usually only if it's disciplinary. Outside of those things, it's a battle to get anything else that you may have coming to you. My advice would be to call the prison and keep calling until he either gets his rec time or you speak with the warden. Remember that the staff there have custody of your son, not you. To you they are just a bunch of morons in matching uniforms. They have no authority over you whatsoever, so don't be afraid to confront them. Always try to be polite, of course, but don't be afraid to press your issue. Federal CO's are probably the laziest and least competent people I have ever encountered. They are poorly trained and poorly paid. The quickest way to get what you (or he) needs is to make it the path of least resistance. I guess the way to do that, if possible, depends on the details of the situation.

I don't know how helpful that was, but that's my experience. He just may have to suck up the lack of rec time. It happens.

Time out depended on how many were in the SHU and asked for Rec. They’d do the hour but would sometimes leave you out there if you wanted and nobody was waiting to go out. Depends on the CO like so much does inside.

m2ab71w,comment,,"Exceptionally common. 

I know you’re worried and I can’t imagine being in your shoes. If it was my kid, I’d also want to fight and advocate for him. 

I will preface this by saying I’ve never stepped foot in a prison as an inmate or an employee. I do, a few times a year, go and teach reentry classes and I volunteer at a few reentry services.  

Knowing what I’ve heard from inmates, what I’ve learned in interviews, and what I’ve seen at the prisons I’ve been to, I wouldn’t do a damn thing but reassure my kid that he will be out of there soon. 

This is not where I would poke the bear. 

I am sure it’s miserable, but safe and miserable is far better than a lot of the alternatives. 

This is solely my opinion, but I wouldn’t push it. I’d give it time. You definitely want him to end up placed somewhere that’s safe and right for him. If you press too much, they could just decide to stick him in whatever unit has a bed - I *have* heard more than one horror story about this happening. I have also heard stories of people being put out on the yard for an hour a day and not being properly supervised because there weren’t enough people on staff. 

Further, the wardens do have the authority to restrict or deny access to rec time if it isn’t safe for it to occur. Most prisons are woefully understaffed and it’s not difficult to say that there’s simply not enough staff to handle it (and there probably isn’t.)

I was told (told… I do not have hard evidence, etc…) by a guard (at one facility, so this also may not apply to all of them) that they do give priority to lifers, people who will be in the SHU for years, etc… when resources are limited and they have to choose between people who will spend most, or much, of their lives there over those who are there temporarily. 

The fact that they know he has parents who love and care about him and who visit him will typically make him a less likely target from administration. I wouldn’t pick a fight with them as long as he’s safe, fed, and not being mistreated. 

Again, that’s opinion, so take it for what it’s worth.",3,,2024-12-16 05:02:50,t3_1hes5ed,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1hes5ed/federal_administrative_shu_advice/m2ab71w/

Your first step is to call and ask to speak with his counselor, you don't need to know who it is, if they say you have to know who their counselor is it's a bonus your get to skip this worthless step, and then ask to speak with the warden. If you contact the warden to lodge a complaint and do not get a response, there is a regional director, above that you can contact the central BOP office (info@bop.gov or 202-307-3198).By contacting the region or central office it starts a chain of events that must be completed by the facility where the inmate is. The warden's review gets directly impacted by these queries if they do not meet the deadline. You can also contact the ACLU. Have your son file a BP9, wait the 20+20 days and then file a BP10, the 9 goes to the warden, the 10 goes to regional. The 20+20, is the amount of time the warden has to respond to the BP9, 20 days to respond that can be extended another 20 days. BP10 can be filed even if your son is just unsatisfied with the response and must be filed within 20 days of getting the wardens response. This may not seem trivial to you and your son but to them it is and your pressure will likely not get him rec time, it will get him a bed instead because that will get you to stop.

Keep copies of everything, you and your son, these people will lie and say they never got anything, and you need a copy of the BP9 when you submit your BP10. They will tell you things like the yard is a privilege, it's not, they are liars, they will tell you things like they are on lockdown, it may be true but isn't likely unless he is in a penitentiary (high).

m27o6ah,comment,,"I did 5 years in a federal low, and spent maybe 3 weeks in the SHU near the end of it, for getting into a fight (with another SO).  I honestly don't remember how often they offered to take us out but I THINK it was every day or 2 for 30 min maybe.  I never took them up on it though because it was a small area and I'd be by myself.

We had a shower in our cell.  It wasn't high quality, one of the weird ones where you push a button and it turns the water on for 30 sec, so you have to keep up with it.  But it's not terrible, plus it's nice to be able to shower whenever you want.

You should have him ask if he can get a roommate.  I had one for the first week or so and it was nice to have someone there to chat with.  Though more awkward to go to the bathroom obviously.  He went home and they didn't give me a new one for the rest of my stay, but I think since I was there for disciplinary reasons I wasn't supposed to have a roommate.  They also gave me the wrong commissary list so I was able to get some stuff I wasn't supposed to that first week to, and got a walkman.  After my roommate left I noticed my commissary list had something like ""DISCIPLINARY"" at the top and it was much more limited.

The guards (COs) there were pretty laid back.  My guess is it's one of the more relaxed shifts there and attracts guards that don't want to do a lot.  The ones that want to abuse their power and be hardasses want to be in charge of the yard or a dorm or something.",1,,2024-12-15 19:32:49,t3_1hes5ed,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1hes5ed/federal_administrative_shu_advice/m27o6ah/

Yes, I worry about my son but I know he is strong, smart and has inner resources that will see him through these months in SHU.  I feel for everyone in these deplorable circumstances.  At least my kid gets out for a weekly visit with his dad and me.

I promise that not having rec isn’t the most egregious. I’ve heard so many horrible, horrible stories. 

I don’t know where he is, but often for people in the SHU, rec is just going outside and being put in what is essentially a cage. 

I don’t know if it works this way everywhere or not, but anyone I’ve talked to about it has told me that rec time when you’re in the SHU is awful. 

They often are handcuffed and shackled and, because they are not allowed to be around other inmates, they are often stuck outdoor “cages” that aren’t any bigger than their cells. 

I know a guy who spent 8 years in the SHU. He denied the rec time because he said it was awful to just stand outside in shackles.

m24c5m8,comment,,"1. Neither your therapist nor your group members will judge you. No matter how ""depraved"" your preferences may be.

2. Absolute honesty is required, for your long-term success.

3. You will slip up and experience minor violations (watching legal porn, for instance.) Again, absolute honesty is required. Your therapy is aimed at determining how best to prevent you from recidivating. Legal porn is still porn and porn is part of your situation, so not good.

4. Unless you blatantly re-offend, you'll be fine. You will feel like your every action and thought are being assessed. They are. That's not a bad thing. Be transparently honest.

5. You'll go through a process where you will discuss and identify past experiences that may have led to your behavior. Not all such experiences are related to abuse or the such. You'll be surprised how some things in your past have affected you. Work with that and change yourself for the better.

6. SOTP doesn't last forever. If you're being honest, participating in group, opening up about yourself and your thoughts and attitudes, passing the polygraphs, and making progress toward a better life, you will eventually ""graduate"". Celebrate that success. On a related note, you most likely will be in SOTP a minimum of six months, perhaps up to a year.

7. Life hits felons hard, SO's in particular. You may find yourself thinking about those behaviors again, in a bad way. Reach out to your counselor, to your PO. With 10 years of probation, you'll be out of SOTP before probation ends.  Reach out if you begin having those thoughts, again! No one will judge, they want to help you.

8. You have a difficult journey ahead of you, perhaps more difficult than your prison experience. You have the choices to either give in to despair or to accept the situation you have created for yourself and figure out how to overcome it.

9. The AA mantra of ""one day at a time"" applies to you.

m27mnxh,comment,,"Is this just group/1 on 1 therapy or some sort of more intensive program?

I did 5 years for receipt of CP, then had weekly group therapy for a little over a year, and 1 on 1s that were I think every other week, and slowly dialed back until it's once or twice a year now.  

I think you CAN get through group in a year, if you show progress.  We had to complete a workbook with homework at the end of each chapter, but it wasn't really that hard.  More important was my 1 on 1 sessions where my therapist and I got to the bottom of why I got into CP.  Once I did that, and she saw I wasn't having any problems really, she told me I could keep coming to group if I wanted, or stop.  I might've gone now and then but it's like 20-30 min away and a pain to get to, so I said I was done heh.

As for therapy itself, I think it can be a very helpful thing.  Even though I didn't think I needed to share for help much, since I was one of the only ones there w/o addiction, I still needed advice for stuff like employment, my PO, supervision, etc.

Group is just like this reddit though, it can be super helpful to talk to people dealing w/ the same kind of stuff you are.  Definitely be honest, otherwise there's no point to being there.  We had one guy in group that kept insisting his crime was something else.  He said he had argued w/ his girlfriend and they scuffled and her shirt got torn, so when the cops showed up they thought he had SA'd her.  He kept denying it for several weeks, so the therapist brought in his paperwork and read it aloud to us.  It toooooooootally didn't line up with his story and was very different, and he finally admitted that he lied.  The rest of us just told him he didn't need to lie, that we're ALL there for SO stuff and it was stupid to lie to us.

For someone like that it's going to take longer to get off group heh.",1,,2024-12-15 19:24:56,t3_1hejprd,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1hejprd/sotp_starting_tomorrow/m27mnxh/

m27kf7i,comment,,"It's ok to be ashamed of what you feel, or did.  The important thing is to take steps to stop that.

Like...I have a friend who burps SUPER loudly all the time.  And when we're playing games online and in voice chat, he does it too and it's super annoying and gross.  He says sorry, but then keeps doing it, for years and years.

I know it's not in the same league, but it just boggles my mind that he knows he's doing something bad, seems to feel sorry about doing it to us, but then he never thinks beyond that.  Whereas most people will mute themselves, or at least turn away from their damn mic.

So if you really WANT to change how you are, just...do it.  Doesn't have to be an on/off switch kind of thing, but try to identify situations where it comes up and then think about what you can do to avoid them, or avoid thoughts.

In group therapy, we had a few guys that had a pretty bad addiction, and they found themselves watching tv/movies just because of kids.  And they'd rewind scenes in them, or even commercials, and pause and stare and stuff.  My therapist had them try a few different methods.

One was a kind of aversion therapy, where when they had urges to do something like that, they'd sniff bleach or something strong that they really didn't like.  The idea is that when they'd have those thoughts they'd associate it with that UGH feeling of sniffing bleach, and hopefully stop having so many urges.

Another tool she suggested was to imagine that, when you had bad thoughts, that the people around you could hear those thoughts.  Or, that they were being transmitted directly to someone you cared about a lot.  The idea here being that you might be able to cut down on urges and stuff if like...your mom was hearing them.

You could/should also try to limit your exposure to places with a lot of kids in them as well.  Not saying don't go to walmart or anything, but be aware of anything you might do that someone not attracted to this kind of stuff might do.  Maybe you go down aisles you really don't need to, or might change direction in a store to follow a group of kids or something.  Try to identify anything like that, and over time it won't come up as much anymore.",2,,2024-12-15 19:13:19,t3_1hegvc6,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1hegvc6/how_do_you_fell/m27kf7i/

Childhood abuse and adverse experiences can lead you to be ""stuck"" developmentally. Your brain in one area is still 5, or 10 or whatever age your target is. Usually this is not any fault of yours, but of experiences that happened to you. With puberty, this ""stuck"" age has become sexualised. A good therapist can help you untangle what is stuck and help you to  stop sexualising and fantasizing about it. Working on empathy can help too.

m26fsk1,comment,,"It's not going to go away. But I bet there are other things you want or desire that will never go away either that you can't have.

It's going to be a constant struggle, one that you have to work on everyday.

You just need to figure out ways to become a better person overall. I'll list some ways, I hope they help.

1. Thoughts are ok by themselves but the more you think about something, the more you want it/want to do it. Try techniques like whenever you think this stuff, instantly remind yourself that it's disgusting and what would everyone think about you. Imagine people coming to your door and screaming with pitchforks. Negative reinforcement I think it's called.

2. Find a person, real or fake, who you admire and think about how that person would feel about you if you did something like this.

3. Work on yourself, get in the gym, make more money, be a person others look up to. Make sure you have something to be proud of with yourself.

4. Remind yourself you are a good person, you don't want to hurt anyone and there's more to life than the desires that are illegal and hurt others. 

5. If you have any young family members imagine how you'd feel if someone hurt them every time you have these thoughts of a minor.

m22msnn,comment,,"I was in Vegas before and after my 5 years, been back since 2017.  I WAS a tier 1 at first, but then a year or so after I got back, a new law was adopted, the adam walsh act.  That recalculated EVERYONE'S tier.  And the vast majority of people moved up.  Tons that weren't even tier 1 were bumped up and now had to register.  Us tier 1 receipt/possession people were moved to 2, which sucked big time.  Now we showed up on normal background checks.

I don't think many tier 2s moved to 3s at least, but still, the whole thing was a disaster.  The therapists hate it, the POs hate it, not sure if it was good for anyone other than whatever government person could say ""I did this for the kids!"" and get re-elected.

The problem is it makes the whole thing automated.  It just flags certain keywords in your charges or something and assigns tiers that way.  And because it's automated, there's no wiggle room or room for appeal.  I don't even know IF you can change tier.  I think my therapist told me about another SO that tried by going in front of a judge and the judge basically said that assigning tiers wasn't something the court did, and to take it up with carson city.  But whatever department handles that told him that the law assigns tiers a certain way and...that's that.

m2158tf,comment,,"There's a lot of ""don't bond him out,"" and I'm not a dissenting voice for that. Yet one reason not stated for leaving him there is that his prison sentence will begin to run, so he will eventually be released sooner. Pretrial tends to take longer when someone is out on bond, delaying the serving of his sentence.

On the flip side, if he was actually innocent (which doesn't sound like the case here), bonding him out would give him more access to resources (even with restrictions on home confinement, it's better access than county jail) so he could actively participate in his defense.",1,,2024-12-14 16:10:26,t3_1hdvl0l,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1hdvl0l/really_just_how_im_feeling_rn/m2158tf/
m22lbrw,comment,,"What's CM?  Also, did he do this stuff TO his wife and stepkids or was it to other people and you meant he ""did it to them"" as in brought this all into their lives.  

I was never abused so I can't speak to how that affects SOs, but I have to imagine it's a huge thing.  I think the most important thing to figure out is if he's sorry or if he's just sorry he got caught.  If he genuinely is ashamed and repentant, and wants to get help, then being out on bond could be good for everyone.  

Also, actually more important is how your sister is taking it.  If she doesn't want him around her and the rest of the family uhhhh it's kind of moot.  If she thinks he can be helped and NOT do any of that again, and she's going to stick by him, it'll be much better for her to have him on hand as well.

House arrest doesn't usually mean you're confined to the home 24/7.  I was on house arrest for a bit over a year, and i could leave between 8am and 8pm.  It was after 8pm that I had to be home and stay within 50ft of the monitor thing they had me plug in.  So, again, assuming he wants (and you guys think he can) get better, there is a lot he can do while on house arrest.  He can go to therapy, get a job, meet with lawyers, etc.  If it looks like jail time is a sure thing, he can work on getting affairs in order and things prepared for when he leaves.

Also keep in mind that when the gov't charges you, they throw everything they can at first.   They expect you to take a plea deal and if they throw a ton of charges, your lawyers have to fight all the more to get it down.  I was charged with receipt, possession, and distribution for downloading CP online.  But my plea deal was just for 1 count of receipt, and it was still 6 years.  If I had gone to trial I would've had to fight all the charges and would've gotten more time.  Can't really win stuff like that other than in extraordinary circumstances with tons of reasonable doubt.  Like if a ton of people had access to the computer and they weren't sure it was me specifically that had downloaded stuff.

Either way, I'd say talk to your sister and see what she thinks.  If she's going to be a wreck with him locked away while his case is fought, it might be better to bond him out, if possible.  Even if he's staying an hour away.  If she's planning on leaving him, and only wants to bond him out for his sake, well...that's laudable, but at that point it's something to only do if it's financially easy.",-1,,2024-12-14 21:09:02,t3_1hdvl0l,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1hdvl0l/really_just_how_im_feeling_rn/m22lbrw/

Since he cannot be at the residence with his wife and step children, he would be at his uncle’s house and no one is really available to provide him 24/7 watch, we live an hour away and his uncle works and he is to have no contact with his wife. His father’s home is filled with children and his mom lives out of state. 

I feel like in jail he would have less opportunity to self harm and they do have counselors in jail and there are churches that regularly go to the jail. So if he wants to seek counseling or seek God he can still do that from the inside. 

As to his innocence… the FBI raided his home and found a hidden cellphone and took the hard drive from his computer which per the court apparently had 60,000+ images and videos which they are still going through. The FBI did interviews with his stepchildren and that’s when he was arrested for CM while on bond for the four CP charges. It’s not a question of if he is innocent, the question is how far does this extend and how bad will it get… While he was previously on bond his wife asked him all the questions and it’s bad and per BIL “it gets worse” which is super ominous.

m1wp1q2,comment,,"A sex offender needs to travel to a foreign country on short notice—less than 21 days—because of an unforeseeable family or work emergency. The sex offender would have a defense to liability for failing to report the intended travel 21 days in advance, as required by § 72.7(f), because it is impossible to report an intention to travel outside the United States before the intention exists. However, if the sex offender failed to inform the registration jurisdiction (albeit on short notice) once he intended to travel, 18 U.S.C. 2250(c) would not excuse that failure, because the preventing circumstance—absence of an intent to travel abroad—would no longer exist.

I was convicted of second degree sexual assault on a 12 year old minor. However there was no physical contact alleged so the laws have to be a little bit more specific than they are. If somebody saw my charges they would assume that I molested or hurt a child physically when all I did was take a shower in the a public shower.

m227kpc,comment,,Some of them don't the govenor that enacted the 85% NERA act in New Jersey tried to have it overturned after her daughter got caught up in it. And I believe Megan's brother from Megan's law is also on the registry. They all tried to overturn it but it didn't work. They activate these laws because they never think that their kids will ever be involved in such a situation and when they are then they try to overturn them but they can't.

m1uzj90,comment,,"The two most difficult things for RSOs is finding a decent job and decent housing. There are many people on this sub that had accomplished careers prior to their offense and now struggle to find even a decent warehouse job. There are many more that struggle to find any job at all. It certainly can be done, but it typically takes a lot of time and effort to accomplish. 

Housing is difficult for two reasons... local residency restrictions and the fact that the vast majority of landlords won't rent to RSOs. Owning a home certainly makes that easier, but you still have to deal with any local restrictions. Any residence will have to be approved by probation before he will be allowed to live there. 

Having gone through federal supervision, it's almost a certainty that his conditions will not allow him to be in the direct presence of minors without approval from his PO. How that relates to your children will depend on your state laws as well as the conditions that the court put on him and how probation interprets those terms. But it's extremely doubtful that he'll be allowed to go watch your kids race until he has been in treatment for a while and shown that he's progressing well. And then it would only be allowed with an approved chaperone. In my case I was in treatment for two years before I was allowed to get a chaperone approved. The timing of that will vary depending on the treatment provider and the PO.

I can't speak for the USPS, but I vaguely recall seeing a post on here saying that it was possible to work there. In what capacity though, I don't know. I will say that a positive attitude will be very important in succeeding after he's released, but it has to be a realistic one as well. He will have a lot of restrictions initially. They tend to lessen them a bit once you prove that you can be trusted. The thing you hope for the most is to get a decent PO, as they will pretty much dictate your life while on supervision.",13,,2024-12-13 14:10:58,t3_1hdbujg,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1hdbujg/reality_vs_high_hopes/m1uzj90/
m1x0egu,comment,,"You could always contact USPS and just ask them.  Doesn't have to be your real email with your name or anything.

Housing can be hard, but it sounds like it's more a specific local issue.  Like here in Las Vegas, I don't have a certain distance I have to be away from parks/schools.  It's totally up to my PO.  If I'm obviously close they'd deny it.  Are you in a house or is moving a possibility?  Can maybe find something not too far that doesn't have extra restrictions.

BMX track...it's possible?  I'm not familiar with that, so not sure if it's a kids-focused kind of place.  I'm a tier 2 SO, did 5 years for receipt of CP and been out since late 2017.  Obviously I can't go to parks.  But earlier this year my friend/roommate got a dog, so I asked my PO if I could go to dog parks. She said sure, but to not go out of my way to talk to minors.  Like...if one happens to come up to me and says hi, I don't have to run off screaming or anything, but try to extricate myself as soon as I can.  Kind of like the same thing at a store or restaurant or anything like that.  I'm not expected to NEVER interact with a kid, but I should limit it and not initiate it.

A lot depends on the PO, so hopefully you'll get a good one.  I think mine is awesome and hope I don't get transferred ever lol. She's the 3rd one I've had, but it's been 2-3 years so far.

I don't know how your husband would feel about food industry work, but I've had several restaurant jobs and I liked them, for the most part.

My original j&s specifically allowed me contact with my own children but the PO office in Washington said I had to accept new conditions that only allow me contact with my own children with the PO and treatment provider's permission in order to gain release to their district in Washington.

Don't get your hopes up. If the President ever gave you a pardon for a sex offense, you'd make history as the FIRST person to ever receive one, at least as far as I can find through the link above. 

None of the recent pardons are for sex offenses. I can't tell what the commutations were because they just made a list of 1500 names & BOP #s but supposedly they're all ""non-violent"" offenses.

His attorneys attempted to contact reps from the group and either the phones were disconnected or the primary number goes straight to a voicemail box that is full. Their PO box also shows that it is no longer registered. 


All the other providers for sex offenders no longer take adults either. The state's primary insurance provider nixed all mental health for anyone 18 or over as of June 1st of this year and only a select few perform Abel Assessments of the court orders it and the defendant pays for it, but they don't provide any ongoing SOTP. 


It's insane. Even the other state defense l attorneys that specialize in these kinds of cases have no idea who to turn to foe treatment and the legislature won't touch the wording of the statute.

m1t4rwq,comment,,"So, yes and no. In the summer of 1996, when I was 16 years old, I touched a young girl inappropriately. I was arrested, I believe in the late fall of 1996, held for 2 weeks at the juvenile detention center before being released on what was called ""Closed Street Supervision."" This was during the case building for a potential trial. 
During the time in the juvenile facility, word spread like a wildfire throughout my neighborhood. Naturally, I lost some friends. Their parents didn't want their children to associate with someone who could have done such a heinous act. That was my first taste of this scarlet letter. 
However, things would return to a rather normal life. I spent the majority of 1997 going back and forth between court dates and meeting with my public defender all the while not having to register. In the early part of December 1997 while I was 17 I would enter the plea of ""No Contest"" at the advice of my public defender, where part of my agreement was to spend my time in a youth correctional facility, and complete their SOTP. 
This was all done in adult court, so while I was a juvenile offender, with no run-ins with the law, I was still charged as an adult with a lifetime registry requirement.   While in the juvenile facility, I ended up signing my waiver and was transferred to the adult facility when I was 19. My time in the adult system was not at all like the horror stories. Perhaps it was because I was a juvenile offender. Perhaps it was a higher power at work. I don't know why, but never had I ever had any issues because of my charges. 
Once I was released in September of 2001, I was released via an ""Interstate Compact,"" where I moved to another state to serve my Post Prison Supervision. There I would enter and successfully complete my SOTP, something that I wasn't ready to do while in the juvenile facility. I've had minimal negative interactions regarding my past,  and I was even allowed to join my local fire district as a volunteer firefighter. YES, they knew about my past, but still gave me a chance to serve my community. The lessons that I learned in the SOTP really came to life during this time in the fire district. 
Really, the only negative issues that I've had were finding driving jobs as a truck driver, as there were alot of companies that didn't want to take the chance of having an SO drive for them,  but I found companies that would take that chance and they have all been good to me. And the only other issue was when I moved to a new state, finding housing at first, but again, that too sorted itself out. 
That all said, I still have fears that someone will see me on the registry even after all that I've accomplished. I worry about the vigilantes that think that they can take matters into their own hands. I also worry about my wife and kids being harassed, but fortunately those haven't happened.",10,,2024-12-13 04:06:56,t3_1hcvrgi,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1hcvrgi/were_any_of_you_registered_sex_offenders_as_a/m1t4rwq/

m1n27pg,comment,,"Every state is different, as is federal. You’ll really need to share the state you’re in, whether it’s a a state or federal case, and the state he was convicted in (if it’s a state case).  Also sharing what he was convicted of is important because it will be relevant when it comes to the rules and restrictions in a lot of places. 

Generally, with a state conviction, you can very easily be released to the county you were convicted in, pretty easily (a little more work in some states but rarely denied) be released anywhere in the state of conviction as long as you have family, a job, or some sort of support system there, and can often be released to a different state if you have those things there. 

Feds will release people most anywhere they have family or a support system (most of the time).",3,,2024-12-12 03:43:51,t3_1hcc08b,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1hcc08b/trying_to_help_my_brother/m1n27pg/

m1viwnv,comment,,"""Consequences"" is very open-ended. What I can tell you is that most Reegistered Persons are going to struggle with housing & employment. Mississippi's residency restrictions, for example, are very strict:

RPs shall not reside within 3,000 ft of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic elementary or secondary school, a child care facility, a residential child-caring agency, a children's group care home or any playground, ballpark or other recreational facility utilized by persons under age 18 years. Does not apply only in limited circumstances. MCA §45-33-25(4)

m1osh0o,comment,,"Mississippi will be rough. I believe it’s one of the states that doesn’t have set laws for SO probation and that the conditions are assigned by the judge. The PO and treatment provider can typically add more of them. 

They passed a law over the summer stating that SO’s are no longer eligible for parole. 

They passed a lot of mandatory minimum laws, laws regarding fees and restitution, etc… hopefully these links will go where they’re supposed to. Their website is obnoxious. 

I don’t know if the new laws apply to him or not, sometimes they go in to effect based on the date of the crime, sometimes based on when they were charged, sometimes based on the date of the sentencing. I also don’t know if they can offer less than the minimum in a plea deal in Mississippi. I can’t think of anyone in the group off the top of my head who is there but hopefully there’s someone it’s easy to read the laws, but harder to understand the actual effect of them without personal experience. 

But, these are the new sentencing guidelines:

The residence restrictions are harsh, he can’t live within 3000 feet of a school or daycare, can’t “loiter “ within 500 feet of them, and can’t step foot on the property. 

There are a lot of laws about notifying employers and the notifications you have to make if you work somewhere that employs minors. It makes it a lot more difficult to find a job. 

It can affect you, if you want to do certain types of jobs. It can affect your relationships with friends and family, the level of responsibility you have in your relationships, etc… 

You’re very young. I wouldn’t recommend rushing in to marriage, especially when you have no idea what life will be like. I’d give it some time and see if you want to deal with the effects of the registry or not.

I would recommend getting married while he is in federal prison. This will be easier than once he’s out and remove a lot of the drama with the PO when he’s released. There is a whole procedure to go through to do this, but once he’s at his designated facility, the Chaplin there can help you guys. 

This is just my advice here, but I would wait on the marriage bit until he’s over halfway through his sentence. First, you don’t know how long he’s going to get and prison is *hard* on relationships.

They’re the most harsh, for sure, but there are quite a few other states that require various types of notification if you aren’t going to be at home for a specified amount of time.

I personally think the law reads as if you are moving from one county to another in AZ. But the sheriff's office officer said even going on vacation... she said one must ""de-register here then register in the next county in the state so AZ can notify of them of your travel"". The law is vague and i think currently in the Ninth Court of Appeals. AZ law used to say 10 days. In fact AI will say 10 days. That is incorrect. Plus different counties interpret it the way they want. Speak to an attorney. 

Now how does that fit that into vague random travel and one doesn't stay on one county or state long enough to have to register?.

Many states do this.

Then — speak at colleges if you can.  People like Dr. Emily Horowitz and Dr. Alissa Ackerman and Dr. Alexa Sardina are all training the next generation- and using creative approaches with facts. 

And - form unlikely alliances where possible — like survivor groups.  Show up in criminal reform spaces and make your voice heard.

I've learned that so many sex offender guidelines at federal, state, or even municipal registry guidelines go unchecked for violations of an individual's constitutional rights. It's difficult because most on the registry don't have the means to fight these types of guidelines and/or don't want to bring anymore attention to themselves that the uninformed public would react negatively to. For the few times certain SO requirements were challenged, it was usually (but not always) favored to the plaintiff and was viewed as unconstitutional. As far as the public perception, until most people have had a negative interaction with the justice system they will have a vindicated perception of a person accused of a crime.

The issue is the public registry and we have Adam Walsh to thank for that. I honestly really feel for what happened to his child but he created the public registry to publicly shame sex offenders. The registry in no way helps the general public as I know many that don’t have even know it exists. You know who do know? Those who actively look to cause problems for those on the registry. 

I’m from Mexico and even Mexico abolished the registry because they found it violated your rights and also made it much more difficult to reintegrate into society which is what you want ex cons to do. 

So how do we change it? Start with the state then move to the country. Some states are more for rehabilitation and reintegration so those states will be easier to change. Documentaries, interviews, public speaking or hearings. Basically just showing the public that people can change or recover and are sorry for what they did but simply want to reintegrate.",0,,2024-12-12 23:02:02,t3_1hc3qin,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1hc3qin/in_your_experience_what_actually_changes_peoples/m1rr81r/

m1vl57j,comment,,"Just curious .. are you in favor of  a lifetime of registration? Even Jacob Wettering's family has changed their minds about lifetime punishment with the registration. All who have charged and sentenced for a sex offense acknowledged their terrible choice and take full accountability for their actions. However, all new laws for sex offenders are always retroactive. This is not the case for those convicted of murders, drug dealings, or other crimes. Plus each state can make take the federal SORNA law then make it more restrictive in their state if they want. Plus, some states make all (regardless of risk or level or offense) register for life while others allow a pathway off the registry. And if the individual wants to move to another state, most states have passed laws that basically say ""Well if you had been convicted here, we'll let you of registry in 10, 15, or 25 years but since your state says lifetime, then you must register lifetime if you move here""  I'm a wife of a person who was convicted of a crime of sexual nature--- 40 years ago. He acknowledges it was a stupid mistake and he was wrong. He served probation with treatment and at the time was told after ten years, he would be off the registry. Then a new law in 1995, changed that to lifetime registry. Then every few years, more laws until now at age 80 and never ever convicted of ANY crime including speeding, the laws are so restrictive, he can't take a vacation without notifying our state so they can term the state we're visiting and registering where we visit. Now the new law will put the lowest level of risk on the public registry so the new life we built with church and community and family will be destroyed. Our neighbors and churches will receive community notification and he will be on the registry -- after 40 years. There's no drug dealer registry or murderer or manslaughter registry, or habitual robbery registry. That would be considered punitive and unconstitutional. However, the courts have decided -- against all science of least likely to re-offend for many on the registry -- that anyone --regardless of the crime or risk-- must be registered, tracked, accounted for and each new law is retroactively applied ONLY for sex offenders because it's ""regulatory"" for sex offenders and not punitive.  I would say most on this site are against the unconstitutionality of retroactive and punitive laws. My husband paid his debts. Lost his career. Lost the family he had at that time. Completed his sentencing. Changed his life. Built a new life with new family but now that could possibly be destroyed when everyone finds out because new laws are happening annually.  He lives with his guilt daily.  ",2,,2024-12-13 16:13:55,t1_m1p5ien,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1hc3qin/in_your_experience_what_actually_changes_peoples/m1vl57j/

m1zhs6e,comment,,"First of all, since you are a victim, I'm truly truly sorry.  There are so many many different kinds of offenses of sexual nature. Some are consensual, some are violent, some are predatory, some are images, some are ""attempted consensual"". All are wrong and deserving of legal action and sentencing guidelines (which become tougher and tougher thru the years - while punishment fit other crimes get lighter and lighter) The problem is ALL crimes of a sexual nature are then dumped into one ginormous pool so that the registry becomes a punishment. When my husband's face eventually does up in the registry because of new laws, it will not say he is a level one - latest possible risk.  It will not say the date this happened - 40 years ago. It will not say he was convicted of an ""attempted"" action. It will appear that anyone who reads it that he is a violent sexual predator that needs to be avoided.  He will be subject to vigilante action and his life and mine could be in danger (yes, a young man in  Pennsylvania who was a level one ofrece- lowest possible risk - was murdered last month simply because someone saw his name on the registry). Also, my husband has a unique identifier on the front page of hIs passport now that states he Is a sex offender because some lawmakers passed more ""feel good"" legislation convincing the public that ALL sex offenders must also be human traffickers, so the passport when shown will ""warn"" anyone  my husband must be extremely dangerous! Far far from the truth. Because of yet more legislation passed, he must also give 21 day notice to the local police department that he intends to take a vacation to Europe. He has to provide air or cruise  itinerary plus hotel information so that the US Justice department can warn the other countries that this dangerous 80 year old man and his wife are coming to visit. BTW, he is not allowed to visit many many countries now with this new legislation because the US now allows many countries to have access to our data base. Every year new punishment (I'm sorry, they say regulatory) is heaped on those on the registry. Yes, we should have looked into a crystal ball to see what states would have de-registered him. Better yet, he shouldn't have committed the crime. 
The registry is a life-time sentence for the offender regardless of level of crime and a lifetime sentence for the  family members. He is at zero risk of reoffending.  
I guess I'm curious as to the ""WHY"" a person who paid his debt to society should have to be on the registry for life if all prison, probation, sentencing, counseling yesterday was completed 40 years previous AND all science proves that he is no more likely to offend as your next door neighbor or your own brother who has never offended.

m1hdh3c,comment,,"I have my own IT services company. 

Focus mostly on sales revenue operations tech stack. Plenty of consulting dollars and, since everything is cloud/saas, there are no laptop issues. However I have been off probation for over 6 years.

I focus on companies between 10m - 50m ARR, but hooked a much larger one recently. 

The background rules are fairly lax, if you’re employed by a corporation and contracting through it. In other words, companies hire my corporation to provide services…I’m just the employee who delivers it.

Im a former CISSP that worked for one of the largest software companies in the world. I looked into becoming an MSP. Seems like lots of oppty but I didn’t want the stress. You may want to look into that.

I have had disagreements with people on this sub on the business entity so do your own research.

My name is attached to my corporation. It’s never been an issue.

I use a different first name aka an alias on LinkedIn and in my professional career. Let’s say your given name is Sam Paul Smith. Nothing stopping you in California  from going as Paul Smith professionally or even Donald Smith.

The key to all this: stay solution focused and you’ll figure it out. My suggestion is find a speciality and get good at it.

Being that you're open to opening up your own business and you already have experience in IT then their might be good cause for you.  However, if your crime was internet related it might be a challenge, however, i would still consult with a lawyer and try to see what motions could be in place to uplift restrictions for your or your business.

m1dmsw9,comment,,"It's going to depend a little bit upon your state, but NARSOL has a state wiki site at [https://statewiki.narsol.org/doku.php?id=start](https://statewiki.narsol.org/doku.php?id=start) which breaks down all the services in your state.  I'd start there.

There's also some national programs as well just depending upon what your needs are.

Depending upon the program your husband winds up in (incarceration, probation, etc.) there are support programs available.  If he's fortunate enough for probation, he'll likely have group therapy to attend.  That program should have a spousal program.  That program is for support (or it's supposed to be) as well as an approved chaperone program.  It takes a while to go through it but I'd recommend leaning in to them where you can.

If you can't find something, look into something like an al-anon program.  Yes they may be more related to alcoholism, but they are ultimately support programs.

m1h0fhx,comment,,"Did you get a lawyer at any point?  That sounds a lot like my experience when I was raided for CP, but you sound like you're waaaaaay farther into the process.

When the FBI came pounding on my door and told me what was up, I immediately asked for a lawyer.  They said I wasn't ""technically"" under arrest, and if I wanted a lawyer they couldn't say whether I would be arrested or not.  So I cooperated for a while, and then after 20-30 min asked for a lawyer again.  Then they said that if I stopped cooperating, they couldn't tell a judge I was, and it ""might"" have adverse reactions.  I think I asked for a lawyer a THIRD time and they kept being scumbags about it.

They tried to trip me up and get details and I was just trying to be as vague as I could.  I mean, I knew I was guilty.  I had stuff downloading on my PC when they came in lol.  But they really do try their best to scare the shit out of you so you confess to everything.  Makes their job easier.

If you haven't gotten one, get a lawyer ASAP.  And don't talk to them again without one, they are NOT your friend.  They can be expensive but if you call around you might get lucky and find one willing to work for a flat rate instead of hourly.  Mine charged \~$7k and let me pay in monthly installments.

Do you have anyone you can talk to irl?  I told my mom right away because I needed her $$ help, but I don't think I told anyone else what was going on.  Not until \~1.5 years after my raid when I was actually arrested.  Then some friends and family found out because the PSI guy had to call people for references, and I needed a ride home from the courthouse heh.

Regardless of what happens, your life isn't over.  Plenty of us here on the reddit have done prison time and come out on the other side doing fine.  Maybe not fine AND dandy, but you know...good enough.  Yeah there are a small number of people that have to deal with crazy stuff, but it seems much rarer than people just living their lives.

The part you're at is easily the worst and most stressful.  All the uncertainty and not knowing what's going to happen.",4,,2024-12-11 03:44:20,t3_1hb27cx,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1hb27cx/im_unsure_what_to_do/m1h0fhx/

m1ml5l3,comment,,"Listen, a public defender will always be better than no lawyer. They are real, practicing attorneys in real practices. I ended up with one that was very kind and compassionate towards me. I was surprised. It was a pleasant surprise of course. 

You need to speak to an attorney ASAP. Don't be stubborn. Don't think you know better. Speak to an attorney. Tomorrow. 

No advice on if they could raid you or what. But don't ever speak to them again without an attorney present. If they do show up at your place, ask to see the warrant. If they have one, just let them in. Before you do let them in, ask them how to proceed with your dog so that it doesn't get in their way/scare them and so that the dog is safe as well. Also explain about the cats and ask how to handle that so they don't get outside (I'm just assuming that's your worry with the cats).

I'm assuming they assume you have other devices. This will make them want to show up and search, of course. So, speak to a public defender ASAP. 

The other thing about public defenders is that if you just really feel like you don't vibe with them, you can request a different attorney. This does take more time and you run the risk of essentially being between attorneys when they show up (if they do).

Typically, if a parent is dating a RSO and the other parent fights for custody, the other parent wins more often than not. A letter from a probation officer saying someone had permission to go to an event isn’t going to just “kill everything for a judge.” 

This is not rocket science. Most judges don’t want the liability. Most probation officers aren’t going to get involved with someone else’s custody dispute either.",1,,2024-12-11 03:04:18,t1_m1gtt6q,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1hapwqz/what_do_i_do/m1gufjk/

m1n5pi8,comment,,"Up to you. 
But. If you DO tell them: 

Don't minimize. Say you committed a crime and you regret it and what you're doing to address your issues that led you there. 

Don't say ""but I didn't even hurt anyone!"" ""I'm not one of the bad guys who actually do that"" ""it's just pictures"" etc etc etc. 

Don't pressure anyone to stay friends. Offer them an out - ""if this is too much, I understand."" No one owes you their friendship, because it is costly to befriend an offender. Little thing called secondary stigma. Our friends have been questioned by others, by child protection, by police.... it's not a simple, straightforward friendship anymore. 

All the best with who you tell! Personally, I think close friends and immediate family should know but others you rarely see don't necessarily need to.

He found that just being honest was the best policy. Very few of his friends/family members deserted him; most were supportive and are still there for him.

m1nvwk1,comment,,"I'd say that being remanded in this situation, even with already being on the Register, is a slight surprise. But just because someone is remanded into custody, doesn't mean that they will stay in prison after sentencing. A suspended sentence is still possible if the sentence given is 24 months or under. The judge may feel that a taste of custody is what was needed, but immediate release onto a suspended sentence and Suspended Sentence Order (ie Probation requirements and supervision) is a better rehabilitative option. Probation's pre-sentence report will be important in this decision. However, if your partner is waiting for a trial (ie will be pleading not guilty) then expect a very long wait. In this situation, you might want to ask a solicitor if an application for bail is appropriate.

m1nznxf,comment,,"Sounds like he's not on a suspended sentence now though. Breach of the SHPO might be the more serious offence, and makes it difficult, but not impossible. Depends on what he is charged with. If it's sexual communications with someone under 16, then max sentence is 24 months (and so suspendible), and any time on remand would be taken into account (treated as part of any subsequent custodial sentence).  If the charge is more serious, then custodial sentence may be inevitable though the same rule for time already served still applies",1,,2024-12-12 08:46:09,t1_m1nwa65,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1ha52un/uk_online_operations/m1nznxf/

m138acu,comment,,"Pre-trial was harder for me by far.  I was raided back in \~2010, had a ton of CP on my computer and various discs.  Took almost 1.5 years before they came back to arrest me though.  I was let out on my own recognizance and had an ankle monitor.  I worked from home (tech support for apple) so I didn't need to be out late, so they gave me from 8am-8pm to be out of the house.  Then I had uhhhh 50ft or something?  Couldn't get much farther out the door really.  That job was for a year and I decided not to renew because of all the legal crap I was going through.  I wound up moving in w/ my best friends and their parents, and running errands/driving for room and board.  My pre-trial guy didn't think this warranted a finagling of my hours.

What sucked was that they didn't allow me any internet devices.  When I finally got to prison (did 5 years for receipt) I met another guy from Vegas who had the same situation and same pre-trial officer.  His guy let him have a computer, videogames, and phone with monitoring software.  He even let him leave town and go to lake tahoe for the weekend.  Whereas he denied ME going to CA for a wedding.

I've been out since 2017, well, early 2018 is when I moved out of the  halfway house and had my own place.  Supervision (I have lifetime) is much much easier.  I have a gaming PC, iphone, and videogames, and monitoring software on the first 2 that I don't have to pay for.  I have no inclination to break any of my restrictions so  it's not like I'm going to accidentally look at a bunch of porn.  I have once or twice a year polygraphs, also don't have to pay for that, that are annoying but again, nothing I'm really worried about.  I just wish I could go and get it over with in 20 min, instead of a 2-hour hassle.

Definitely sucks that you're going through all that with your wife and daughter.  What does your lawyer think of your chances?  I only have experience with being obviously guilty lol.  Everyone I knew in jail was duh guilty as well.  There was oneeeee guy who stuck to his story that he had accidentally stumbled on 2-3 pics, contacted the police himself, and then was arrested and given 8 years.

What I don’t get either is that they keep saying I was on all a bunch of chat apps too. I had them yes but never really used them much — Kik has seemed to come up a lot. Never really got into that one, used Telegram the most.

During the pandemic was pretty rough and wife checked out for the most part. Probably have a porn addiction too. Was more into camming cause you could talk to and interact with people. I know not the best thing but escaped the real world for a little while.

Lawyer is having it all gone over with forensic experts. Not sure of how all of that works or what they can do but lawyer says that is what you do in cases like this.  And he is having a security specialist look into all the accounts. Said it might have been hacked and used without my knowledge.

One thing you'll find out are who your true friends really are. The ones that are still with you; hold onto them tightly. The rest; let them go! Move on. If those old acquaintances try to come around, say ""high and goodbye"". 

DON'T GO BACK INTO THE SITUATIONS that led you to your offense. Stay away from them. Don't contact the victim or family----Ever! Move on. Don't let them contact you either. If they do, let police know immediately. Happened to me. 

You aren't the first person to get convicted of a sex offense and you won't be the last. Forget it. Move on. 

But, learn a new skill or trade. Google website now offers Google certificates. Check it out. Careers that pay very well. Certificates are very affordable too.

Tier 1 is 10 years required registration. Then you're no longer required. 

Tier 2 is 25 years registration. Then you're no longer required. 

Tier 3 is lifetime registration. This is where you need a good lawyer who specializes in Sex Offenses. You'll apply and if the Judge wants to hear your case, you'll be assigned to a court approved counselor---That report will go to the courts long before you appear in Court.

In Virginia, however, the situation is different. If you have two or more charges at any time, you are on the registry for life due to legislative changes. That said, if you move out of Virginia, you are no longer required to remain on the state’s registry.

m10cz3q,comment,,"You want off the Registry? Don't we all. Welp, let's look at this. 

1. How long since you been out of prison? Did you go to prison? 

2. Have you repaid all financial penalties incurred as a result of your conviction? 

3. How many felonies do you have on your record?

4. Have you fulfilled all post release obligations including counseling, probationary period, etc? Any violations reported? 

5. Have you led a law abiding life since your release from probation or incarceration? Very important. 

Now, the Court will look at all of these factors when you get an attorney and start the process.

You'll need an attorney that specializes in Sex Offenses, not just any lawyer. It'd be a good idea that a person waits at least a minimum of 15-25 years AFTER INCARCERATION RELEASE, to hire an attorney to look into the matter. 

You must have a declaration from a licensed counselor approved by the Court to declare that you're no longer a viable threat to the community. Your attorney will explain this in detail. This varies state by state. 

Cost: 10k-25k. It ain't cheap. 

****If you're not registering for life, do your registrations and get it over with. But if you're tier 3 life, then it would be worth looking into, but only after 15-25 years have passed since you got out of prison. Anything less, and the Court will look at it as a mockery. You'll piss the Judge off.

It wasn't too bad, I could be out and about between 8am and 8pm.  I was always very worried people would see it, so wore pants all the time.  Which was awful here in Vegas summer lol.  But other than not being able to go out late at night it didn't really matter.  I didn't travel out of state or anything much, and you CAN ask for an exemption for certain things.  

My pre-trial guy was a jerk and denied my request to go to a cousin's wedding, and also wouldn't let me have any internet devices.  What was insane is that I had a friend in prison who had the SAME pre-trial guy while in Vegas, and he not only was allowed to have videogames/computer with monitoring software, but he let him go to lake tahoe for a weekend just to get away!

I guess some advice I could give is to be extra aware of his hours and don't suggest things he can't do.  My friends (who I lived with at the time) did that a lot.

As for your pediatrician, I don't think you have to tell them everything?  You could be vague while still getting all the forms signed.  Say you're going through some personal issues, don't want to get into them, but need him to sign this form.  If he still needs more you can say there have been accusations...I think a doctor should be professional and not keep digging, hopefully.  But if he insists then tell him I guess, whatever gets the form signed.  But then find a new pediatrician.

Not sure if you've spent a lot of time browsing this reddit, but many/most of us have been able to find jobs.

Well, they WOULD be fine if they weren't blowing a bunch of their $$ on drinks and weed anyway.  As it was, they were struggling.

Food service stuff here in Vegas doesn't seem to do background checks.  I've been tier 2 for a good \~5 years and managed to get into restaurants right on the strip.  Don't know if I could get a job IN a casino, but there are plenty of opportunities here.  I was content with bussing after doing hosting/dishwashing, but it would've been pretty easy to move up to server.  It's not glamorous, but can be good $$.

m0vkst7,comment,,"Some additional info on background checks.  I’ve had to run background checks on other people and I’ve had background checks run — so I have a bit of real life experience— not just theoretical.    When I would run them, my company used a service called HireRight.  I could select what we needed.   I was advised to select the “Best practice criminal package”.  It would go and look at the state and federal criminal databases and report back any records found.  If the municipality had the record, it was passed back. It also checked the registry.  

In 2020, I came off the registry and in 2021, my record was expunged.  I’ve since had a few background checks run on me. When Airbnb’s background company ran a check, it came back with hits.  The reason — they didn’t go back to the state source— the relied on outdated data.  That’s not appropriate or legal — but it’s cheaper for them to run their checks that way than deal with the false positives.  

The second was a recruiting firm earlier this year as I’m looking for employment. They ran a check and it came back 100% clean. 

Hope that helps.

m0vp6q5,comment,,"Thanks for the detailed responses.
So, it seems as if the various levels of background check, when coupled with the various components within the report, will cause the information reported to have differing durations.

The criminal components I can think of are:
Arrest Record 
Charge Record
Conviction Record
Sentence Record
Actively on Parole Record -?
Actively on Probation Record - ?
SO Registry Record 

Then there is the question of how far back a background check will look. Don’t some states limit the time frame?

As mentioned by other responses, all of this is meaningless if an employer will reject a candidate when they see the SO Registry status.

I may go to the Sheriff’s office and run a “typical” employment background check - and see what it shows.

Sending death threats or cp isn’t just “dumb stuff” and the fact that you characterize it that way speaks volumes about your culpability and your character. If you truly want to fix this in any meaningful way then you need to start by being truly honest with yourself first and facing how you affected others.

You haven't ruined your life, and while your short term may be a little bit screwed up now, you absolutely have to get out of any negative headspace to make any progress.  I am a 23 y/o male now, but i got tossed in the clink for 6 months back in '21 for something I did when I was between 18 and 19 years old.  I went to junior college, stayed on the straight and narrow through probation and sex registrant therapy, and since I'm a tier 1 registrant in California, I've still got 7 and a half years to go unless I can get a retrial done.  The hardest part for me going through this process is knowing that I can't be honest with friends.  When I started this whole legal process, 3/4 of the people i was friends with in high school made up rumors and lies about me and cut me off, and as soon as I made some new ones in junior college one of them searched me up and I got exposed to the entire class.  Nobody wanted to talk to me, much less associate with me.  I have to keep my criminal record on the down low, because since then I've made a total of one single friend and I'm afraid he's going to drop me as well if he finds out.  It's really rough but fortunately I have help from my family.  If you do any online gaming or whatever, you could shoot a DM (I'm also looking for friends cause tbh it's Hella hard to make them right now) and I'd be happy to try to connect.  Good luck in learning to be stronger, it's a rough long and arduous road, but once you get a bit of mental clarity and finish dealing with therapy or a judge constantly, life opens back up again, I promise!",8,,2024-12-07 17:54:38,t3_1h8on8y,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1h8on8y/hello_im_new_now/m0wge14/

I can tell you from experience, that if you'll give Jesus Christ first place in your heart and in your life, you'll be an amazing new person.

Data analytics pays $65-70k per year to start, with top pay for data scientist at about $250-300k per year. Check it out. Cost to study at home and on your own time on computer or cell phone is $52.00 per month, and as much or as little as you want.  When you do a job interview, don't go into any details about your criminal conviction. I don't care what the HR manager or assistant says, it's none of their business: it's a weeding out trick. If they truly want to hire you, they'll do a background check anyway. Don't lie about your conviction, write only on the application that you'll ""discuss it in an interview only"". In the interview, say that you were convicted of XYZ offense and that you've learned XYZ from it and move on. Remember, you did not do this all your life since you were born; you're more than this. IF ANY COMPANY ONLY LOOKS AT YOUR OFFENSE AND DOESN'T CONSIDER ANYTHING ELSE: YOU don't want that position. Run away quickly from that company. Why???

NEVER TALK TO POLICE OR DETECTIVES; their not your friends.

If you do surrender, confess, and then the police let you go home: it's for one reason; to show up with TV cameras at your workplace or home and to arrest you on camera so that they can show taxpayers that their doing their job. Try it if you don't believe me. If you surrender & confess, don't leave, no point. Stay there in the jail until you speak to your lawyer & go before the judge.

Simply because he and all the other people involved in the situation have money and will be appealing laws and or conditions that are in place that are unconstitutional and illegal. Look SO's we're not allowed to have internet or social media access. It took one person to fight this condition and he bettered the situation for all of us. Polygraphs were used in an illegal manner and it took one law firm and one attorney to care about it and fight the law and now there are restrictions on the use of polygraphs. Foreign Nationals like myself I'm a US citizen but I am also a foreign national we're not allowed to move to another country if they were on parole for life. One person fought the case and won it for all of us. So imagine if every person fought one condition or law and had it changed or made it unconstitutional. Or perhaps nothing will change because these people are famous and will get special and more lenient conditions such as traveling for work like many other actors that got convicted of felonies and were on probation or parole.

There's two reports: 1) Combs engaged is sex trafficking of women and men across State lines, felonies per each instance. 2). Minor(s) were involved in some or one instance with Combs. 

If convicted, Combs will go to prison. Period. If the preponderance of evidence against Combs is enough to convince any jury, he's toast. 

As per sex registration laws; some have argued for and against it. The SCOTUS has affirmed its legitimacy in order to protect the welfare of the general public. I speak as a convicted sex offender. I do agree that after a person has served their time in prison AND has been on the registry for 10+ years; that the registration should stop. My debt is payed to Society. Period. But, the registration says otherwise. 

Eventually, I think that the registry laws will change, but not anytime soon. SORC was instituted by the Republican Party along with the Democrat Party under Bill Clinton and it was signed by Clinton, a known you-know. So, go figure. 

The USA is pretty unforgiving on sex offense. Theirs no community notifications for bank robbers, murderers, drug dealers, terrorists, insane individuals. Only sex offenses and arsonists.

Try as hard as you can to beat the stigma. To beat the system.

I committed my crime when I was 16. I acted against my victim a few times without knowing my consequences.

And I am placed on a registry. Sure.

[I told someone I can trust what I did. That I fucked up. And I get slammed for it. Whatever.

I just wish it was different. It's damn near impossible to provide for myself. I feel for those who have families.]

It's hell. Nobody will ever know without going through it. The system is corrupted.

Sure. Some people deserve to be on the registry. But some of us made a mistake. And to go through the shit would straighten us out real quick.

To get a job with a clean record is hard. With a record it's difficult. Some Sex Offenders don't get the luxury of family. Or friends. Or anyone.

Or if they do, all they think is they're out to get me.

It's never gonna be easy. For us.

I remember looking at the sex offender living next door to a handicap place. I remember thinking he was just gonna take advantage of them, being mental and all.

Or taking advantage of my sister.

Some people fuck up. Do we deserve to get punished for the rest of our life? Nah.

m0nbds2,comment,,"It depends on what your charge was. 

What is the registration applicability for an out-of-state offender?
A:	The registration process shall occur for an out-of-state offender if one of the following criteria are met:
An out-of-state offender shall be subject to sexual offender registration in Pennsylvania if he/she has been convicted of or court martialed for a comparable military offense or similar offense under the laws of another jurisdiction or foreign country that if it were committed in this Commonwealth, would require registration. i.e. – conviction of a similar offense enumerated under offender classification.


An out-of-state offender shall be subject to sexual offender registration in Pennsylvania if he/she has been convicted of, been adjudicated for or court martialed for a sexual offense in another jurisdiction or foreign country that is not set forth in under offender classification, but nevertheless requires registration under a sexual offender statue in the jurisdiction or foreign country. i.e. – is required to register as a sexual offender in another state.

This will always be met with positive feelings by observers. If you walk this walk others will respect you enough not to prey on you.

There will be cliques or groups who may try to extort you. If this happens you can either stand up to them (and get a beating) or check into PC protective custody (you'll get a jacket [bad rep]).

Many times extortion is unavoidable especially if your not a fighter or in great shape.

Or....if you have a useful skill like doing legal research for others trying to beat their case, then nobody will harm you as your are likely helping more well positioned inmates and that would spell a very bad moment for any future tormenters.",3,,2024-12-06 01:45:21,t3_1h78uwr,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1h78uwr/sentenced_to_6_months_in_ontario_canada_please/m0n0i7a/

Did you do any time pre-trial?

If not, basically what will happen is when you get there they will ask if you are GP (Gen Pop) or PC (Protective Custody). You can take your shot with GP if you want but if anyone finds out you are in for anything relating to sex crimes best case scenario they put you on the door (basically they tell you to get out) and you request PC. Worst case....well let's not even think of that.

Don't talk to the guards. They aren't your friends even if they are being 'nice' to you. Every range has a list of rules that you will have to read when you get there and one of the rules will be telling you to have a shower. Don't do ANYTHING until you read the rules and have a shower. If they are locked down when you get there your cellmate will tell you to do that first thing once you get out of cells.

Don't accept anything from anyone. Even if they try to tell you it's a gift, it isn't, just politely decline. Also don't gamble, you don't want to be in debt to anyone in there.

Moving to another country is going to be based on what sort of visa you are trying to get.  It appears you are going for retirement - so then it depends on how much money you get monthly/yearly.

The travel matrix also helps to figure out options because if you can't visit, you can't live there (although there are ways around that for some).

Now, admittedly, I haven't checked every nation, but every nation's retirement visa I've seen requires a guaranteed income. 

So, were you single, your proposed idea could work for being a nomad, as there are many countries you could go to for 90 days or a year visa free, then you move to the next, in a loop.

Some countries allow you to reset your tourist visa by just leaving for a couple hours. Go across the border and come back.

So a strict reading is from conviction date or incarceratio. Release date, regardless of where that has happened, and not 15 years from initial registration. I think this could be argued pretty successfully, but cant access any relevant case law at the moment.

m0gk9r8,comment,,"Depends on a lot of factors:


Conviction date

How far you are/were through your sentence

How long you’ve been on the registry

What county you’re in 

The reason that you are asking for removal

The crime that was committed

Whether or not there are physical victims who would contest it 

If the district attorney objects were not

If the sheriff objects or not



There have been many changes in the laws, so different people have different rules based on the date they were convicted and/or when they committed the crime.  Some people can apply immediately after finishing their sentence and some have to wait. The wait time varies, again, based on the date of conviction. 

I have read every single removal case that is publicly available that I’ve been able to get my hands on in the entire state.  Some counties seem to have a little rhyme or reason, other counties seem to have none. Some counties have refused every single one that I have found come up in the past 20 years. Some counties seem a little more open minded

Whether you can apply or not is up to the law based on the date that you committed the crime or the date of your conviction, depending on when those dates are.

Maybe get some cheap security cameras?  We had some issues w/ homeless people (not related to my SO-ness) and picked up some cheap $40 cameras, and they work really well.

You mentioned telling the investigating officers, but they're clearly not on YOUR side.  That's why I recommend the cameras.

In my case my offense happened 12 years ago and I served 5 years in prison and I'm 5 years out so usually they do a 3-year background check or a 5-year criminal background check so nothing shows up. But you don't have to be up front from the rip. I'm not saying to be dishonest but I'm just saying don't disclose any information unless you have to. Once you're on board you have a better chance of staying there then not having a chance at all. Perhaps and I know this is difficult you might consider moving to a different county or a place with more jobs or perhaps you can get some jobs like cutting grass shoveling snow that type of thing and save up for a car where you'll be able to have a bigger radius for a job search. Also in one of the comments was mentioned to ask your probation officer or parole officer ask him where his other clients work and perhaps you may be able to get a job in that field or that place.

m0fel5o,comment,,"Do you tell all these places off the bat you're a SO?  I did 5 years for receipt of CP 2012\~2017, and have had several food service jobs since then (chipotle and some restaurants).  I always leave the ""have you ever been convicted of a felony?"" question blank, and no one's ever asked about it.

I live in Las Vegas so it's obviously not a small town, and we have a zillion restaurants here.  My guess is that there's so many food workers here they can't possibly background check them all, especially with a lot of turnover.  So they just check your social media to see if you're nuts.  I always see my managers pop up on my facebook under the ""you may know these people"" right at the start.

So yeah, my recommendation is to not tell them if you don't have to.  If they ask why you left it blank, sure.  Though I'd still lie lol.  I told chipotle I did time for copyright infringement/selling copied games and movies or something.  I think the number of places that would hire you after being up front about being an SO is VERY low.

m0k16wl,comment,,"Hi there. Just completed 10 yrs of prob for one count (literally 1 video!) of poss CP, so I can 100% understand the frustration and anger and rollercoaster of emotions you are going through. Its tough, but you can make it through it.

As far as the job hunt goes, I have found that the best route is to check any box about background yes, but when it asks you to describe what happened, just write down you are willing to discuss in person. There are many people with criminal backgrounds, and this would help prevent HR from immediate exclusion because of your offense.

Now, if that gets you to an interview, here's the hard part: you have to be able to talk through what happened, and you have to be able to take accountability for your actions. Employers are willing to overlook a lot if the person shows they are sincere and want to rebuild their life afterward something like this. 

Now, the 1st few times I shared my situation, it was HARD - like choking up, almost in tears, the shame and embarrassment almost overwhelming. Here's how you get past that: practice it. Practice mock interviews with your family, where they toss you the normal questions, and then they ask you, ""so tell me about this criminal thing in your background?"" The more you practice, the better you will be in the real thing. BUT, you have to be genuine, you have to be sincere. People can read fake. You have to mean it, and your words have to say it. ""I know Ive made bad choices (not mistakes, thats a lack of responsibility), but Im looking for my path forward to rebuild my life in a positive and healthy way."" That kind of language makes a huge difference. And dont sugar coat things.

And then trust that the process can work. Use contacts from old jobs and see if anyone has opportunities. Like others said, use your PO as a resource. And if you need more help, we are here for you.",0,,2024-12-05 16:06:38,t3_1h6mzh8,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1h6mzh8/i_need_help/m0k16wl/

Also, background checks don't just check your 'criminal' history.  Nearly every employer that runs a background check will also do a sex offender registry check with it.  Regardless if your conviction is outside the range they check you're still going to show up on the registry.  

I'm a full supporter of being upfront with any company I apply to about my SOR status.  Why?

m17xf81,comment,,It's a difficult situation. If I'm not asked I don't mention it. I was hird pending a background check. I was hired 2 months before this store opened. I wasn't asked if I have any criminal offenses and I did not come forth stating that I have one. Like I said my conviction was in 2012 and I got the job in 2023. I was trained and when the store opened I started working on the location 2 months later. I know for a fact if I had told them I have a sex offender conviction that would not have hired me. I remained at this job for a year until I found a better opportunity. The reason I say not to disclose it is simply because once they train you they have invested money and time and training you. And it will cost them money to replace you with somebody else. I know when I was applying for new jobs I went to a similar company that was almost the exact same protocol as this one. I disclosed my situation and I never heard back from them. I will try to get my foot in there and risk the possibility or being dismissed at a later time then not get my foot in there at all. And if you say that you don't want to work for any company that will not hire rsos that covers about 90% of the available employment out there. And as for the free labor here in New Jersey they're obligated to pay you for training. So there's no free labor involved. It's just getting your foot in there and once you're in there they have invested money in you and I believe you have a better chance.

m0h806j,comment,,"That's a lot to unpack. I'll make my responses brief:

  
1. Court cases can take months or years to reach a conclusion. You can only wait for the outcome of that case. 

2. Those disclaimers are only of value if enforced, and they rarely are. You would only get relief from harassers if you're able to sue them but civil law is a whole different ballgame than criminal law. 

3. This same bill was introduced this year and went nowhere. However, I would suggest you keep an eye on this bill and if you're able to attend a legislative hearing on it and/or reach out to those on the committee in which it will be heard, I suggest you do that. You don't need to do more than explain how this will hrt you and anyone who may be connected to you. 

4. I can only suggest applying for disability and other welfare benefits while you can. No telling how long that is going to be available given the uncertainty of the incoming administration and his grand ideas for cutting welfare, but get it while you can get it. There are many attys that won't take pay unless they win your case, so get one if you need to. 

5. If you're that concerned iover you internet identifiers, Nebraska doesn't require them at all. There may be other states that don't either but I don't know which ones they are that the moment. 

As far as making friends, I can only say let folks get to know you before ever letting them know abiout your past, but don't go around anyone with kids even if you're offense didn't involve that because people think everyone on the registry is after their kids. So if it ever does come out, they will know you ain't like that. That's all I can add because I'm an introvert and I rather like having few friends.

In California you can open an S Corp without it being a C Corp so I am not sure what you are referring to.

I lost a client because I was an LLC due to contractor laws around LLCs.  Ever since then I have been a proponent of S Corps.

California doesn’t allow anonymous LLCs to operate in the state. 

California requires LLCs to file a Statement of Information within 90 days of approval, which lists the LLC’s members and becomes public record.

A single person can hold all executive positions in an S Corp. I use a registered agent to keep my paperwork up to date. It’s about $100 per year.

I have NEVER had someone look up my corp and turn down my services due to a corporate filing.

You can have an anonymous corporation - it happens all the time. People create an offshore corporation which then owns a US corp. I looked into it and the overhead made it cost prohibitive for me. Plus not sure if the legality. It’s a multi millionaires option AFAIK

m0lk7x2,comment,,"Your Google search has failed you. S-Corp is a federal tax designation. You cannot just go open an S-Corp. You either open an LLC or a Corporation then you file for the  IRS to designate it as an S-corp. 

You first have to have an LLC or a C-Corp then apply to use that tax designation. 

Not all business types have to have their LLC registered in the state they live in. I have two registered in a state I’ve never stepped foot in. 

Not everyone lives in California, I don’t. I don’t know where the OP lives either. Obviously you have to follow the laws in the state where you are operating.  However, even in CA, there are ways to operate an out of state, or even an out of country, LLC depending on certain factors (I do it every day, quite legally). Many, if not most, people can file their LLC in a state that allows anonymity. 

It makes not one tiny bit of sense why your clients would care how your business is taxed but people are strange and I have no idea what the requirement for every profession in every state is so I won’t argue that despite the fact I find it strange. 

Yes, one person can fill every “board” seat on an S-corp. That’s not the point. 

Absolutely everyone should contact a tax professional to see what’s best for their business structure, but an S-corp is still not a business designation, it’s a tax designation granted by the IRS. To get that tax desingation requires you to have an LLC or a C-Corp first. 

Regardless, telling someone to go file an S-corp instead of an LLC is like telling someone to tie their shoe when they’re wearing flip flops. 

Maybe this will help explain it to you, it’s the most simplified breakdown I could find.

m0kvl62,comment,,"Google search on differences. Again, check your local tax specialist

Whether an S corporation or an LLC is better depends on several factors, including the number of owners, the level of complexity, and the tax benefits: 

Formation: LLCs are generally less expensive and easier to form than S corporations. 

Reporting: LLCs require less reporting and are easier to manage than S corporations. 

Number of owners: S corporations have a limited number of owners, usually no more than 100, and all must be U.S. citizens or legal residents. 

Tax benefits: S corporations offer tax benefits like pass-through taxation, tax-favorable characterization of income, and savings on self-employment taxes. 
⬆️ this is huge for me

Liability protection: S corporations protect the personal assets of their shareholders. LLCs also offer personal liability protection. 

Eligibility requirements: S corporations must meet certain eligibility requirements, such as having an owner who is a US citizen or resident alien. 

Formalities: S corporations must hold regular meetings, maintain detailed records, and follow other formalities to maintain their status. 

Ownership flexibility: LLCs offer ownership flexibility. 

Stock: LLCs cannot issue stock, which may limit their ability to attract investors and grow the business.

IMO - You make it sound like having a C Corp is super complex. Apparently I wasn’t even aware that my businesses are C Corps because it’s all run through a registered agent. I’ve always referred to it as an S Corp.

Please review your LLC laws closely.

California has AB5 which is an independent contractor law. Multiple states are looking at it.

A” - being free from the hiring entity’s control, “B” - performing work outside the usual course of the hiring entity’s business, and “C” - having an established trade or business of their own to be considered an independent contractor; essentially, all three conditions must be met for someone to be classified as an independent contractor under this test.

Nobody has questioned it since I started a new company (C Corp?) and I moved to an S Corp. With your explanation, I should amend my answer that it’s the corporation part that matters, not that it’s an S Corp.

Edit: I was reading more articles about the AB5 law.  Apparently an LLC can help with getting around this independent contractor law also so now I’m totally lost. 🤷‍♂️",1,,2024-12-05 21:48:11,t1_m0lk7x2,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1h6f0nj/business_owner/m0lvm5t/
m0m17hy,comment,,"I don’t see how it’s possible to not know what type of business you have. The tax filings and requirements are vastly different.  Having a registered agent set it up doesn’t change that. 

Having a c-corp is far more complex than an LLC and relatively pointless for 98% of small businesses. 

I don’t know why you’re bringing up Independent Contractors, that has nothing to do with anything. The AB5 law concerns gig workers and, again, has nothing to do with any part of this discussion. 

I don’t know why you’re arguing about this.

m0er40p,comment,,Worst case scenario go to your local social services. In my state New Jersey if you go there with an eviction notice from your landlord and no job they are required to give you general assistance. You get a couple of hundred dollars in cash every month you get food stamps and you also get (tra) temporary rent assistance. Meanwhile while they're paying your rent and you have a couple hundred dollars in cash and some food stamps you can work off the books and continue to receive benefits or if you get a job that will give you one month or two for you to save up enough money to be able to afford to start paying rent again. I was fortunate enough to be financially independent when I got released from prison and I have a great landlord and I have a good job. However it took me hundreds of applications and dozens of interviews to land a job. I tried really hard and I kept at it and I have a job which which pays me well enough to pay my bills and even save some money and my landlord keeps my rent low because I help him out with the building. I don't think so difficult in your situation but you get out of life what you put into it. I have a friend who chooses to be homeless because she's too lazy to go find a job. Keep at it and hopefully you'll find a good job we are appreciated and the climate is not so toxic.

m0fcajd,comment,,"Sounds like a pretty crappy job regardless of your situation.  Have you looked at food service?  I did 5 years for receipt of CP, and when I got out in late 2017, I wasn't having much luck finding a job either.

I was in a halfway house and knew 2 other SOs that had gotten jobs at chipotle, so I knew they didn't care about backgrounds.  Not sure if they KNEW my friends were SOs, but we had to get forms signed by our boss acknowledging that we were in a HWH and stuff.  I told the place I applied to that I did time for copyright infringement/copying movies and games and they never really looked into it.  But I had \~4 years kitchen experience doing pretty much everything they do at chipotle lol, so I got hired.

After that I worked in a few restaurants and didn't tell them about my history, since by that time I had a year of chipotle experience.  Kitchens are VERY full of people that have done time.  I like dealing w/ people though so I started hosting, then moved to bussing.  It was a bit embarrassing because I was \~36 when I started working in restaurants, and all my coworkers were like 19.  Servers were older types, but for various reasons I didn't want to do that at the places I worked.  I wanted to move to barback but my last job screwed me out of that and reaaaaally pissed me off, so I quit.

It's very easy to move up and around in restaurants though.  So if you need to take it easy on your knee you could still do dishwasher or something, and then once better move to another position if you want.  Not sure if you live in a big town, but I'm in Las Vegas so there are a zillion restaurants.",1,,2024-12-04 20:27:24,t3_1h6gy5k,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1h6gy5k/please_read_released_in_sept/m0fcajd/

m0e9vak,comment,,"Yeah I got one, it's just one of those weird sketchy places that really only hires desperate ex cons it seems like. They do a weird 90 day probation where if you miss a shift for any reason, you're terminated. So at this point, to me it's just a toxic and stressful ass workplace, even more stressful than when I was in prison. So I think I'm just gonna bite the bullet, rest up for a couple of days and pray that this check magically comes in today of all days so that I know for sure rent is covered for 2 weeks, and then once I can walk without feeling shaky and in pain, I'll look for something more local and without that shitty, weird vibe, power trippy stink to it. Also I guess because an injury isn't technically discrimination, they can still can your ass and get away with it, and since I tried to be a good person and told the truth about it happening outside of work to my boss, I probably fucked myself on the ""legal coverage"" aspect

I think in my heart, I just really don't fucking like the job and my brain is looking for any excuse to quit and spend my time looking for a real job, this was just the first actual reason to take time off and do that that I've had. Honestly, I just want to be happy and I'll truly do anything to do that, whatever that takes. 🤷‍♂️. Tired of society and people trying to tell me how to live my life.

It's just the stress of being unsure financially and unsure of my housing situation, I've been homeless before due to messing up my life and I really don't want to go back to prison or the streets because I didn't want to work at a place that was telling me to work on a compromised leg and ""take it light"" then expect me to lift heavy industrial shit all day for 8 hours.

Which helps a lot. But I still have a little job to supplement my income and my life is affected very little to none with the fact that I'm an RSO. I was just having a conversation with my neighbor he just got off parole he's like I'm free I said I'm on parole and I'm free all they asked me to do at least here in New Jersey is don't commit any illegal acts and let them know when you're leaving the state and where you're going. And once you follow all the rules due to the fact that the overworked and understaffed they pretty much leave you alone. Now some parole officers are dicks and they'll do a little extra but overall to me the fact I'm on life  has no effect. I lead a normal life and I don't let this define who I am and Life goes on.

m0ijbxf,comment,,"Don't be afraid to ask for help, whether it's $$ or a place to stay or anything.  I have a friend I've known for \~15 years (not an SO), playing online games with.  A year or 2 ago he was in a rough spot.  He works in an amazon warehouse and had hurt his back.  He was working on getting worksman comp but in the meantime had to keep taking time hours off so he could physically work the next day.  And at one point it was too much and he didn't have enough for rent.  But he didn't tell anyone!

I only found out because I asked him about a game we play and he said he wasn't sure if he could play next month because he'd be on the street.  I told our other friends (who were in a better position $$-wise) and they were outraged he didn't ask, and immediately lent/gave him the $$.  I think he needed some from his sister the month after, but then he was back on his feet, mostly.

It was crazy, he only had flour in his apartment and was living off of basically homemade bread or whatever you can make with that.  Pride is an awful thing when it causes you to be kicked to the street rather than ask people that can and will help.

I tell people to think of what they'd do if the situation were reversed.  If you were doing well and your parents had fallen on hard times, would you help them out?  I knew people in jail that didn't want to ask their friends/family for help either, and would just suffer when they'd really love some snacks or a book sent in or something.

I had noooooo problem asking for $$ lol, because like I mentioned, if our situation were reversed I'd help out all I could.  I actually had a friend in prison for insider trading, and his people weren't being very helpful (other than sending him $$).  So I would print out the stuff he was looking for and send it in (sheet music), google stuff for him, and anything else like that he didn't want to bug his family about.",2,,2024-12-05 09:24:01,t1_m0fnqou,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1h6gy5k/please_read_released_in_sept/m0ijbxf/
m0nr03j,comment,,"You are definitely one of the real ones, man, that's for sure. Those things are priceless inside. Good books, things you enjoyed out there, a little piece of yourself in that bleak world, whew.. it's worth everything.

Anyways, I know, I try to set it aside when I really need it, but the only people in my life, seriously, that can help out financially are my Mom and stepdad. They came into some money about 2 years ago, still have a decent chunk due to just living cheap and still working, and they supported me all through prison.

I had hoped on getting out, landing a job the first day I'm out, obviously, and one that pays $25 an hour, and pay my parents back and save money and get my own place and blah blah blah.... Then life kicked me in the nuts, and then it did the exact same thing that happened to your friend to me.

My knee was so bad I worked a full 8 hour day on my feet, left the house at 4:15 AM, and didn't get home to sit down until 9:30 PM. Came home literally dragging my leg, shooting pain from my knee all the way to my heel, couldn't put any weight on it. Went into work the next day feeling better but still hurting bad, and within the first 2 hours I was limping pretty bad and they're just watching me take down 85 LB car rims FOR ""LIGHT DUTY"" because of my injury...

That's when I said y'know what dude, this shit is worse than prison!! I want to kill myself and I hate my life, and this job pays so shitty I literally have like $100 for the week after paying rent. Like shit! What happens when it breaks or tears all the way or whatever, are they gonna pay my rent, medical costs, surgery, etc? And then I'm partially disabled in my right leg my whole life with a noticable limp? Nah. I'll roll the dice and try to find a local restaurant job, or better yet somewhere that doesn't force you to work for scraps when you're injured and others are visibly, purposefully not doing their jobs for hours at a time, then come gripe at me when I do something wrong. Yet they, these supposed supervisors, have barely shown me the proper way to do anything. They themselves weren't even shown so I can't even be mad at them lmao.

Sorry for the vent, if you read all that. Long story short, it's a toxic workplace, if I continue to work there I will be injured severely long term, maybe not this time but next time. Work conditions there are literally no PPE and no safety briefings, and with language barriers too... Yeah. OSHA nightmare. 

People take risks, quit their jobs, or get fired over stupid shit every single day. I hurt my knee due to a stupid injury, and the stress from that, compacted with release from prison and the 6 months of stress before release, and just life in general... Yeah, explains why I'm having a mental fucking breakdown lol.

Gonna go seek treatment at a walk in mental health place down the road, and once the weekends over and my knee is better I'm gonna go apply like crazy at a place that isn't everything I described above and more.

If anyone is struggling to find work Alsco uniform company will hire you. That is currently where I work. They don't do a background check but they do do a drug test to start. Also LIUNA is a union for construction laborers. They have apprenticeships in pretty much every state. It's a earn as you learn program. Look up your local liuna and check out the apprenticeship. If you don't mind doing construction it's a good program. You get so many different certs. I just got my Scaffold builder cert. I hope this helps. I'm glad I found this group on reddit.

m0ibyk9,comment,,"When I first got out and was dealing with some serious mental health issues and completely broke, I tried to go to a local university that offered low-cost/free therapy. You would see a therapist that was not yet licensed, being overseen by a licensed therapist at the same time- so both were in the session. I had no problem with this, as I truly just needed the help. In the first- and only- session, I was asked about incarceration, which I admitted to having just been released. The following was the question about what I was incarcerated for. I was honest, as I felt they should know any and everything that was potentially part of my severe depression, anxiety, and so on. I was immediately told that they would not be able to continue any further due to my past history, and that was that. Talk about traumatizing just having that happen when you’re trying to just get some mental health help!
That was many years ago, and now- having obtained a degree in Developmental Psych, and grad school studying developmental psych as well as addiction/recovery….. I cannot see how in the world the therapist as well as the student therapist that sent me on my way could have done so without any regard to my wellbeing whatsoever. I could potentially understand if there was some legality to the situation, but nonetheless, I would have more respect for that/them if they had checked with me in that session to simply make SURE that I was ok/safe, and that I wasn’t a danger to myself or anyone else- but they didn’t even do that. 
This is not to say that you SHOULDN’T tell a therapist, or a doctor anything about your legal history…. In fact, even after what happened to me in that session, I made CERTAIN that I was upfront with the therapist I saw after that, and therapists down the road, because honestly- I don’t want a therapist to work with me on the hard stuff mentally, if they’re too quick and ready to just send me on my way without a care in the world.

m0327ks,comment,,"It’s complicated, but the answer is almost always no. I’ve found a couple of cases where the people were bedridden/invalid with no hope of recovery where they allowed it, but nothing else. Even people under 18 have lost those cases and their appeals when trying to live with their parents.  

Attorney probably can’t answer your questions without extensive research. 

Grandfathering is typically done when a law changes and a person was convicted before that law changed or a place you purchased or rented was compliant when you rented it then they built a school within the boundaries. It is not typically given when someone lived somewhere and then committed the crime and the law already existed.  

If you are on probation and don’t have a place to live then they have the choice of allowing you to be homeless or incarcerating you. They’re not apt to make an exception for anyone who simply can’t find a place. Some states allow probationers to be homeless, others incarcerate them. NY has a few different alternatives to incarceration. I don’t know how they work, I believe they are called OPCA and ATI. I don’t know if RSO’s qualify for them or not but you could look at them and see. 


Probation is an alternative to being incarcerated. Typically, when you can’t follow the rules of probation, you get incarcerated.

Because of mandatory minimums, he was looking at a minimum of 55 years in prison if convicted on all counts (1-2 counts for each file) and the PA said she’d add more counts if he took it to trial. The main problem is that a jury would not know about the mandatory minimums. They might think, well, he was snooping around stuff he shouldn’t have been and deserves a hand slap, not realizing he’d spend his life in prison. Mandatory minimums are a huge problem. Judges and juries should be able to sentence based on the facts of the case, not some arbitrary sentence set by someone who doesn’t know this case, this defendant.

I think that, if you are guilty, taking a negotiated plea is much smarter than trial or a blind plea. I’ve read and seen a lot lot lot of cases. I’ve seen a whole lot of people offered 5 or 10 years, then take it trial and get 25 to life.

But the lawyer we had basically convinced him that the plea deal was the best he could hope for without ever even telling him that he could negotiate it. Not to mention, the detective on the case was dead set on “proving” that he was guilty (and even got promoted shortly after his initial arrest). And that’s not even taking into account the fact that we live in a small rural southern town and it was an election year, so naturally the DA had something to prove to ensure they kept their position. So maybe it would’ve been a risky gamble, but I honestly think it would’ve been worth it given the severe depression and anxiety that I see my partner suffering through every day now. We have three kids and he wanted to be a dad his whole life. And not being allowed to be there for all of their school functions absolutely breaks his heart and mine.

I wound up doing 5 of 6 years for receipt, and pretty much everyone else in our SO group in prison took their plea deal, the ones that had possession/receipt stuff anyway.  I knew 1 or 2 guys that fought it and they wound up spending 10-20k and didn't get any less time, think they had 8-10 years.

Do you have a lawyer or public defender?  Your lawyer would (should) be MUCH more knowledgeable than any of us here.  They'll know the prosecutor and judge and know what your chances are.  When my lawyer went over my plea deal with me, I asked him what I should do and he said he couldn't TELL me what to do.  So I asked him what he'd do in my place, and he said he'd take the deal.

Our state removed the ""knowingly"" clause for possession and changed it to ""willfully"". The state court of appeals has found that even if you didn't see, open, or know that you had possession of these images, you can still be found guilty by ""willfully"" allowing yourself to be exposed to this type of material; i.e. if someone emails you an attachment, you open it, and you realize that it's scam after you open it. Even if you delete it and report the email, you can still be charged and convicted for ""willfully""  opening the email attachment, even if you didn't know what it was until after you opened the attachment. And they can consider it possession since, even if you immediately delete it after realizing what it was, you had the ""ability"" to copy, save, and manipulate it in other ways. ",1,,2024-12-07 17:58:02,t1_m01qsyt,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1h4xf21/do_you_regret_taking_a_plea_deal/m0wh0st/

I really wanted to fight; it's a complex situation to explain, and I won't (except to attorneys and friends.)

lzz566i,comment,,"Well, I’m a bit of an oddity, so keep that in mind. I was in IT prior to my offense and in grad school for IT at the time of my arrest. Somehow I managed to keep both my job and grad school going through the conviction process and into therapy. This also is now 26 years behind me now. 

I was very fortunate to be employed through three different companies the past 26 years and have been working up the career ladder. Now days i advise a company that I’m assigned to through the company I work for. Basically I’m a subject matter expert. I won’t go too deeply into here to help protect my job, but if you want more direct information feel free to pm me. 

As for the IT career. I have another friend from the program who works 💯 remotely and makes a very good income as a programmer. I’m not a programmer, but more infrastructure which are different disciplines in the same industry. 

If your son has an aptitude for this type of work and he’s allowed to pursue it, it IS a good career. The challenge he’ll have is the same as everyone here. He could be the perfect candidate for any job, but the offense will trip him up. He will have to work that much harder, apply that many more times and be absolutely tenacious in going after jobs. Never not apply for a job because he might not think he could get hired there. Make them say no. If he doesn’t apply then no is the default.

Not gonna let someone with my restrictions (no unmonitored computer access) work there. 

Now, that's several factors: the conditions of my supervised release, the fact that I'm a fed case in the first place, the sentencing district, how the district I'm doing my time in interprets my conditions, and where I'm at in treatment.

1. Went to inpatient rehab within weeks of being charged.
2. Attended multiple SAA meetings per week and kept an attendance log book.
3. Started individual therapy at VA
4. Weekly individual sex addiction therapy with a private therapist.

My SAA groups wrote a large number of letters of support, including several who had gone to prison.

Lastly, its an uphill battle to live at home during parole if their are minors present, let alone the victim. I went in front of the judge to get a probation order rescinded so I could be with my kids. One person in my SOTP program was living with his victim.",2,,2024-12-02 11:35:44,t3_1h4i92t,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1h4i92t/does_therapysaa_help_reduce_charges/m00s71n/

Once you take care of yourself then you can deal with the people around you. Go to work talk to your boss explain to him the situation and what's going on. They may want to hire you on. Don't go to the temp agency just show up to your job and grab your supervisor and explain the situation to him. The only thing is that if they do choose to hire you they have to pay something or a penalty to the temp agency. Offered to pay for whatever would cost them to hire you from the temp agency. Be honest with your employer tell him you're a hard worker and you made a mistake and now you're trying to be a productive law abiding citizen. Keep keep putting in those indeed applications.

The store manager told the owner of the store who spent the money to check out his background. It seems there was an open charge of kidnaping still there.   He was never formally charged for that, only arrested for it. So they left him go because he was not 100% honest about his past.  He explained that he did not even know of this charge.  His PO agreed with him that it was not a charge. But nobody removed it from hus record.

Plus, you have to have other requirements prior to seeking admission. Since, his work was with humans, you need X amount of time with animals prior to admittance.

This is for A&M in Texas:

**Animal experience** includes caring for and handling animals in a kennel or animal shelter. It also includes any other experience that was not under the direct supervision of a veterinarian, such as FFA and 4-H projects.

**Veterinary experience** is hours spent working under the direct supervision of a veterinarian, whether in a paid or volunteer capacity in a clinical or research environment. ***Applicants must have more than 100 hours worth of veterinary experience in order to qualify for an interview.***

It is hard to get this completed since he is an RSO. I have been blocked because many animal shelters here have a blanket policy against any RSO due to partnering programs they have with schools and children.

To the original post:

The more visibility you have in the public, the better it pays off in the long run. Trying to volunteer for organizations might be the place to start and then use the connections you make might help you enter a better position later on. Many graduate programs that are professional degrees require some sort of license. It's best to talk to your potential professors about if they can help you get into programs while you are in graduate school. They have connections that might be able to help you. so, while you are in graduate school, you are also working in the field and this will show positivity since your conviction and duty as an RSO, that in time, potential employers may be more lenient.

Participate in the university programs and events. All this will help you make connections that will help you later on.  You could always consider finance. You can work in the field and a license isn't always required. I am sure medicine has a lot of math involved.

So, Step 1 would be to talk to the program directors that you are interested in and see if the program will work out due to your situation.",2,,2024-12-03 15:42:41,t1_lzxuo3u,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1h4b1m3/jobscareer_ideas_in_which_a_rso_could_use_a/m07pqr4/

Everyone here in Vegas/NV has to go to SO therapy after prison, group weekly and 1 on 1 sessions that get less frequent over time.  I felt like I didn't really need group myself, but it was nice to be able to (eventually) use my experiences to help other people.  This reddit reminds me a lot of group.

1 on 1 was very helpful though, and my therapist helped me figure out why I got into CP in the first place.  But there were people in group that had similar issues to what you have, social stuff.  I'm not a psychologist or anything, but you sound a lot like my friend who has depression.  He's a big gamer, but sometimes he'll just go lie down and watch YT instead of playing all the games I know he wants to play.  When I asked him why he's just lying there he said it's a depression thing where he just doesn't feel like doing anything

Finding a better job might help too.  I didn't even like working 30 hours a week lol.  I like having free time to relax and do stuff.  What are you doing for work?  I've been working in food service since I got out.  Chipotle and restaurants.  Hosting definitely requires a lot of talking to people, but dishwashing and bussing didn't.  Well, bussing depends on the restaurant.  I LIKE dealing w/ people though, so I liked the one where we greeted them and got their drink order.  The last restaurant I worked at, bussers didn't do any of that, or didn't have to anyway.  Our main job was just cleaning up after they left.  I've seen plenty of coworkers that were bad socially, and others that would stop and chat with tables all the time.

As far as I can tell, food service doesn't do background checks either.  Tons of kitchen workers did time, and I'm tier 2 and had no issues getting into restaurants.  There's also room to move around if you want more $$.  It depends on where you live too I guess.  Tons of restaurants here in Vegas.

Your decision to invest in therapy, pursue higher education, and build a professional life on your own terms is nothing short of inspiring. Starting a Master’s program and navigating the complexities of employment in such a strategic way speaks volumes about your determination and resourcefulness.

I have to say, in all my years, I’ve never heard of anyone being allowed to leave the country while on probation. That’s remarkable and shows how much the court must have trusted you to take such a bold step. It’s a testament to your dedication to change and growth.

Your story is such an important reminder that the past doesn’t have to define the future. Thank you for sharing your journey and for encouraging others to keep striving for better. The work you’ve done—and continue to do—will undoubtedly inspire others to stay strong and believe in their ability to change. Wishing you nothing but continued success as you move forward!

There are laws where you can be arrested and charged if you leave your children alone with him. 

You won’t win the custody battle. If you do, because you’re both lied or hidden it, I am certain there will be a stipulation that you cannot have them around him. And if that’s broken, you’ll lose them again quickly.

Just listening to your description of his situation, you sound like you're still in the lovestruck denial phase of reality. There's a lot of blame taking place, either against the ex, the victim, or the legal system, but all taking away from the accountability of the person you love. The story you get from your partner and the public records is only ever a fraction of the truth. It's easy to regurgitate it because it's what you want to believe and it's what he wants you to believe, but it doesn't put your better judgement and intuition into the safest place and the court system will see right through that. 
I will say this, progress will not start until there is ownership, accountability, and ongoing active recovery underway. Does he acknowledge his lapse of judgement and what led him there mentally rather than just saying it was a setup? Does he attend group therapy and preferably also private therapy? Do you have a safety plan in place and read all of his restrictions so you can help make the right choices or are you just trusting him to tell you what he can and can't do? Is he actively trying to better himself or is he still stuck in the whoa is me mindset? 
I just don't want to see you fall into some kind of trauma bonded co dependent attachment to a person just because he's kind and gets you because this will likely result in you losing your children and cost you your own rights that go along with a lifetime registration.

As a general rule of thumb, it's best to play it safe and keep your kids away from a RSO. They may very well be no risk whatsoever to them, however in many cases, it's a probation violation, and it could almost certainly be used in court to make you look like an unfit parent, regardless of whether or not they pose any risk to the kids.

You're gonna have to ask yourself a really tough question, can you live apart while being together until your children are 18? And any possible future children? Two completely separate households..lives...relationships. it's hard, and you have to think of this as a protecting him but also the most important part your children. 

Mine is required to register for 20+ yrs yadda yadda, he did 4 yrs in jail (this happened almost 10 yrs ago). I've read over all his court stuff, talked to his attorney, I also worked for a crim def attorney for years so I didn't just look at one side. I've known him long enough and deep enough to know he'd never do anything to my children BUT I also know that the charges are rough and he alford pled, and I wasn't there so I have to protect my children more just to be safe. Regardless what I *think*. 

Don't let him around your children, not because of what he might do, but because he legally cannot be there. If he gets put into a position like that and is caught now his life is even harder, your life is harder, and then your children are gone too. 

I love mine and I would walk fire for him, but I would walk the world on fire for my children and he knows that and expects that. We don't EVER and I mean EVER mix the 2, my life with my kids is completely separate from my life with him, they do not know he exists and I mean that, I am only with him when they're over an hour away.

m08abaq,comment,,"Reading this (and all comments) was rough. I’m the wife of an RSO and it’s tough. I was with him before he took his plea deal so I knew what was up before I married him and it’s still tougher than I could have imagined. I’m not even a parent yet, but I literally cannot imagine not having my children and doing anything to jeopardize my relationship with my kids. I’m sorry your ex husband is not a great person and is rough to deal with, but unfortunately that’s your life right now. I know how hard it is to date and find someone you feel really gets you. I get that you want to make it all work, but realistically how do you see this playing out? Is it worth losing your kids? Based on what I’ve read, that’s almost a guarantee if you stay with this man and while your ex-husband may be a POS, I don’t really disagree with how he’s handling this. How much money was drained from his account that would be worth all these lies (and not one person veering from the story)? Can you confirm he was in the armed forces? I met a man years ago who told lie upon lie about being in the service and all sorts of other lies about his life so I always get wary when that’s a part of the story. I know there are true service members dating and who have crazy things happen to them, but all of these elements of your bf’s story woven together just seem a little too fantastical.",2,,2024-12-03 17:31:01,t3_1h3vsdv,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1h3vsdv/bf_is_a_rso_i_need_support/m08abaq/

lzvh8q8,comment,,"His charge was Attempted Carnal Knowledge of a minor. Thats on paper.. what happened was he served two deployments, the woman he was with and cheated on him while he was deployed got pregnant by the other guy, she was trying to repair their relationship just to get access to his money. He failed for it and she had a coworkers 16yr old daughter say they had sex to get him put in jail. First they said it was rape, then it was consensual, then it was back to rape again. The original charge was two accounts of rape, they dropped it to one account, then they said they can drop it down to contributing to a delinquency. When he agreed to the contributing to a delinquency they changed it to attempted carnal knowledge of a minor. He served 5yrs and while he was in jail his ex drained his bank accounts, ran up his credit cards, wrecked and sold his truck, and got rid of all of his stuff. Hes been out of jail for 3yrs. Hes not on probation. He has checked with the officer that he has to reregister with every year on me living with him. Right now im between living with my stepmom and staying with my dad. I only ever stay at the boyfriends house once a week or so. But the officer said as long as its an adult living with him and the kids dont spend the night and if the kids are fully supervised by the mother (me) then hes not violating anything. We did go to one of my kids football games but midway through the game i texted him if he may be violating his RSO terms. He said he was with me the entire time and i was supervising him, that everything would fine. Thats what im afraid of with him being put in jail. I texted him while he was sitting next to me to not bring attention to us. My kids have only ever met him while my dad and i were present. So with all of that said, he is on the very low end of everything. He showed me all of his papers and theres nothing that states what he did. He also never had to give dna and doesnt have to be tested yearly.

lzxa2nr,comment,,"The law stating he cannot be at places like that has been in place for at least 20 years. It was literally a felony for him to be there. 

Tennessee absolutely requires DNA (though, again, I’m not sure why it would be that big of a deal or change anything.) 

The thing is, you can say you’re just friends. If your ex asks, I almost guarantee you they will put in a stipulation that your children cannot be around him.  

Standard Tennessee custody orders state that you can’t have overnight opposite sex guests, and the law prohibits him from spending the night under the same roof, I know you’re not doing that now - but how will a relationship work like that if your goal is marriage and having a baby? I’m not saying it can’t, but I’d think about it. You can’t get married, live together, and have your kids.  You can’t even have him around your kids and leave the room without the possibility of both of you being arrested. You could potentially obtain an exception to that, but it takes about 2 years , it’s unlikely since his victim is a minor, and it will cost you a fortune. And you’re not going get it if their dad doesn’t agree to it. 

He will never legally be able to go to any school, any kids sports events, parks, playgrounds, pools, hotels with pools, etc… as long as he’s on the registry here. Jobs are scarce because there are proximity laws for those too. 

It’s $250 to register in each county each year. If you visit another county for more than 48 hours (say you live in Knoxville and want to spend a week in Nashville, he has to register in Nashville). 

I volunteer in reentry in TN & GA. It is nearly impossible to find jobs and housing if you’re in any of the bigger cities. 

He has to register his car and any other car he drives. Tennessee uses ALPR’s (automatic license plate readers) to notify them if a RSO is near a place that they’re not supposed to be.

My guy and I swapped cars for a day recently because he needed to pick up a large item that wouldn’t fit in his car. I didn’t think anything of it despite the fact that I was going to a park. 

I was there about an hour and, thank God, I was standing there and knew the officer that showed up because I’m not sure they’d have believed he wasn’t there somewhere. I doubt they show up every time. It could’ve been some wild coincidence. But I doubt it. 

TN is not a state to eff around with. Go browse the registry and look at how many people have registry violations listed on their record. 

You stand to lose a lot (primarily your children) by being in this relationship. I’m not exaggerating or attempting to fearmonger, that’s just the reality of it and I think you need to know that.",5,,2024-12-01 20:18:40,t1_lzx3b2l,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1h3vsdv/bf_is_a_rso_i_need_support/lzxa2nr/

It is a crime for her to leave her children under his supervision - I mean even to run to the grocery store. It is a crime for him to stay the night under the same roof. 

Sure, she can consult a family attorney. They will tell her the same thing because it isn’t what a judge may or may not decide, it is what the LAW says. 

Are there ways to fight that?

I don’t know if you’ve ever prosecuted someone for a sex crime, but I have. I was a grown adult when I did it and it’s one of the most traumatic things I’ve ever experienced.  It was worse than the crime itself was. I had 5 or 6 full interviews. I had to draw diagrams, I had to have forensic tests, I had to describe everything in great detail, it’s just not as simple as reporting someone, they arrest them and they take a plea without going through all of that. 

It’s extreme, it’s a lot, I don’t see how any 16 year old coworkers kid could be that dedicated to a lie. I’m not saying it’s impossible or never happens, but they don’t generally charge people without having enough evidence. Cases like that go to a grand jury, 12 regular citizens have to decide if there’s enough evidence to show the person is guilty. That’s one of the biggest reasons we have to go through all the interviews. 

People may lie in the beginning, but I don’t see how a 16 year old girl could or would go through all of that when there’s definitely nothing in it for them.",5,,2024-12-01 20:28:55,t1_lzx2aty,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1h3vsdv/bf_is_a_rso_i_need_support/lzxc3b5/

His ex doesnt have her kids, his stepsister has the kids now, and they all have new cars. All bought within the time his bank accounts and credit cards were drained.

1. They definitely would’ve looked in to someone selling kids. 

2. Unless her name was on the accounts, she would’ve committed a massive number of felonies, why wouldn’t he have had her arrested? 

3. Why would he do time / take a plea and not mention *any* of that? 

4. How much money? Around $20-30k? That’s about what an attorney would cost. I’d bet money that’s where the money went. 

This is one of the least realistic stories I’ve heard. I know people can be convincing, but from an outside perspective - the chance of this being true is like 0.00001% (note that I am making up a number for illustrative purposes and it’s not an actual figure). 

It’s true that if you’re married he becomes a parent *if certain conditions are met* but your ex can, via court order and/or a judge, still prohibit you from having the kids around him which would mean that you’d have to stay elsewhere when you had your children.

Apparently the police determined she was the primary aggressor. 

I've known lots of men who went to jail, even one for taking a knife away from his wife, and she admitted she had a knife and everything. 

DA took it all the way to trial, started cross examining witnesses and everything before motioning for a dismissal.

9/10 the man goes to jail, and if he doesn't it's usually because he curled up in a ball while the woman was beating him.

Still, if people are so concerned with pedos being around (to the point they want to kill them for just existing), they should be trying to find ways to give these people ways to manage these attractions in a healthy way.

Many of these people seem smug in their position and probably will go out their way to hurt anyone they suspect fall into their mindset of what their bumper sticker says without thinking about the consequences. More laws are being made and it appears that the media and others are making RSO/PFO not only the same as the P word but they are making it that these people are so strong, need to be controlled and cannot be changed that everyone should just focus on them. Neverminded that many of the communities have worse issues going on. However, here is a boogeyman. 

 If you look around you will find that the rise of attacks are on-going and many people who will not do their research and immediately default to the lowest denominator use this as a weapon for anything they do not want to understand. There is more concern now due to the new administration that are coming in with various accusations/investigations following behind them that I believe may be causing confusion because these people have not faced ""justice"" and some of these people make the laws against RSO.

NY, the federal restriction on all felons owning firearms is unconstitutional and can only be applied when the crime specifically involved a firearm to restrict that person's right to own.

If you are speaking in a broader sense of just a pardon, you can petition the White House. Presidential pardons for federal conviction is a process - but fair warning you'd be in a list with death row inmates and thousands of other people. Odds are not in your favor based on sheer numbers, and then add in your type of offense and the political optics (which is all that a pardon really is nowadays)...

lzseyno,comment,,"It makes perfect sense, yes. 

The law is written unclearly enough that the GBI will typically not give you an answer to that question. They leave it to the counties to enforce and decide. 

You are not required to register while here. Unless you commit a crime and are arrested or pulled over while visiting there’s no reason anyone would know you’re registered. 

The law would insinuate that, since you aren’t required to register here, you would not have to follow the residence or proximity restrictions. But it’s up to the Sheriff and DA to interpret that *if you get arrested* 

So, how likely are you to get arrested? 

NARSOL was here this year. Everyone stayed in a hotel with a pool and I’m sure there was other crap nearby.

It was in North Carolina circuit court but the supreme Court ruled on it. In addition there was a law passed that polygraphs can only be used under certain circumstances regarding RSO's.

m091igc,comment,,"“Probationers and parolees do not enjoy “the absolute liberty to which every citizen is entitled.” Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471 (1972). In general, special conditions of probation are valid if they are reasonably related to the defendant’s crime and rehabilitation. G.S. 15A-1343(b1)(10); State v. Johnston, 123 N.C. App. 292 (1996). Applying a similar analysis, courts across the country have generally rejected lifetime bans on all internet access as a condition of supervised release, see United States v. Duke, 788 F.3d 392 (5th Cir. 2015) (collecting cases), but have often approved internet restrictions limited in time, United States v. Paul, 274 F.3d 155 (5th Cir. 2001) (3 year ban), or scope, United States v. Miller, 665 F.3d 114 (5th Cir. 2011) (internet access permitted with probation officer approval). Courts have upheld requirements for a probationer to share social media passwords with their supervising officer, e.g., People v. Ebertowski, 228 Cal. App. 4th 1170 (2014), but whether an outright ban would survive a First Amendment challenge appears to be an open question—especially after Packingham, given the Court’s view of the central importance of social media in modern life.”

m097x7o,comment,,I'm sorry to hear that. (Sorry about the social media not that you're off parole happy about that)To be honest I couldn't care less about social media. Never had Facebook in my life until I became an RSO. And I did that just because I could. I never very rarely use Facebook or any other social media. However if I'm entitled to use then I will. I don't fight every battle I chose my battles. At least I try to. But in this case the ruling applied to me so I brought it to my parole officer's attention and he told me I can . When I was asked to take a polygraph I simply pleaded the fifth amendment. The polygrapher said that he was going to send a note to my parole officer that I complied and I used the fifth amendment right against self-incrimination as afforded to me by the Constitution of the United States of America as an American citizen. I was never asked to take a polygraph again. I have been on parole for 5 years and have never been polygraphed.,2,,2024-12-03 20:23:35,t1_m08ugcs,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1h3iy16/any_new_laws_nyc/m097x7o/

m096ynm,comment,,I'm aware of the case law I just broke it down to the basics. They can be special conditions but you can fight them. That is the problem with what's going on with rsos. They get the condition the follow it without fighting it. If you accept what you're told as a given by a parole officer or even a parole board without fighting it I think it's a mistake. That is in most cases. I didn't even have to fight it. I wrote a letter sighting the case law and my parole officer immediately granted me access to social media. However my crime was not an internet crime. But even in those cases it has to be reasonable and also has to be related to the crime. Regardless the point that I'm trying to make is there are more and more laws being passed or overturned as time goes by because simple individuals just decided to fight it.

Be vocal on your distain of the current system.   Insofar as you and he are comfortable share the most ridiculous parts.  Talk to neighbors,  family,  friends,  and legislators.

If you can reach out to him and explain to him that he's welcome to stay with you guys and continue to be your roommate would be amazing. If he doesn't pick up your calls contact his aunt.

Somebody on my job ran my name ( in Google )I'm no longer on the registry cuz I'm tier one in New Jersey but started making an issue of it. I pulled him on the side and I told him if he didn't fucking cut the shit off I would sue him for harassment. I explained to him that the list is not there for people like him to harass people like me but for other reasons. And what he was doing it was a violation of love I made him up in prison. Needless to say he shot up real quick. I'll have the ability to leave this country because I'm doing national and I also have the financial ability to have my Google results pushed back. So when somebody googles me they will not see the crime I committed. Or I can just change my name. But I refuse to do any of the above.

lzrapc4,comment,,"New Jersey may be a good choice. If he's not under any restrictions or parole I don't see what the where the problem would be. She can move anywhere he wants whenever he wants or he has to do is register according to the states requirements. I am not a lawyer and I would suggest that you consult with an attorney. I'm very sorry for the civil commitment usually they don't want to release people because for example here in New Jersey they get $50,000 per inmate State Prison and $250,000 for every civil committed person. So it's a money making business. However in my humble opinion once he's released he can travel and go wherever he wants or he has to do is register according to the state's requirements. Does she even have to register? Hasn't he been registered for 20 years as to where he was residing. You need to find out what the laws are in PA regarding this matter. If he has registered for 20 years he may be able to get off the registry. Regardless it is commendable that you and your husband want to help this individual. God bless you and good luck to you.

lzrp8ve,comment,,"Hmm,  I honestly hadn't thought about the possibility of housing across the bridge in Jersey.  Thank you!! It's a little further, but depending on their requirements vs. PA, it could be an option. 

With his upbringing, he took on that gang type mentality and was involved in some dumb things in his 20s.  So, he had a criminal record prior to the sex offense. He just wasn't interested in being a good guy back then.  But he's not a young 20 something year old guy anymore, and we believe he has matured and changed, and I dont believe he would even think about engaging in that type of lifestyle now. My husband and I were lucky to have left that behind when we joined the military and avoided being mixed up in a life of crime or poverty. He made a lot of bad mistakes, but we understand that lifestyle and how he ruined his life so bad. He knows too and takes responsibility for his past, so we're ready to be here for him.  

And yeah, many people don't even know about those institutions like the one he's at. It's honestly sick. People who have committed murder have spent less time in confinement than he's had to...all for government greed/money. He served his time and completed the necessary programs, etc, so he doesn't deserve to spend the rest of his life there and die in that place. 

Thanks again for the NJ tip. I'll definitely have to look up the information on registry requirements, too, because I wasnt aware there was a time limit, but with his SVP/Tier 3 designation, I'm just guessing, but he may be permanently forced to register.",1,,2024-11-30 20:56:51,t1_lzrapc4,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1h2stl4/philadelphia_temporary_housing/lzrp8ve/

It's a long shot, but I hoped someone would see my post and have firsthand knowledge of someplace specific or know of someone who rents rooms or something short term that's furnished or at least partial furnished and wouldn't have an issue with an RSO leasing from them.

lzpnwkz,comment,,"Thank you, I'll check that out. 

And yes, he was actually 'released' to the SVP program that's run by the S.C.  department of mental health (where he's currently located).

He was incarcerated in 1996 and then committed to the state run institution upon his release and has been held there indefinitely ever since. Now that his brother (my husband) has been involved and is willing to sponsor his release and basically take responsibility for him, they've been hinting that his release may be in the works.  We honestly don't know if he'll EVER be released or if he might be let out next month.  It's kind of crazy and we just want to be fully prepared. 

But anyway, long story short, since it's been like 20 years since his actual incarceration, he isn't under any legal restrictions of any sort other than the registry required by the state he resides in.

In the event he is released, we just want to keep him safe, and in compliance with any registration rules and as near to us as possible for whatever period of time it may be until we purchase our house. I've honestly thought about just basically keeping him with us until/if the landlord figured it out, but don't want to get him into trouble with registry shit. Would suck for him, but kinda hoping he DOESN'T get out of there until we're ready to go or already moved.",1,,2024-11-30 13:57:37,t1_lzoq31d,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1h2stl4/philadelphia_temporary_housing/lzpnwkz/

lzrfxxm,comment,,I'm in New Jersey and my evaluation was free provided by the state. The evaluation here was a long test to determine if you are compulsive and repetitive. In New Jersey there's a distinction with people that are compulsive and repetitive and not. If you are compulsive and repetitive you may have to go to Avenel which is a sex offender prison and you will have to register every 3 months instead of once a year. They asked a lot of questions about a lot of things. Questions like when you go shopping do you buy the item at the first time you see it or do you go through a lot of items to choose the right item for you. This question is intended to show if you have impulses meaning do you make impulse purchases which means you're compulsive. There was also a part of the test where you are asked to flip the page over and draw a house. This question was intended to see how you follow directions a lot of people did not flip the paper over to draw the house that Drew it in the front page. I don't remember what that reasoning behind that question was. When I asked a psychologist relative of mine I believe they said it shows interfamilial relationships. We are also asked to draw a picture of ourselves I believe and not like a stick person you can Google that to find what that means and why. And there was also a short interview with a psychologist.,2,,2024-11-30 20:06:44,t3_1h23p52,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1h23p52/sex_offender_evaluation/lzrfxxm/

I feel for you. I was in a similar position, and was ultimately let go.  This was almost my *dream* job.

In my particular instance, all during the interview and initial hiring processes, I disclosed my record , especially prior to the required criminal record checks. 

Initially, I was hired as strictly a warehouse worker bee and quickly ""rose thru the ranks"" so to speak.   Fast forward a few years later, and I was in a more customer/client facing role.  Someone knew about my background and threatened the admin and also threatened to go to the local media unless steps were taken.

Here's the twist.   Because all of the original higher ups that allowed my hiring were no longer employed with the non-profit place I was employed at, I was fired BUT with some ""benefits"" due to being no fault of my own.  I was given 1 yr severance of wages, cash equivalent payout of my company paid health benefits, as well as access to a employment-finding services.     To note, I also had to sign a NDA saying I wouldn't bad mouth them after.

I suspect what occurs is that the employer really doesn’t care about the background. But then after some length of time someone googles you or finds out about your background then complain to the employer saying they feel unsafe or wtf ever. Then the employers fire you because they don’t want that risk. Not that you actually are a risk but someone could claim something and sue the employer.

If you fit the qualifications and you have the experience and you're able to perform the work that they require you to do and you have paid your debt to society there should be obligated to employ you. Companies that employee ex-felons also can get tax credits and a lot of benefits that the federal government offers in order for them to keep you employed. And I believe that they are also insured for any damages that may suffer by employing you and taking on the risk.,1,,2024-11-30 19:50:30,t1_lzlqgii,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1h1y9j0/my_job_suddenly_wants_to_have_a_chat_with_me_in/lzrcx5k/

lzk82o2,comment,,"The comparison above isn't about the living or dying thing. It's that in both cases the person is knowingly withholding information that may cause the other person to make a different decision.

First of all, telling a person about your situation before the relationship reaches a sexual level is morally the right thing to do. You admitted in your own comments that, ""It's only going to scare her off."" So, you're admitting that your actions are totally selfish, with no respect or regard for the other person. You're lying to them (knowingly withholding information that you know the other person should have is lying by omission) for your own sexual gratification. These are the types of actions and thinking distortions that many of us had when committing the crimes that got us here in the first place.

Secondly, being honest about your situation helps protect you against the possibility of false allegations. We had a post on here a year or so ago about this exact situation. The guy never told the woman that he was a sex offender and when she found out, according to him she went ballistic. She told him she was going to the police and telling them it was non-consensual. And in his post, he said that her reaction was so extreme that he thought she was going to do it. To the best of my knowledge, we never heard from him again so maybe she did.

Let me ask you a question... If a woman did react that way and went to the police, who do you think they will believe? The woman claiming the sex was non-consensual or the registered sex offender.",3,,2024-11-29 14:16:38,t1_lzhnxbh,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1h1x62d/alone_again/lzk82o2/
lzsnzpd,comment,,"Correct. It is not illegal anywhere. The government cannot ban you from accessing any portion of the Internet. The only way they're 'kind of' able to is if the application/website very specifically caters to minors, and only minors. Even then, Roblox, for example, which my son plays, and I sometimes play with him, I scraped their terms of use and they have nothing explicitly restricting us. Whereas any of the Dating sites owned by Match Group (Tinder, Match.com, Hinge, etc.) all bake that into their terms of us, despite their apps all being 18+. It's just companies being selfish and using the right to deny anyone business to carve out an entire section of the population, for fear that our inclusion would hurt their bottom line.

One thing I would suggest is find better dating apps. I use two fairly unknown dating apps Feeld and Beedee. They're a little more fringe dating apps, Feeld catering more to the polyamorous community, and BeeDee catering more to the kink communities out there. But for that very reason, all I've found is absolutely wonderful connections on both of those apps. My one serious connection on Feeld, I told her on the second meeting and she has been 1000% on board, loving me more and more, and actually wanting to protect me and ensure my safety from anyone out there who might do me harm. Even not wanting to mention anything to her family until we've built enough rapport that they have skin in the game and have to think seriously about it, without making a knee jerk decision.

I mention those two apps because I have scraped their terms of use as well (I scraped FetLife and found they aggressively target SOs that are reported in their community, so they immediately lost my business) and they do not have even a hint of targeting and removing SOs. Only the sensible verbiage stating that if anyone is found using their services to abuse/harass, that they will be dealt with accordingly.

I seriously can't promote them enough, if you're looking for a decent dating app and can work within the confines of open minded communities, because so far they seem to be equally accepting of us, that they haven't had the lawyers put verbiage in to ban us from their apps.

lzllqf2,comment,,"Believe me, I get it. 

Most, if not all of us want to be able to just move on and live a normal life again. We've done our time and completed treatment so everything should be back to normal, right? But the reality is that it's a new normal that we have to live by. And part of that means that we have to be accountable for what got us here and try to not fall back into a pattern of thoughts or actions that contributed to it. 

And part of that new normal means that we have to take precautions that others don't have to and that we never had to take before. Because we have a target on our backs. 

Unfortunately, there's a part of society that would like nothing more than to see us fail again. And if we somehow get caught up again in the judicial process, whether the actions or allegations are true or not, as someone who has already offended once, my guess is that the experience won't go very well. 

This is a great community. I don't know of another like it on the internet. We have to realize that there are people here at all different levels of the process. Some that are just starting and fearful of what's ahead. Others that have been out for decades. We can all learn from one another.

I would bring it up instead of just ignoring it and letting it eat you up. Allow him to tell you about it and the changes he has made in himself over the time since he committed the crime. Tell him how much it upsets you that he didn’t tell you in the first place and take time to yourself to figure what you want to do.

That said, I think it's best for offenders to be honest and in this case, for you to bring it up to him. One thing to consider is that you can't really get a good picture of what happened by looking at his charges. The justice system is not trying to determine truth. The vast majority of defendants are coerced into a plea by overcharging, so you end up with whatever charge that you're able to negotiate.

Talk with him, figure out his perspective on what happened, and decide how much you believe him. Then, you can decide if you feel comfortable in the relationship. One other thing to consider is that a previous sex offense is not a good predictor of future sex offenses. Recidivism is very low for sex offenses.",13,,2024-11-29 01:21:04,t3_1h1rq6s,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1h1rq6s/found_my_boyfriend_on_so_list/lzhswmg/

Meaning if what we did, are doing, or planning to do is “ok” then there’s no need to keep anything a secret. He should have told her early on. Maybe not lead with it but definitely by the third date. Also, what someone reads is never the same as hearing the in and out of someone’s story/offense. People read what they read and are mortified until the offender is able to take accountability and illustrate (not explain away) the situation at the time of the offense. Who they were. How they ended up here. Who they are now. How they have changed.

lzvbf4z,comment,,"I've been with my partner for a year this month. He told me less than a month into us being exclusive that he was a RSO. He told me that he had actually intended to wait a longer amount of time before telling me than he did (someone had texted his coworker/acquaintance harassing them about ""do you know so-and-so's a sex offender?"" and it scared him about me finding out not from him directly so he bit the bullet and had the convo with me then). The reason he said he wanted to wait longer before telling me was so I could have time to get to know the man he was today and the content of his character before the label that was thrust on him over a decade ago. I told him that I was glad he didn:t wait to tell me. Him being forthcoming helped me to feel like I could trust him. He explained that in the past, anyone he was interested in or seeing left when they found out, so I can understand his desire to go slow and be mindful of how to bring it up.

Now I will say, my bf's charge was non-violent and the victim was less than 5 years younger than him. His sentencing was very light. He was extremely remorseful and became a better person and has never had another criminal offense. Had he physically assaulted someone or had repeat offenses, my choice to stay with him may have been different. I don't know the details of the guy you are seeing's crime, so make your own judgements.

lzrh5zf,comment,,Perhaps this is the best thing that ever happened you spared him the agony and the anxiety of having to tell you. I believe you should engage him in a non-confrontational manner and inform him of the fact that you know. Ask him why he didn't tell you but I could tell you that it's a very difficult thing to tell somebody especially somebody that you care about. Or there is the possibility that he does not think that your relationship was serious enough for him to tell you. Or perhaps he was scared that he would lose you if you told you. You can only find out the reason if you speak to him.I don't think you should cut off and destroy your chance at a happy life just because of this. I understand you may feel betrayed and that you feel that you would have reacted in a positive way to the information but he doesn't know that. Perhaps you are also the best thing that has happened to him snd he was afraid to lose it. If you know him long enough to know what kind of person he is then this information should be irrelevant to you. He made a mistake 20 years ago. He's paid his debt to society and he has been treating you well. I don't think you should not have told you but perhaps there are some factors that only he knows which I believe you should find out what they are.,1,,2024-11-30 20:13:24,t3_1h1rq6s,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1h1rq6s/found_my_boyfriend_on_so_list/lzrh5zf/

lzyev3b,comment,,"lol is this a real question?  No I certainly don’t tell someone whom I hope to date or be with romantically EVERYTHING I’ve done in the last 20 years. To even categorize a sexual assault or SO crime in with EVERYTHING I’ve done in the last 20 years is on its own is ridiculous. Your statement suggests a sexual assault is no different than a trip to Europe. Both are big deals, but one is far more important to disclose.  I absolutely tell those people about my offense because of if I own up to it, and own it, no one can use it against me. If I am honest first before I’m caught or found out, I’m less likely to be viewed as though I was keeping it a secret or hiding from my reality. Show many any treatment where it says withhold until “you feel the time is right”. There is no good time. Every treatment program I’ve ever heard of or been involved in highly suggest this being disclosed before intimacy.  And being honest in the beginning is better than the “this has been amazing, but….i have to tell you something” speech. In my original response I said not on day one, but let’s be honest, why would you wait several months. Can you really just forget or think it’s not important enough to disclose. It’s only my opinion, but I can’t think of any actually GOOD reason why I wouldn’t tell someone in a several month time frame. Let’s not forget, he still had not told her at the time of the post. My wife of 10 years was clued in by me after a week. We had 2 dates. 5 phone calls, and a visit with my PO. Dated her for 5 years. Now married for 10.  Because IT IS my opinion and thought process I told her in the very beginning.  Again, this is based on my belief and how I have navigated. Keep that in mind before you try to come for me.",1,,2024-12-02 00:01:42,t1_lzyaf9t,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1h1rq6s/found_my_boyfriend_on_so_list/lzyev3b/
lzl7grd,comment,,"Thin line between when it’s appropriate and when it’s convenient.  I’d venture to guess that any treatment facilitator and/or PO would say any potential relationship and partner should be told up front. Holding it is a form of grooming. But you’re correct we don’t know all the details. In Wisconsin before you could even date someone they had to meet your PO. Every state is different. You could also argue that the boyfriend could sense the response he may have gotten and that’s why he chose to not disclose. One thing is for certain, if he “didn’t think this was serious” he should go back to treatment. What if she has children? What if she’s bringing him around children. What if she is unknowingly putting him at risk because she doesn’t know what his triggers are?",3,,2024-11-29 17:48:56,t1_lzl66z6,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1h1rq6s/found_my_boyfriend_on_so_list/lzl7grd/

Non consensual sex is any sex act with a minor since they can't consent.  20 years ago that could mean a 5 year age difference. Any reoffense? Your exact over-reaction without enough factual information is why RSOs don't trust anyone to tell and what can often contribute to the very low recidivism rate, oftentimes from depression and relapse.

lzjcuu8,comment,,"CA tiers aren't based on risk unless you're a high-risk offender (static 99 score of 6 or higher) where a normal tier 1 or 2 offense is elevated to tier 3, but those individuals can still petition for removal after 20 years as stated in PC 290.5. So, you should be able to petition in 1.5-2 years if you're being elevated to tier 3 based on high risk regardless of a new evaluation.

Otherwise, very, very few challenges to tier assignments that are clearly defined by law have been successful even when the law is clearly ""poorly worded"" such as requiring lifetime registration for nonviolent noncontact offenses (like CP, or ""sting offenses like 288.2, 288.3 or 288.4) or placing people at higher tiers when far more extreme offenses are lower tiers (like 288c1 being tier 3 for a 14/15 year old victim and 288a being tier 2 for an under year old victim). The law isn't perfect, and it's why the changes are going to happen.

lzl5enf,comment,,"...most offenses are in the ""lower than 288,"" including ones involving minors. 

I respect your privacy, but also stand by my previous statements related to what you have shared: the lack of direct correlation between risk and tier, and many failed previous attempts to reclassify offenses expressly stated in the statue. The latter is largely because we do not have an equal protection claim since the overturning of Hofsheier case, so making claims about being equally situated as others isn't a valid one. 

So ultimately, I'm genuinely confused at what you're trying to do based on what you've said and what the law and case law states. 

I wish you luck, but also have to state, please make sure you are working with a repected attorney and not filing frivolous lawsuits that will only create bad case law, making things worse for everyone.

Currently a 288c1 is tier 3 even if it is misdeameanor. It is proposed to be changed, but there is not movement by the legislature on that yet. It's a convo I won't post here, but some speed bumps have been presented recently. 

Now, an attempted as defined under penal code 664 could reduce a tier assignment under the new DOJ directive, but I don't think it would for a 664/288c1 (attempted 288c), but I don't know for sure because of how 288c is currently treated regardless of felony or misdeameanor. That would be a very unique and probably rare situation. It would be something you'd have to talk to Janice Bellucci about and it may take litigation over. 

But, being an out of state conviction, it makes it even harder and will need to be talked about with Janice. The a DOJ won't look at and try to classify the offense until you move here, if you aren't already in CA.

We've spoken to Janice via text and she advised us to contact an attorney in CA for advice so we contacted a Public Defender. The PD is more than willing to help with petition for removal IF he is considered Tier 1 or Tier 2.  We don't want to move and then we jumped from the proverbial frying pan into the fire and he is automatically put in the public site (he is not as of now) 
If he is classified a Tier 3, then there is no incentive to move to CA. It would be Life there or Life here. We are hoping Doe vs Mayes in the Ninth Circuit rules in our favor of keeping Level One risk off the public website... then we would  stay put.

Also, since he's not on disciplinary segregation, but rather on administrative segregation, he should be afforded better access and privileges, but BOP staff are lazy and don't want to track the difference.

lzb44s0,comment,,"Sounds like you've been working on this for a while already, and your PD sounds like he might be decent.  BUT, if you have some $$ you can always shop around.  I went through 4-5 free phone consults with lawyers wanting to charge $200-300/hour before I found one that would do it for a flat fee.  They only wanted \~7k, and let me do monthly payments of 500 or so.   And then they wound up waiving the last 1k.  At the very least you might be able to get some free advice on whether refusing the plea deal is a good idea.  

As for the rest, the beginning of the process is definitely the worst part.  I was raided when I was \~25, took about 3 years from raid to going to prison.  5 years for receipt of CP.  When I got out I was \~35.  It was definitely weird working the same jobs as 18-20yos.  Chipotle, hosting/bussing at restaurants, but it was $$ and let me live on my own so I was happy.

I'm someone that's easily happy though.  Give me some stuff to watch on tv, videogames to play, meat to eat, and coke to drink and I'm good.  I was never really big on dating, more...random hookups lol, and I've been able to do that fine too!

I see plenty of posts here about people finding new loves after prison though.  Most people say to be up front right away but...well, I'd give it some time, even if just a few weeks lol.  I've been out of prison since late 2017 and haven't told a single person about my charges.  Only my managers at chipotle knew I just got out of prison, and that's because I told them (though I lied about WHY I went to prison).  I thought it would help explain my gap in work history, plus I was in a halfway house and they needed to sign stuff anyway.  So I thought it'd be simpler to tell them PART of the truth, and it got me the job!

I've told a few family members the truth (they also thought i went to prison for copyright infringement) and they had no issues with it either.  That can obviously be very hit or miss.  I've had family cut me off as well, cousins and an aunt who I'd known my whole life and haven't spoken to me since I told them \~14 years ago.  Though they DID all write letters to the judge on my behalf.  Some stopped talking to me and then reached out again later after prison.  One of my cousins even wanted me to come over and meet her family (I had never met 2 of her kids) when I was in town.  But I was only in town overnight to go to a funeral so I wasn't really feeling up to a big reunion.

I'd say it's worth it though, if by IT you mean uh...life.  There are people that have a very difficult time, but it's much much rarer.  I think most of us SOs are just chugging along, finding happiness wherever we can.  I've been pretty lucky I feel.  You have your mom at least (anyone else?) and that's a huge help.  If everything in my life fell apart and I had no $$ no prospects and nothing else, I could always go live w/ her (she'd have to move though, but she would).

Have you looked at food service?  Doesn't have to be fast food.  Here in Vegas anyway I don't think any of the food service stuff really does background checks.  Maybe if you work FOR a casino.  But I've gotten jobs at a few restaurants, some in a casino but not owned by it, with no problem.

It's not glamorous, but it can be good $$.  Minimum wage here is 11.25 rn, and the last place I was at paid dishwashers 16-17, plus a free meal each shift, which was maybe \~$18 worth depending on what you got.  I was bussing which was min + tips, but worked out to 20-30/hour for the most part, depending on when I worked.  Hell, they had a position where someone just came in and rolled silverware for 7-8 hours lol, and they made $13-14!  It was super easy but everyone they hired kept getting fired.  They kept hiring young girls that would get bored and wander off to be on their phone.  We were constantly low on silverware (rolling it into napkins) so they'd get whoever they could spare go back and do it.  I thought it was stupid easy so volunteered a lot.  They didn't mind if I had my phone propped up and watched stuff, as long as I was DOING the job.

And it's fairly easy to move around/up in a restaurant.  I've seen people start as host and then move to server within a few weeks.",4,,2024-11-27 21:33:57,t3_1h11nsb,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1h11nsb/my_story_so_far_adivce/lzb44s0/

Life might be harder than you anticipated, but don’t give up because of that. I have heard that having pending criminal cases do show up on background checks so that could be why you’re having an issue with finding a job right now - the unknown for employers of what is to come makes you look a little less reliable, I would assume. Once you have your trial and finish whatever your sentence may be, there might be a little more ease with finding something (fingers crossed). 

Lean on your loved ones and enjoy life right now. You don’t have much control over what’s going to happen, but you can make the most of each day and take it one day at a time. This is the hardest part of it all. The unknown. We lived in the unknown for 2 1/2 years before he was taken in at change of plea - my worst fear was him going to jail and it became a reality (I knew it was bound to happen but still the unknown).

As for work apply to cell tower companies. To be 100% honest, if you don’t have a felony, drug problem, or a woman/custody problems, you won’t fit in.   The cell tower industry is nothing but degenerates but that’s my kinda people.. we all tolerate our coworkers and boss, talk mad shit to and about each other, but at the end of the day their life is in my hands and mine is in there’s so you kind of form a brotherly bond and when my coworkers found out about my whole case, one of them goes “I don’t give a fuck what kind of porn you watch at home, as long as we get our shit done for the day and I get to go home”

It’s one of those industries fueled on self hatred, cocaine, and nicotine… just don’t do the powder or your paychecks will disappear just as fast and the blow

I hope there's a resolution for you let your public defender do the work and see what he comes up with for this private group sting. Regarding jobs a lot of jobs do background checks for three or five years. I have had jobs that did background checks and hired me anyway my offense was over 12 years ago. But there are jobs out there that don't even do background checks. I spent over $300,000 on my defense with some of the best attorneys in the state of New Jersey and didn't get shit from them.

The treatment provider I was seeing pretrial told me that I should be saving as much as possible, since I'd definitely need it later on. He was certainly right about that.

lz5mk2r,comment,,"Just a suggestion - If he hasn't done so already, make sure he talks with his lawyer and gives the lawyer the OK to talk with you.  (not everyone does or wants this) Once that's done, talk to the lawyer.  Explain that you absolutely want him to have contact with his child.  Tell the lawyer you want to speak with the judge during sentencing.  

You have an opportunity to send a letter of support to the judge, as both his wife and the mother of his child.  Do it.  Tell the judge what he's really like, the man you know.  And stress the bond they share, and that your child needs him as much as he needs her.  When it comes time for sentencing, your husband will be allowed to say something to the judge, if he wishes.  He should.  And he should take responsibility for his actions.  You should also get a chance to speak, because your daughter is involved. Again, tell the judge about the man you know, and that they should have contact.

Now, assuming his counseling/treatment is going well, and the prosecutor is agreeable, he should not end up losing contact, and may still be able to live with you.  This is entirely up to the judge - so don't do anything to tick him or her off.

Good luck!",6,,2024-11-26 23:13:26,t3_1h0o7yp,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1h0o7yp/just_need_someone_to_talk_to/lz5mk2r/

lz66gwp,comment,,"Oh my goodness, I am going through the SAME thing right now. My husband was charged with CP and voyeurism. He was offered a plea of 26 months. He is the main breadwinner and his kids LOVE him. They are also shattered that they can't see him (no-contact order) and are spiraling into depression. (10, 15 and 18). He is also a good man and finally doing a bunch of therapy to try and get his sentencing reduced and to get BETTER. He never wanted to be this person but stupid addiction is hard to break on your own.  In your situation I do think he will be able to see your daughter again. If you have a no-contact order, you can ask the judge to remove it. From my research, they will eventually remove it if your husband shows he is putting in the work.

lz6dede,comment,,"I understand more than you know. My husband of 6 years at the time of his offense, we have 3 daughters who were 6,5,5. When he was taken into custody they put a ban on him from seeing or living with our children, for 14 months he did not get to speak, see or live with us. It wasn’t until a plea deal was offered and accepted was he able to see them but only supervised by a company that does supervised visits. It was $150 a visit for 1 hour a week. We did this for the next 4 months, until it was time for sentencing. He received 15 years all suspended and the registry. During his sentencing they added a clause that he can not be alone with his children without the approved chaperone was around. I was that chaperone. I know what he did was wrong but I also know so past trauma helped make those choices. I told myself that if we chose to be involved in the girls lives, and he put 100% effort into bettering himself and learning why the offense happened then I would be willing to try and make it work. We have now been married coming up on 16 years, the marriage is the easy part. The rules from probation, the registry, the schools (most SOs with children can go to a school with written prior notice from the superintendent and a chaperone into the event for the child or school meetings and a chaperone out of the school), how no one else under the age of 18 can be in our house. Please think about the life that you will be giving your daughter by staying. Will she be able to have a normal childhood? Will she be deprived of all the things you hope for her? Will the financial burden of dad affect her life? Being with an SO is financially draining especially in the beginning. Group therapy is expensive for them and my husband had a mandatory 2 years of it, the probation fees monthly, the lack of employment because it’s harder than hell for SOs to get a job. Also just because you don’t stay doesn’t mean he can’t be part of her life.",5,,2024-11-27 01:59:32,t3_1h0o7yp,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1h0o7yp/just_need_someone_to_talk_to/lz6dede/

I thank God for my wife and children.  I plead to possession about 10 years ago and served 23 months in state prison.  A lot will depend upon the State where you live, but with a CP conviction (not molestation) and your daughter is his biological child, I'd be pretty confident that you all will be together again.  When I would go to visitation, you would be surprised at the number of children there, seeing their daddy.  I think you did the right thing to post here. Many states and areas have advocacy organizations for RSOs as well as spouses/family members.  If your husband is anything like me, he is probably heart broken to be putting you through this pain. The worst part - worse than prison and I'll say even the registry - is the pain and confusion our family members are caused.  Courage to you.  I've found this to be a safe space.

I’m concerned that your attorney isn’t familiar with this. Hiring an attorney with CP cases experience is a must. I’d look at switching post trial or at some point.

lz5knmi,comment,,"Not sure where you are in NY, but I guess it all comes down to his conditions from the Judge AND conditions set forth by his treatment provider. In my treatment program, we are required to do safety plans. Most conditions are commiserate with the crime committed. For instance, computer crimes get internet restrictions/monitoring and hands on crimes don't, but might receive more limitations on being around minors. My friend/group member is 30. He had a kid at 18. Committed the crimes of Oral Copulation of his minor cousin at the age of 18. He is still allowed unrestricted access to his biological kid. Treatment may want to do certain tests to confirm his reason for watching CP doesn't stem from the want to be physical with a minor. You will most likely have to go through a chaperone program which didn't take long for my mother, (one night of zoom and an in-person meeting with my PO, me, and my therapist). It varies by treatment provider though. I would stress to his lawyer his want to be around his biological kid. Make sure he/she mentions that it will only help his rehabilitation and that he is willing and ready to take any pre reqs to make that happen. For reference, In NYC, you wouldn't be allowed initial access to your kid if the crime involved your kid. Restrictions = commiserate with the crime. Feel free to pm if you prefer.

This was an abusive, controling, unhealthy relationship without him being involved in violating others. Until he gets charged and it fully ruins his and potentially your life completely he won't seek real help. He has a serious problem and has to see that himself and want to get better. The no remorse crap doesn't work. It only shows that right now he can not be trusted with anything or anyone. 

I'm all about forgiving. I'm in favor of couples trying everything to stay together and standing by those you love no matter what, but he's not to even a safe place yet in his mind.

lz2w4tv,comment,,"Oddly enough, I’ve been lurking here for the same reason and have not come across anyone with a similar story. However, we have children that were in the videos so there is zero chance of reconciliation and I hope he rots in prison and then rots in hell. I just came to say I understand. I feel so paranoid all of the time. Even after the sweep I have pulled up all of the vents, I’ve taken down ceiling vents, looked behind and in the same toilets multiple times, taken apart light fixtures ect.. It truly is such an earth shattering experience. I’m considering selling the home and moving somewhere else because I don’t think I’ll ever feel safe here with my kids, but honestly when something like this happens you realize anyone is capable of anything and that’s a terrifying feeling so I don’t know if I would feel anymore at peace in a different house. It’s wildly difficult to not only lose your person, but to find out your person is quite literally a stranger to you. I have absolutely no idea who I was married to, shared a life with, and had children with. Not many people can relate to that. 

I will say I’ve been dealing with this for a few months. First it started out as finding very sexually suggestive things about children on his phone. I absolutely lost it and turned him in and kicked him out because I honestly thought it was illegal. He adamantly denied actually having anything illegal even when he knew the cops were investigating. Then he was charged for having A LOT of illegal content. I looked him in the eye and asked if our kids were victims when we were in court while I was asking for a no contact order for the kids before he was formally charged. He adamantly denied they were victims. He emailed me a few weeks later to apologize and I asked again if the kids were victims and he adamantly denied they were again. A couple weeks ago I was cleaning out his truck to sell it and I found the box to a hidden camera. I turned it over to the police who had come into possession of a second phone a coworker of his found and turned in just days prior. A couple days after turning over the new evidence they were able to crack his phone and found that my children were in fact victims.

I tell you all of this to say, it is significantly worse than he is letting on right now. Prepare for that. I scheduled me and the kids for therapy yesterday because I’m hanging on by one single thread right now. I know I need to get better so I can support my kids properly through this once they are made aware of the situation. Get into therapy, cut ties with him, and run for your life. There is better out there and you deserve better. You will never understand why he did what he did. I’ve looked high and low for any kind of answers and there just isn’t any or at least any that make me feel better. Accept that, heal yourself, and move on. My husband also tried to jump right into therapy and claim it was a porn addiction. In my opinion, there is no excuse or rationalization good enough to make it acceptable to offend against your own family and I am so thankful I cut ties immediately and didn’t allow him around the kids from day one. His “addiction” didn’t cause him to steal some money from me, it caused him to sexually abuse me and my children. There isn’t any coming back from that. He will never see the children again as long as I live.

I am also an empathetic person and up until I found out my children were victims I tried to rationalize why he did what he did and search for answers even though we were no contact. I’m still searching for how someone could hurt their own family which is why I’m starting therapy. I know I’m searching for an answer that doesn’t exist and never will. The closest I have come is that he is evil, but that isn’t even good enough. I realize I need to work on myself to get peace. I will not find peace within this situation or within him. 

Finally, I just want to say you’re a badass. Stay strong and don’t use unhealthy coping mechanisms to deal with this. YOU deserve more than that. You deserve to heal properly. I whole heartedly believe we (my kids, me, you, your friends, every victim effected by this shit) has the capacity to come out of this stronger and better in the end if we are willing to allow ourselves to heal. I’d also encourage you to reach out to your close family and friends and have an open conversation. I know I have a lot of guilt and shame for allowing this man into my life and to father children and I was so terrified everyone would judge me and hate me. When I reached out there was an outpouring of love and support. These are his sins to carry, not yours. ",7,,2024-11-26 14:39:30,t3_1h04lts,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1h04lts/recently_found_out_husband_had_multiple_hidden/lz2w4tv/

The escalation came toward the end of the pandemic.  He was, however, very remorseful about what he did and very open in talking about it.  He accepted full responsibility.

I’m so sorry you’re going through this. I know it feels unbelievable and your world has just been turned upside down. We have three children and have been together for 17 years, married for 15. My husband changed the last few years, four years actually. It is an extremely difficult Thing, even though he wasn’t charged with anything, and I was the one that discovered all of it. I definitely believe it is an addiction, but it is one that I do not understand. Every day feels hard, I was very blindsided because we had no other problems. We were known as a power couple and I was very open with him sexually. He had multiple chances to tell me, and he never did. For the past almost 8 months. I have been asking myself why he didn’t trust me enough to tell me that he was struggling with this, and I literally just realized yesterday that it wasn’t that I didn’t make him feel comfortable enough to tell me, His trust issues are about him, not me.

I ended up just closing to a few friends, and even told some of his family. I felt like they would help us both and make sure that he is on the straight and narrow path. There’s no going back.

I don’t think I can really trust him ever again. Especially given the fact that he did and continued to gaslight me saying that I was the sole reason for him having cameras. He told his family that I was an addict and alcoholic and spun this story to throw me under the bus at every turn. He even admitted to me, had it not gotten legal he would have continued with this narrative- ‘I am the one w the problem and he is the concerned husband that took things too far.’ I’ve sacrificed so much for this man and to be with him. Only to be lied to continuously and manipulated and made to believe im the problem. Then to find out he allegedly had a porn addiction and masturbates several times a day in addition to the cameras that were all over our home… I don’t think I can stay with someone who has lied for so many years with such ease. I do feel sympathy for him… and I never wanted him to get in trouble or suffer by any means.

There was also a video of him adjusting the camera with him in full shot shot testing it out as it fed to his iPhone.

lz5oswt,comment,,"Is this federal or state?  I don't have experience with state, so feel free to ignore.  Assuming it's fed, visit that prison's website.  There will be a section for visitors.  You'll see rules, a lengthy rule list.  It includes what you're able to wear (or specifically, NOT wear) and bring with you.  Among those rules would be something like, you can bring a bag, but only if it's clear plastic.  You can bring X amount of change, to be used in the vending machines.  Photos are allowed, but he has to buy photo tickets in advance, you can't pay for them during your visit.  Once you're seated, that's it.  You can get up to go to the bathroom or vending machine, or to have your picture taken, but no walking around.  And your husband will not be able to leave his seat unless the cops call for a bathroom break (visitors can go at any time, prisoners only when the cops call it out, about every half hour or so).

You'll be able to give him a hug/brief kiss at the beginning of the visit and the end - that's it. You'll be sitting across from him, not next to him, with several feet between your chairs.  

There is an area set aside for kids, if they want to watch DVDs or play with toys/games, every visitation room has one.

Under no circumstances wear an under-wire bra.  It may or may not say this on the rules list, but they won't let you in if you're wearing one.

Everyone in the party will go through security.  Generally, this will involve going through an X-Ray machine and a pat-down.  They're looking for folks bringing stuff into the prison that they shouldn't be.  You're not trying that, so you will be fine.

lz4806k,comment,,"Just a quick run down of my personal experience. I committed my crime in my youth, I was 13 at the time. My blood sister is one of my victims. Hands on crime. 

I went away to inpatient treatment, then foster care. I couldn’t come home because of my sister. I felt discarded, less than. 

I essentially followed the same path. I was in and out of lockup from 1995 until 2014. Registry violations, breaking and entering, and check fraud. 

Today I sit with 7 adult felonies, over a decade of incarceration, and another 12 years of supervision. 

I didn’t get it until my mid 30s. Time and again, I had family to fall back on, give me a place to stay to “get on my feet”. I took it all for granted, and was bitter for years.

The last time, I went the half way house route, I had burned all my bridges by then. I had a short 15 months parole that I walked down. Completed parole, and my then 11 years old daughter moved in. 

Mom is obviously pretty crappy if I’m the best option at that point, but that’s a whole different can of worms. 

I was 36 and starting over from scratch. I had rebuilt relationships with my family, my sister. Doing it on my own felt good, it was empowering. 

Today, my daughter is an adult. I have a good job, and position within the company. I do stand up comedy based on my life’s experience. I feel good most days. 

Cut him off. Make him go it alone. He will be better for it. Tough love seems to be the route needed to push him forward. Age and education are the two biggest contributors to recidivism.

I took it heart and it’s what fueled my decision making to not go back.

The other thing was dealing with my childhood trauma. It’s why I was caught up in the legal system. In no way am I implying that you caused this or that he may have any issues. But for me, dealing with what I had kept buried, helped me understand my behavior and fill the hole so I didn’t any more.

My only thought for help is if there is an addiction; and he is ready, help there.

Unfortunately, he is back on the inside.

I can only offer what the others have to offer and a little bit further. Some places are likely to civilly commit a person on the registry due to diagnosed mental health issues that shows lack of impulse control among other things. He does not want to go in there.

lyznxwj,comment,,"With a conviction that old, the only thing that should be showing on a private background check in CA is your registration status, so even if you were eligable a Certificate of Rehabilitation wouldn't help you. Only convictions within 7 years show, but the registration status shows, so that's your hurdle.

However, despite the conversation above, you may actually be eligible for a COR because the penal code designations have drastically changed from when you were convicted to now. It's complicated and since your sentence for your offense isnt listed, you could be eligible for a COR

In short, A 288a then is different than a 288(a) now. The only way to find out if you are possibly eligible is to see what your offense is designated as now. Megans Law website doesn't necessarily show this change either. Some old 288a's are equal to PC 287 or others now and are eligible for COR. It depends on the nature of the conduct and its not appropriate to openly discuss on reddit. The laws changed in 2017.

What will help you is termination of your registration status, which you are likely a tier 2 and will be eligible to do when you reach 20 years post release. This will greatly enhance your abilities, so what i can suggest is to find out your tier by going to your registration office and getting either your tier designation letter or form 8050 (proof of current registration). These will show you your tier. If your tier 1 then apply now for termination of registration, if tier 2, when you hit 20 years after you were last released from physical custody, apply for termination of registration. 

You can contact Janice Bellucci with ACSOL or Chance Oberstein as attorneys who are experts in this area, and they can give you an exact answer about eligibility for COR and ending registration",5,,2024-11-25 23:42:20,t3_1gzvmka,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gzvmka/california_sex_offender_cant_get_a_job_fails/lyznxwj/

HR is going to be your biggest hurdle. 

Things you will need to consider is how the background checks and laws apply in your state, this is very important. There are things you can do to improve your chances of passing a background check if you're creative and don't mind venturing into gray areas.

In tech, your past work history and skill level can get you past a failed background check. 

What I wouldn't do, if you don't have a good current work history that's current or still close , don't apply at places you really want to right now, wait to get good history.

Your best chance to get into tech is going to be through Vendors, especially of the Indian variety. Some examples would be WIPRO, TCS, Accenture, etc. In my experience, these places will simply not care, or even tell the client you passed a background check even if you didn't. They pay close to the market from what I hear.

Portugal and Germany are both places you can work remotely and will not do a background check at all for the most part.

Freelance is another option, not one I ever liked, I hate chasing for payments. 

In my personal experience, and might only be applicable to me, so not suggesting this is the best route for you, but I never had a good outcome giving up information that wasn't asked and just keeping quiet. So much so it would be almost impossible for someone to convince me it's the better option.

All I can say, the penance will be going through multiple rounds of interviews potentially to get denied from the background check, but that's a disability you will have to live with forever unfortunately, where most people will have only the interview rounds to be rejected, you will always have one more reason to get rejected even with a good round of interviews.

Do the interviews, roll the dice, hope for the best, and don't stop trying. It has always worked for me, and I am in a very very good place in life now, I could even say I might not have been as successful as I am now if not for my past",4,,2024-11-26 15:14:41,t1_lyzj7hx,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gzvmka/california_sex_offender_cant_get_a_job_fails/lz32cbt/

HR employees cannot discuss or disclose the details of your personal information. Meaning at most they can only say to anyone that you failed the background check. It would be illegal to use that information in any way but for assessing you for that particular position.

In tech, your first interview is most likely going to be from a Senior developer or project lead, I think it would be crazy to tell them anything personal at all. They have zero obligation to do what they want with that info. 

I see no benefit whatsoever telling the person that is doing your interview anything other than what is asked and relevant. If you feel compelled to be upfront about your personal information, reach out to HR, not the interviewer.

As a moderator I can: 

1. Ban him 
2. Keep removing almost everything he comments
3. Let people believe it (which would mean the OP wouldn’t go apply for something he may very well qualify for) 

As a user, I am fed up with his crap, and I’m allowed to be. 

I realize that you enjoy telling me how I should treat people and don’t like the fact that I am typically very blunt. That’s fine. You don’t have to read what I say. 

If I subtracted maybe 5 other users, I have spent more time helping people in this group than probably every user in it combined. Hours and hours and hours and hours of my life spent learning and helping. I don’t have to. This doesn’t affect me at all. 

I’ve found jobs for dozens of people, housing, therapists, attorneys, helped them get money on their books, avoid being arrested for violations, explained laws, written letters for people to send their representatives, helped people deal with things they couldn’t because they didn’t have time before they were incarcerated… you name it, I’ve helped. 

I work my ass off here. I don’t have to. This shit doesn’t affect me. 

So, yeah, I’m a moderator, but I’m also a human being who has limits as to how much bullshit I’m willing to take from people. Should I have responded the way I did? Probably not. But I’m still human and he’s absolutely reached my limits. 

I can’t block him because I’m a moderator. 
And, because I feel like it’s unfair to ban people just because I don’t like them, even if they’re shitty to me, I don’t. I could. But I don’t. 

So, no, I won’t apologize when my statement was correct to begin with and I’m fed up with this guy starting shit with me. I realize you can’t see it, but he’s done this for at least a couple of weeks and then he deletes it every time when he’s called out by someone else and I’m over it. You’re seeing the result of that. 

I’m more than happy to leave if you guys want me to. I don’t hate myself enough to keep putting up with being treated like absolute shit for trying to help people.

Apparently the prison he is at they’re supposed to all have their own tablets but they’re actually just sharing 5 at the moment so it’s not easy for him to call all the time. There’s also been some miscommunication in understanding his time on his account for calling and he doesn’t think he has minutes even though he does. So we have to hope he calls back instead of waiting to get another free call so we can explain it. 

We wrote letters last night explaining it all so hopefully that will allow easier communication if he doesn’t call. He’s about 1 & 1/2 from us so we’re trying to arrange visiting him as well but there still seems to be some strict rules around that from Covid so it’s kind of disappointing that we all won’t be able to see him/it sounds like it will be in a booth instead of a room.

What happens in prison follows you. If you go into any kind of protective custody, it will follow you and cause problems. Inmates will find out from prison staff. Inmates work the prisons, including classification clerks. If you catch out of one prison, people will wonder why you arrived at the new one. 

You can't hide your charge. Takes 2 min to get on the phone and have someone look you up.

If you just be polite/respectful (up to the other guy what respect means though lol) you won't run into anything serious.  I'd  seen maybe 5-6 SOs get jumped in the middle of the night, but it wasn't that bad.  Basically whoever was pissed got (paid maybe?) a few young, stupid people to jump you after lights out.  But it was mostly 1-2 sec of hitting and they ran like hell when you got up.  Mostly just stuff like a bloody nose/split lip kind of stuff, maybe a bruise.

But the thing is, every one of those incidents could've been prevented.  Most through apologizing+some restitution, but there was always several hours of warning.  You didn't just get jumped out of nowhere, you were told ""Hey, you better get off the yard by tonight"" and you could go to any guard and say you weren't safe on the yard and they'd take you into special housing.  That's also where they take you for disciplinary stuff.  Can be by yourself or a roommate depending on why you're there.  But if you're not safe, they keep you there til you can be transferred off.

The people that got jumped just thought ""They can't tell me what to do!"" and were sent to special housing unit (SHU) and transferred out ANYway, so they were pretty stupid.

We had a string of locker break-ins one year, but maybe....7-8x?  Nothing huge.  After the second we all just started taking precautions and not leaving anything that good in our lockers.

I'd recommend telling your lawyer/judge/whoever that you want to go to a yard with SOMP (sex offender anagement...program?.  There are only \~5 of those so not sure if any are super near CA, but the vast majority of inmates at those yards will be SOs, and I bet they are way less political than others.

lyy1d3c,comment,,"They don’t monitor your Internet. 

This is very much up to the PO, so no two situations will be exactly the same, but either he will be allowed computer access with monitoring or not be allowed access at all. 

If he is allowed access he will be required to use a monitoring software. The software ONLY monitors the computer or device itself, it isn’t monitoring the whole house activity. 

Make sure your devices are passworded. I would suggest putting your computer, tablets, and gaming consoles in a room you can lock. Don’t keep them in main areas. The PO isn’t going to search your things that are in your space but they can and will search any common areas. For some PO’s, pass-wording is enough, for others it isn’t. They don’t want them having access at all. 

Restrictions get lighter and easier as time passes and the PO gets to know you both as long as those interactions are positive. They tend to appreciate you taking preemptive steps and asking questions. 

I suggest sending whatever questions you have in beginning written form. I’ve never met one who didn’t prefer that because questions aren’t always easily answered.  Georgia has a lot of nuances that are based on a variety of things and they usually have to pull up the persons file to be able to answer those questions so it’s a lot more complicated than just a “yes” or “no” sometimes. 

You can use whatever you want on your own computer that your father doesn’t have access to, but they can’t see your Internet activity without getting a warrant unless something is flagged by the feds for being illegal. 

Also, I use biometric locks for my office and (adult) kids room. Easier than fumbling with keys and they’re private spaces that they are not allowed to search and that my guy can’t access. They open instantly with a thumbprint, and I don’t have to worry about him getting in trouble for off limits items being in them.",1,,2024-11-25 18:32:43,t3_1gzk519,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gzk519/help_with_knowing_internet_restrictions_of/lyy1d3c/

lyvlraf,comment,,"That does seem like a whole lot of suck.  What state are you in?

Here in NV/vegas the POs for the most part let computer crime people have a smartphone just fine.  We also don't have to pay for any monitoring.  I have NCPTC on my iphone and computer.  My PO said I couldn't have any other devices though, well no more phones/computers anyway.  My videogame systems are fine.  I have 1 or 2 polygraphs a year so it's not like I can sneak internet on any other devices.

Do you have polygraphs too?  I'd ask your therapist if that PO is strict with other SOs or if it's just you.  If you're doing well in therapy maybe  they can talk to the PO about what it would take to prove you're responsible or whatever.

That reminds me of when my mom would punish me when I was growing up.  She'd take away videogames or tv or whatever until I could prove that I'm responsible or something.  But it was so vague there was really no way for me to make headway.  I could only move BACKWARDS.  Anything else I did wrong was ""Well that's no way to get your videogames back, it's going to be a while longer now!""

Also have you talked with a lawyer?  Seems strange that the judge has the say on banning you from internet usage.  Check your paperwork, because basically all of my restrictions (did 5 years for receipt of CP in a federal low) gave my PO a lot of wiggle room.  There was a lot of ""as determined by the PO.""  But if yours is specifically your judge, then that should mean that a lawyer can argue it.

They really have to give you a more concrete path to get it back.  They can't deny it for vague reasons.  Recently, a few SOs here have gone to a judge to request to end their supervision early, and they were denied.  But because they were denied for actual reasons (albeit stupid ones), their lawyers then had something they could work against.",2,,2024-11-25 08:21:17,t3_1gzahk2,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gzahk2/commentsideassuggestions/lyvlraf/

If you rent it, they can add it and the owner wouldn’t be able to renew your lease.",3,,2024-11-25 04:21:55,t3_1gz4zfj,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gz4zfj/question_for_the_lawyers_in_the_sub_about_hoas/lyuvl3u/
lyz54ma,comment,,"Hey so I'm not a lawyer but I've got some experience with this.

To my knowledge HOAs, landlords, and apartment complexes can deny a rental app for being an RSO.

But nobody can stop you from buying property (unless maybe there's restrictions on where you can live in your state like can't live 500ft from park etc). So the HOA must allow you to buy property in their community as long as you qualify for it.

My wife and I bought a house earlier this year and have an hoa. There was not even a background check necessary for the purchase, only the regular financial stuff. I'm registered at our new address in compliance with registration laws and I've never heard anything from our HOA. Local pd has even come by and verified our current address as a random check and still never had any trouble with the HOA.

EDIT: It seems that some HOAs have laws that do forbid RSOs in their community but it's rare. If the bylaw exists already you're out of luck but it seems to be something that is no longer allowed to be added in new HOAs so if the law doesn't already exist (the case for the vast majority of HOAs) then you're fine.",2,,2024-11-25 21:57:07,t3_1gz4zfj,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gz4zfj/question_for_the_lawyers_in_the_sub_about_hoas/lyz54ma/

I really wouldn’t move to TN though. Look through the registry, see how they label people, look how often you have to register, look at the map that shows all of the exclusion zones. Many cities have put in “parks” that consist of a picnic table or a bench on a corner just to prohibit people from working or living near there. 

If there’s a park or pool in the neighborhood it’s also off limits. Everything is off limits. 

I volunteer in reentry and about 15 of us sat down last month trying to determine where RSO’s could even get jobs at now. We used to have at least 5-10 large employers in each city and another 20 or so smaller employers who would hire. 

And, many still would, but the cities or counties have put in parks, daycares, athletic fields, etc… so they no longer can. There are now at least two of the 4 biggest cities who have virtually no jobs and exceptionally little housing available. We can’t find a single major employer who is still in an area they can work in. Fast food is it, and most of those are still within 1000ft of something.",2,,2024-11-25 18:40:31,t1_lyw8ib6,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gz4zfj/question_for_the_lawyers_in_the_sub_about_hoas/lyy2v8l/

If the crime was committed on or after July 1, 2008, the following provision applies:

(b) On and after July 1, 2008, no individual shall reside within 1,000 feet of any child care facility, church, school, or area where minors congregate if the commission of the act for which such individual is required to register occurred on or after July 1, 2008. Such distance shall be determined by measuring from the outer boundary of the property on which the individual resides to the outer boundary of the property of the child care facility, church, school, or area where minors congregate at their closest points.

For acts committed between July 1, 2006 and June 30, 2008, the following provision applies:

(b) Any individual who committed an act between July 1, 2006, and June 30, 2008, for which such individual is required to register shall not reside within 1,000 feet of any child care facility, church, school, or area where minors congregate. Such distance shall be determined by measuring from the outer boundary of the property on which the individual resides to the outer boundary of the property of the child care facility, church, school, or area where minors congregate at their closest points.

For acts committed between June 4, 2003 and June 30, 2006, the following provision applies:

(b) Any individual who committed an act between June 4, 2003, and June 30, 2006, for which such individual is required to register shall not reside within 1,000 feet of any child care facility, school, or area where minors congregate. Such distance shall be determined by measuring from the outer boundary of the property on which the individual resides to the outer boundary of the property of the child care facility, school, or area where minors congregate at their closest points.

Persons convicted for offenses that occurred prior to June 4, 2003 are not subject to any residency restrictions (outside of any special conditions of a probated sentence). Further, there are ways to be “grandfathered” in to a residence if the home or property was owned prior to the relevant date. The procedure for doing so is described in O.C.G.A. 42-1-15, 16 and 17.",1,,2024-11-25 22:09:22,t1_lyz4zmw,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gz4zfj/question_for_the_lawyers_in_the_sub_about_hoas/lyz7go3/

20 years ago I had a situation arise where I actually did follow through with my registration requirements and the city clerk in charge of everything didn't file my paperwork correctly. This lead to an arrest warrant being issued for me and my picture placed in the local newspaper for failure to register. When the State police showed up at my home in force, I was lucky enough to have copies of all the paperwork that proved I had done everything I was required to do.

The fact is we are working with limited information from OP but I still stand by my point of not answering any questions.

EDIT: Also even if you are on probation when interacting with LEO you will always have your 5th amendment right against self incrimination. Let them ask their questions. If answering those questions will lead to you being arrested or charged with a crime then invoke your 5th amendment right. But keep it simple and never answer any questions LEO ask you.

You should be able to call the NC Sora office and ask this as a hypothetical question.

I have family and friends here in Vegas but it was still very helpful, since my PO denied living with any of them.  They took I think 25% of my paycheck (gross not net, pfft!) but 3 meals a day and a place to sleep.  And it was a ton of freedom compared to prison.

I knew a couple guys in prison that didn't want to go to a HWH, we all thought they were nuts lol.  I could have a portable dvd player, smartphone, order pizza, etc.  And we got to leave to job hunt like...4-5 days a week for 8 hours each.  And after a week or so you could get 2 recreation days, also 8 hours each.

I believe you need to ask for/apply for halfway house when you're about a year out.  If he's federal (or either way) have him ask his counselor or case manager about it.

Long story short, he was going through a depressive episode, and, with a background in law enforcement and criminology degrees, he decided to do online predator catches on his own. Instead of talking to anyone about it, he decided to gather information on his own to give to authorities instead of involving them first or whatever. 

Kind of what some famous youtubers are doing now, except alone with no cameras or audio. We both have the same opinion on sex offenders and it has been proven, so I know it's the truth.

Since then, I’ve worked hard to better myself—returning to school to earn my high school diploma, enrolling in college, and committing to personal growth.

Two registered sex offenders who were living in the same home in Bellingham, Washington were murdered in 2005 by a man who gained access to their residence by claiming to be an FBI agent investigating threats made against sex offenders. Hank Eisses, 49, and Victor Vasquez, 68, were gunned down by Michael Anthony Mullen, who later confessed to the crime. Mullen was convicted and sentenced to 44 years; he died in prison.  



Stephen A. Marshall, 20, a Canadian citizen, used information from online registries to locate two sex offenders in Maine, killing them in separate incidents in April 2006. William Elliot, 24, and Joseph Gray, 57, were shot to death. Marshall killed himself as police closed in while he was on a bus. Following the murders, Maine officials stated they did not intend to make any changes to the state’s sex offender registry. https://www.vice.com/en/article/how-sex-offender-registries-can-result-in-vigilante-murder/   



In August 2011, John Joseph Huffmaster, 29, of Hazelwood, Missouri, was charged with assaulting his 74-year-old neighbor with a hammer because the neighbor was on a sex offender registry. Huffmaster, who entered the victim’s home by asking for a cup of sugar, called police after the attack to claim he was “doing God’s work.” Police found the victim, semi-conscious and bleeding, with multiple skull and facial fractures.   


Patrick Drum was sentenced to life in prison in September 2012 for killing two registered sex offenders in Washington state. His victims were Gary Lee Blanton, 28, and Jerry Wayne Ray, 57, who were fatally shot in June 2012. Drum reportedly admitted that he was targeting sex offenders and planned to continue killing them until he was caught.



 On June 25, 2016, Anchorage, Alaska police arrested Jason Vukovich, 41, for assaulting three registered sex offenders. The first victim, Charles Albee, told police a man with “shoulder-length hair and a black leather jacket” broke into his apartment, assaulted him and robbed him. The man knew his name and told him he was there because Albee was on the registry. He also showed Albee a notebook with a list of additional potential victims.

lyge0r5,comment,,"Empathy and non-judgment are cornerstones of a kinder, more compassionate world, and they must be nurtured from the earliest stages of education. Starting in preschool and kindergarten, children can be taught to see others not through the lens of mistakes or differences, but through shared humanity. These lessons can be woven into every grade, reinforcing the idea that everyone deserves understanding and a chance to thrive.

Education has the power to fundamentally change how we view and treat each other. Imagine if, instead of being quick to judge or punish, we were taught to pause, listen, and consider the circumstances that led someone to make a mistake. When children learn these skills early, they carry them into adulthood, creating a society that values helping over harming.

This is especially crucial for people who’ve committed offenses. Their actions don’t define their worth, and with support and opportunities, they can rebuild their lives. Everyone is entitled to a good life, but we can only achieve that if we’re willing to lend a hand instead of turning away. Empathy taught in schools can plant seeds of understanding that grow into a society where helping one another becomes second nature. That’s the world we should strive for.",2,,2024-11-22 18:33:54,t3_1gxdlm0,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gxdlm0/the_registry_kills/lyge0r5/

lygl3gk,comment,,"Unfortunately correct. I could not post anymore but the second link has a better read to it. I do not think that there is a database of PRFs being assaulted or killed due to the registry.

Just remain vigilant and stay safe. Protect yourself if you can and record confrontation. Also, join or support advocacy groups. Also, there are a great many people who do not care about the registry, however, it gets shoved down their throats as they have ""the right to know"" who you are.

""See you perverts later,"" Jeremy Moody shouted at Charles Parker's family as he walked out of court. ""That's what child molesters get.""

And as Christine Moody walked in shackles to a police car outside of the courthouse, she told reporters: ""Killing that pedophile was the best day of my life.""

Those cases are 15 pages of the 184 page document I’ve written concerning the injustice, inefficiency, research on recidivism, statistics, likelihood of sex crimes occurring in places registrants are typically banned from, data on rearrests for technical registry violations, the financial cost of the registry, the variance in state laws, the impossibility of being able to follow the laws in certain states, the effect ok employment, the occurrence of recidivism when people are employed, houses, and have a support system vs those who do not have one or more of those things, the counter productivity, the constitutional violations, what the funds spent on the registry could be used for to prevent crimes in the first place, the manipulation involved in stings, the inordinate occurrence of people with low IQ’s, learning disorders, and autism being targets of stings, the number of minors affected by the registry, better ways to deal with crimes that were committed, specifics on the motivation (financial grants, etc…) encouraging departments to create more arrests, fbi crime stats, etc… it’s still mostly an outline. I imagine it’ll hit 1000 or more pages of if I decide to complete it. 

But, yeah, 15 pages are cases where registrants were targeted and killed, where people who were mistaken for registrants were targeted and killed, where a house was burned down to kill a registrant who no longer lived there but that address was still listed on some website somewhere and the elderly woman who lived there died.

I’m mostly worried because he’s the type of person who won’t want to ‘burden’ us so I suspect he’ll just ‘suffer’ instead of charging us for collect calls and such. So we don’t know how we can get in contact to tell him things if we don’t have inmate numbers or anything.

lz3m9xo,comment,,"You would think it’s pretty easy when they make it a point to reach out to only those who have put themselves out there as someone who is seeking an adult man to meet for sexual purposes. Nobody assumes that there are kids luring men in this way to solicit them to meet for sexual purposes. 🤦🏻‍♀️
And when the decoy does change their role to pretend to be a kid, after they clearly first posed as an adult and lured men in this way, of course, that it is going to be very confusing to any normal mind. All the men know is that this is a person who likes to play games. They’re not an honest person. So, how is anybody supposed to know which parts of what the decoy says are true or not? You can’t know who this really is or what they really mean or not, unless you show up to meet them in person. That’s the only way anybody can know for sure. It’s that simple. It’s common sense! 🤦🏻‍♀️
And if the decoys require the men to play along with the narrative the decoy has created in order to agree to meet the men, then there is absolutely nothing wrong with anybody playing along with the decoy, because the decoy made that a requirement. No real kid would have ever done that. And even if a real kid would have made a sexual conversation a requirement (for whatever very odd reason), that still doesn’t mean that kid or the men were serious about it. 🤦🏻‍♀️😂

In fact, it’s very common to predators to use “role-playing” as a tactic to groom their victims, and the predator will ALWAYS assign what role who plays. In the online sting operation, the decoy ALWAYS assign what role they will each play.

m032s69,comment,,"Law enforcement is not really interested in those cases - the ones that parents report to them. They don’t want to put in the effort to solve real crime or stop real abuse. That’s why those cases have actually increased since these sting operations became so widespread. So, there’s more victimization of this kind BECAUSE of these online sting operations - kids being lured online by adults, to be exploited, and that is because these online sting operations are simply not conducted in the places where those types of adults seek underage individuals for that. Nor are these sting operations conducted correctly, and it’s very much done intentionally. 

 It’s just much easier for law enforcement to just create fake crimes and pretend to solve it. Our federal ICAC grant program greatly rewards them for this, and a lot of it has a lot to do with Tim Ballard and others of his kind. In Texas, the Texas statute changed in 2016, to accommodate the online sting operation scam. Before that, it had to be a real minor, not an adult pretending to be a minor. I’m pretty sure it was done the same in other states. The laws were adjusted in order to make them fitting to this scam. Remember, Tim Ballard began grooming our federal government in 2015, to interject himself and his fraudulent organization (O.U.R.) in federal government functions to supposedly help save trafficked victims. His goal was to drive up the number of these cases, to create widespread paranoia in order to get people to believe that donating to his fraudulent organization was going to help keep their kids safer online. It was all a big lie. It all ties to the QAnon stuff too and more - like Thom Harrison who wrote the book Visions of Glory - which is tied to people who have committed heinous crimes. You can look up that stuff.

So, the intent for adjusting these laws that are wrongly applied to these cases was so that these laws could be applied to those adults who targeted underage individuals online to exploit in this way, but now an adult could actually pose as underage - with the intent to be targeted by those adults who were seeking underage individuals to exploit. 
This adjustment of these laws was NOT intended so that adult decoys could target men on adult hookup sites - men who were clearly NOT seeking underage individuals for this. It was NOT intended so that those men could be lured with ADULT profiles or ADULT ads - using sex as their primary tactic to lure those men - and then change their role to pretend to be underage, only AFTER they used an adult profile or ad and sex to lure those men, and also while still pushing sex on those random adult male strangers that no real child would have ever lured in this way and done this to. 

So, you see how these online sting operations have absolutely NOTHING to do with trying to save protect children? Many of the earlier sting operations from the earlier 2000s were legit because those were conducted in chat rooms that were not specifically designed for adults or adult content. Those were open to anybody and everybody - no matter what age, etc. The sting operations conducted after the online adult hookup and adult content sites began are just not the same thing at all. The chats are forensically  different in the sting operations from the early 2000s compared to those later conducted with men who were lured from adult hookup sites. 

We need new laws that make it illegal for sick, twisted adults to lure men from those adult content sites, to suggest and encourage them to do these things with an underage person instead of with an adult, like those men were looking for. The men were in the right place for what they were seeking - which clearly would be a like-minded, consensual adult. There is no valid reason for any decoy to lure them to force their own narrative (pdf file fantasies) on those men who were not looking for that, and encourage them to play along with that narrative. Those sting operations are NOT legit. All men who were lured in this way are NOT GUILTY because it was the decoy who created the role play and assigned the roles they would each play. The Predator always forces the role play on the victim and assigns what part they will each will play. Therefore, in the current sting operations, the decoys are the real Predator, and the men they target and lure with adult profiles are the real victims.

No man who was lured in that way could have known for sure if this person was lying about being an adult or lying about being underage. The only way they can know for sure is to play along with the narrative the decoy creates and forces on them, because that is the only way the decoy will agree to meet in person, so that the men can see for themselves who this person really is. This is the only way those men could find out why this person was lying to them or playing games like that. The only thing the men know for sure is that this person is not honest or simply enjoys that type of role play.

I have e a friend who was trapped on there on 2019. The police officers had targeted before on there in sex chat groups. They had role played with him before l, never claiming to be a minor. Then those police officers created a sex chat room and him and other men to that chat room. It was called something After Dark, which is a typical phrase used in the names for sex chats. It was in that chat that they then claimed to be 15, and they of course continued to push the sex talk and to push for meeting him for a casual sexual hookup. This is how they entrap the men.

lyenros,comment,,"Hard to give advice because the story wasn’t clear.  If this was a dating situation, then I would advise disclosing sooner than 3 months. If it was just a casual friendship, no romance/no sex — just friends, then you didn’t owe an explanation of your past.  If once she found out she bolted, you would have lost her as a friend anyway.   If it’s simply a friendship situation, you do not have to explain your crime or be out on the defensive.    You owe something to people you hurt and to people you have a  romantic with …but you don’t owe it to anyone else. At issue is who you are today— not who you were when you committed the offense.  

Given the number of people with sexual trauma in their history, my guess is that learning about your offense trigger some response in her based on her own history and it had more to do with her not having processed her own past.  

Always take accountability and responsibility—100%—- but you shouldn’t have to live in 2nd class state forever asking people who weren’t there for forgiveness.",5,,2024-11-22 12:46:38,t3_1gx1oz4,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gx1oz4/be_up_front_about_your_charges/lyenros/

If you go around telling everyone right away, many people will have kneejerk reactions and write you off immediately, and not even try to get to know you.  

Honestly, if she has no kids or anything relevant, it's none of her business.  It's not your job to tell EVERYone unless it actually comes up.  If you want to, fine, do it when feel like you should.  Do you really think she has nothing in her past that's shameful, embarrassing, or even illegal?

If you are not in a relationship yet or not considered dating (which to me is weird if that is the goal), then I don't feel you are under obligation to tell her.  Even when dating, if its casual or you don't know if you are going to have an exclusive future, I would wait until it seems like a sure thing.  Its just that she found out.  So hopefully you let her know and let her know that she's important to you and that you come with baggage.

Surprisingly it hasn't been much of an issue for me.  I had the same charge over 10 years ago and am just finishing probation.  The only time it became a problem was when there were arguments in a relationship, or me internalizing it and putting up with things I shouldn't have in the relationship from me devaluing myself due to that.",-1,,2024-11-22 14:46:53,t3_1gx1oz4,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gx1oz4/be_up_front_about_your_charges/lyf6ls1/
lyfj4jr,comment,,"I think because you had romantic intentions, (regardless of being okay if it was just friends! But you had an attraction to this woman, yes?) absolutely disclose your past. My partner did with me BEFORE we even got close as friends, because he knew he was attracted to me and he was hopeful that it would turn into something more.

He immediately told me I think the second week of us interacting with each other (we met at work.) and we met up outside of work so I could fully hear him out.

I understand wanting to find that deep connection, and somebody willing to be judgement free about your past. It feels slim now, especially with the way the world is, but I promise you, your person is out there.

I think if it’s a work connection/professional environment, you do not owe anybody an explanation of your past.

However, I will go against the grain here as I see the other comments saying if you’re just friends, it doesn’t matter. I think it does matter still. Not as intense as it would a romantic partnership, but platonic relationships are just as important in regard of trust, and building a lasting friendship. Even if my partner and I had no romantic attraction, I was grateful that he still disclosed his past to me as a friend first, because it showed me his accountability, as well as his assurance of himself.

Having your past really limits the pool when it comes to dating and friendship, but I promise you, good people are out there!!

But if they don't you have companionship, a partner, good things in your life.

lyff6vo,comment,,"I disagree. It is unfair to them for two reasons. One, it's just dishonest and that's no way to build a relationship, it's not like you are not telling the other person that you don't like chocolate chip cookies, this is something that impacts almost all aspects of our lives and those around us. That brings me to number two, being around us or being associated with us can adversely impact their lives and it is unfair to them to allow them to be blindsided by this information. 

While I agree that we shouldn't ""be at the bottom of every totem pole"", the fact is that in the current climate we are viewed as sub-human and acting like we are not is just kidding ourselves. 

I have a number of very close relationships and they are aware of my past and that I have been through years of therapy, and that I am not a bad person, they don't know the details of what I did, but they could look it up if they really wanted to know. I have also lost a number of relationships and I understand why and I don't really blame them, they are just reacting as society has taught them and at the end of the day I wouldn't want to maintain a relationship with them if they were secretly harboring negative feelings towards me. 

I do not divulge this information when I first meet them but if the relationship starts to build I do once I feel like they can take the information in and actually process it instead of just reacting to it. As far as dating, I am married so fortunately I don't have to deal with that, but I would take the same approach, see how it worked and if it blew up in my face, try something different. 

I have found that most people who learn about my charges, which is hands off and doesn't include cp, mostly want to know what it was like in prison more than anything, maybe I am just lucky though.",3,,2024-11-22 15:34:39,t1_lye9wpo,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gx1oz4/be_up_front_about_your_charges/lyff6vo/

There will be some that need to know everything (family, partners, potential partners, etc.). Then others that will need to know something but don't necessarily need to know all of the intimate details (friends with minor children for example). Then others that really don't need to know anything. 

I guess it's up to each of us to decide who's in that final group. I can see close friends, even if they don't have minor children being given some information at some point.

This new book they have, basically says you can't flirt with anyone, or be sexual without being in a committed relationship. Can't send sexual texts, can't have casual hookups. Basically not allowed to pursue any new relationships without a long-term commitment.

Do I like it? No. Is it realistic? Not really. Nothing about the registry is realistic. The entire system is designed to punish us by making life next to impossible.

I'm just trying to follow the rules, no matter how harsh or absurd they may be. In reality, a lot of women don't want long-term relationships. Especially with guys who are RSO's. 

The entire concept of the registry is self-defeating. It's not fair. But I've accepted that it's my fault and these are the consequences I have for my unacceptable behavior.

Celibacy is the only way I can guarantee my freedom.

Bullshit excuse that has been used to justify discrimination and tons of atrocities throughout history. At a time when RSO's are being gunned down and being castrated and murdered, I'm pretty much over excuses. 

Unless you are in a serious relationship or are dealing with immediate family, there is no obligation to tell anyone anything. You don't owe people anything, any real friend or partner would be willing to look past an offense if you already paid the price and are working to better yourself. 

OP never had a shot, and if the woman says that she is almost certainly lying. one thing that he is reasonably dishonest about, and she jumps ship? Never had a future imo. 

I am sure anyone with common sense can figure out why he wasn't open with it in the first 3 months. The first 3 months are supposed to be a time where you are at your happiest with your partner, it genuienly isn't the time where you are super serious. You're usually just ""seeing someone.""

I really should not be on the registry in VA. For a tier 1 I would need 3 counts of sexual battery. I only have 1 charge of indecent assault (groping) but since I chose to serve and protect the country they decided to put me on there. It wasn't even a registerable offense until 2007. Basically anything sexual in the military you have to be on the registry. A great way to thank the veterans. Smh 🙄 🙄 a lil misdemeanor and 20 years later and employers still are not hiring me. In VA they are including non sexual offenses on the registry. Sometimes I think it's just an excuse to spy on Americans more.
I seen one state where just making sex sounds can land a person on the registry. It was intended to protect children but now a quarter of the registry is made up of children.

It contradicts itself a lot. I just think it's crazy I can only flirt with someone once I'm in a relationship. Can't hook up, be fwb, only one partner etc.

Everybody knows this is way off from the modern dating atmosphere. It's bad enough being a RSO but I'm also expected to be a prude.

Typically women still expect guys to make the first move.

Voluntarily celibate is simpler for me.

lyfcd67,comment,,"In a world where a better mate is just a swipe away, you need an advantage to keep a partner from looking elsewhere.

I agree, women looking for resources are usually shitty, but at the end of the day, you gotta ask yourself what do you have (looks, charisma, loyalty, resources etc) that they aren't going to seek out elsewhere, from someone who doesn't have the baggage of being a RSO?

Being a partner of an RSO is a *tremendous* burden. What do you have to offer that's going to motivate them to look past that? Without *that*, whatever it may be, odds are slim to none of it working out longterm.

Resources are a tremendous advantage in life that you can build for yourself. Unless you live completely 'off the grid', they are a basic necessity to everyday life. You're going to have a hard time if you're not motivated to accumulate them.

The treatment is mandatory and it's a probation violation to be kicked out of it, and polygraphs are integrated into it too, so it's in my best interest just to follow the rules.

I had no idea about any of this before taking the plea, but it's kinda late to do anything about it now..

I'm not saying it's not batshit. It's just the rules I've been given, as consequences for breaking the law. The easiest, simplest way to stay out of trouble is to simply avoid taking any risks.

Being intimate with someone new is incredibly risky in my particular situation, along with many others, I'm sure. For me, it's just not worth it.

Realistically, it's going to be incredibly difficult to have any relationship without being able to show s**ual interest.

lzg4lx9,comment,,"Every country has their stigma when it comes to certain crimes. We are lucky in America we don't do to certain sex offenders that other countries would. Some immediately sentence them to death with or without conviction. Some castrate the offender physically or chemically or lock them up and throw away the key.
And whether they get released from said country, they still have the stigma of being a sex offender whether they're on the registry or not, if said country has one since majority now do, even if it's private for all offenders. 
Main problem I see with how we treat with RSO's in this country is the housing availability. Most people can only afford to rent and are usually turned away from majority of housing when applying for a rental, all because they are on the registry. Why do I see that as a problem for them? 
Since they have already done their time and if they aren't on a life long probation, how is it they can turn away an offender even though there is no law that says they can? If the offender is registering as they're supposed to and otherwise meets the credentials for the rental, and their probation, whether or not they have one, doesn't disagree with their move they should be allowed in.
I'm a second chance believer but these companies and people think they can just turn someone down for housing just because they're on the registry keeps them from being properly housed. Which means they have higher chances of being homeless and higher chances of reoffending or getting hit with a failure to register and going back anyway.
Sorry for the book. This is the main thing I feel for the RSO's because they get hit the hardest even though they have proven themselves to society.",1,,2024-11-28 19:01:57,t1_lym9tdn,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gx1oz4/be_up_front_about_your_charges/lzg4lx9/

Not quite sure how I'm gonna be able to get in any kind of relationship if I'm not allowed to show s**ual interest. Basically I'm supposed to wait for a woman to make advances towards me, the way I understand it.

And part of the treatment is polygraphs, that if I can't pass, I'll be removed from the treatment. If I'm removed from the treatment, not sure what happens since it's required as a condition of probation, so I'm guessing my freedom depends on it.

However, OP clearly intended to have a long lasting relationship with this woman, regardless if it was going to stay platonic or end up romantic. OP even stated repeatedly that they were going to come clean rather soon (my assumption on that is about a couple of weeks, or even a week, I obviously don’t know) so again, wanting to keep her around in their life for a while. If that’s the case, it’d be understandable that the woman would’ve wanted something to be mentioned sooner, especially if she ever expressed having a romantic interest back to OP within those three months (flirting, etc.). There is a chance things could have been different if he had told her up front.

In the end we’ll never know.

Once approved, the notice is published in a local newspaper weekly for six weeks, and after that, it’s considered legally served so your case can move forward.

Work closely with your attorney to get the process right, and document everything. If the no-contact order makes this harder, ask about modifying it just for child-related communication. Be prepared for the court to appoint a Guardian ad Litem to represent your child’s best interests and show them you’re serious about being a responsible parent.

I'm wondering if he would be able to file a motion to modify the no-contact order without charging me since it's related to the case I already paid him for. The no-contact order is on the Mother of my child and her family but our child is part of her family.

Would you happen to know if I would have to file the affidavit as well as the Motion? I've never been in legal trouble until I got my charge last year so I'm completely lost. My PO and counselor are trying to see what they can come up with to help point me in the right direction but so far they told me to contact my attorney who handled my case. My PO also told me to just put down the last known address for the Mother that way at least the affidavit is filed. The messed up part is I have had an active child support order through the same court that deals with visitations so they have the current address for the Mother but when I asked if they could put the address down after I filed they told me they couldn't do that. I'm curious if I put the last known address and it comes back as non-deliverable if they would then look up her current address to send it to her.

When I contacted my local Domestic Relations court and explained I was wanting to file for visitations they had me pick up a packet (affidavit) and it's $100 to file that but if I only have to file a motion I'd like to try to save the $100 from filing the affidavit.

Ask your attorney who to go to, they will know who the respected providers are in your area.  

You can Google what they entail, but every provider is a little different.  They’re usually very thorough and, while I don’t know how all providers do it, not generally done in just one day by the ones that I know. 

Re: therapy - from what I understand, with federal charges there’s no fee, they cover it.  With state charges you do have to pay for it. Some states have programs to help pay for it if you can’t afford it, but I don’t think that most states do. Some health insurance will cover it, but I think that’s also relatively rare. 

Monitoring - again, will depend on which state. I think if it’s federal they cover it, but I’m not sure on that.  In the state I am in you go back to prison if you don’t pay for it, same with therapy. It very much depends on where you are and if the charges are state or federal. 

It’s expensive to be on probation or parole. Some people are paying $700 or more a month for monitoring and therapy.

My public defender setup my appointment and is was fairly painless, just tell him to be prepared for a lot of very personal and uncomfortable questions. I was brutally honest in mine and was deemed ""not a threat"" while on pre-trail and allowed to have supervised contact with my daughter who was eight at the time. I released almost a month ago and still retain my joint custody of my daughter (13 now) with my ex-wife. I made a comment in your other thread but you need to make sure you ask your lawyer about post-release stipulations, a lot of guys don't ask and have a hard time getting to see and/or live with their biological children.

The court ordered therapy, I can only speak from my state (Florida) but we are required to pay for it, as well as monitoring software and polygraph testing. I have not gone through any of these yet other than the monitoring and it cost me roughly $60 a month for two devices (Computer and Smart Phone). I believe there is some assistance that can be given if the family is unable to pay the full amount, but the reality is, if convicted, this is a stipulation of his release back into society and as such it's his obligation to pay for all needed treatment and monitoring. The same goes for restitution, if ordered to pay.

I know it's rough to go through this but the more you prepare yourself ahead of time the better you will be in the long run. I would highly recommend finding a therapist to talk to about the situation as it is extremely stressful on the spouse. If that is not within your budget, there are support groups for families/spouses of RSOs that are free and I've heard can be very helpful. I believe you can find these groups on the ACSOL website. If you are a religious, there are also support groups at Celebrate Recovery, which is a faith-based program churches run. You should be able to find these in your area by searching Google.

Questions about how old you were when you first masturbated. First sexual contact with another person. # of partners. Stability of intimate relationships. Viewed pornography. Frequency of masturbation, sexual fantasies. They'll ask about your employment history. Friends/social supports.

Not knowing the law is not a defense. 

This is going to sound mean, and I’ll admit it’s not the nicest way I could deliver it. But I think that you need to hear it before you screw your entire entire life up. 

Your excuses are bullshit. You can sit and say “I didn’t know this, I didn’t know that,” all day long. Not knowing the law is not defense for breaking it. You absolutely knew what you were doing wasn’t right. 

You said you knew the age of consent is 16 so you didn’t think it was illegal. It doesn’t matter. She didn’t consent to you sending this video to people, did she?  So the fact that you were basing it on the age of consent your state is completely invalid. Even if it hadn’t been illegal for you to send because she is a minor, it still would’ve been illegal because she didn’t consent to you sending that video out. 

Absolutely nobody is going to buy that you were trying to do some kind of good thing by sending a humiliating video of somebody doing something sexual that you didn’t think they should be doing. There is absolutely not one tiny no bit of logic in that. If you were trying to do a good thing and tell somebody they shouldn’t have been doing something that they’re doing you’d just say it. 

I’m going to give you a little life lesson about lying. Don’t. You’re not good at it. You already told on yourself a couple of comments ago when you said that the reason you did it was to make fun of them. Now you’re turning around and saying you did it out of some sort of moral responsibility. 

When people lie, they don’t remember the lies that they told. It’s easy to remember the truth, because it’s what actually happened. It’s not easy to remember the exact lie that you’ve told two weeks ago, two years ago, or apparently even two hours ago. 

I don’t know if you misworded it or not, but you said “I didn’t think it was nude,”  if it was nude, nobody’s going to buy that you thought that it wasn’t. 

If you walk into a courtroom with a whole bunch of excuses, like you’re spewing here it is probably not going to go well for you. 

I have a few friends who are judges. Every single one of them would tell you that the most annoying thing in the world to them is when people come in and make a bunch of excuses, especially ones that don’t make any sense and try to play it off like they just didn’t know it was wrong. People respect accountability, they don’t respect bullshit. 

Do you know how this will affect her life? Here are a few things people go through after things like this - 

They can lose college scholarships. 

They can be rejected from colleges. 

They can lose job opportunities. 

It affects their dating life. 

They may lose friends. 

For obvious reasons, it’s going to cause depression and mental health issues, probably some panic and anxiety. 

You sent this to people that she knows. These are high school age kids, so I’m going assume a whole lot of people at school about this. This doesn’t go away. 

I graduated high school 30 years ago.  At my 20th class reunion, a girl showed up we hadn’t seen in years. In high school, did some things that were videotaped on a VHS camcorder. There was one single copy of it. Not that many people saw it.  Maybe 10? I never saw it, I just heard about it. So did everyone else. 

There were a lot of people in my graduating class.  I think close to 500, about 200 were at the reunion. People started whispering and snickering when she came in and people were openly making fun of her for it. Twenty years later. 

And people still mention it sometimes.  

I have a client who was in school to become a nurse anesthetist. She attended a very religious university, where you had to sign a morality clause.  In her last semester of school, a video surfaced that was many years old. It was sent around to several people who sent it to several more people. She was kicked out of school for that video.  Not only did she not get to graduate, she was saddled with over $100k in student loans. Because she was kicked out of the program, it took years for her to find another school that would allow her in to their program and she had to start over. 

Most adults know people this has happened to.  It can affect your life in ways I’m sure you didn’t consider when you did it, but this is the result of that. 

Don’t make excuses for it. Own it. Encourage everyone who has a copy to delete it and to have anyone they sent it to delete it. This shouldn’t be too difficult to do since they can be charged for possession by having it. Her luckiest break is that she was a minor so it’ll be a bit easier to get rid of if it’s not circulated too much and she can have anyone who shares or uses it arrested for it, easily. 

But it doesn’t change the impact on her life or that it could limit her for years to come. 

This is why it’s as serious as it is. Having something like that out there is not too dissimilar from being on the registry. Worrying that people know, that they’re staring, that they’ll find out and tell people or shun them, that they could lose a job, that friends may vanish, that people will never see them the same way again. 

So, stop with the bullshit excuses and take responsibility for what you’ve done. I’m not saying you deserve to go to prison or end up on the registry for life, but minimizing your actions is not going to do you any favors in court.",12,,2024-11-21 23:17:28,t1_lyb1uli,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gwmdjs/plea/lybsols/

ly9rh6n,comment,,"Firearms are tricky. We always were explicit about the access. Firearms needed to be secured and in such a way that the supervised person had no access. If this was violated, guns get seized. So yes. Worth double checking. Regarding the visit otherwise, has there been a previous visit to approve the residence pre-release? If no, you'll probably get a lot information about the conditions, what is, is not allowed. Contact restrictions, if any, etc. I also wanted a walk through of the house, what room the supervised person will be in, what areas of the residence they will have access to or not. Pets, other people that live there. How long, if you're just helping, the person can stay.

The way I got through it was realizing that when you are on parole or probation, you are still incarcerated, you just have different rules. 

You can be violated at any time and, in San Diego, spend 10 days in jail before seeing a judge for an arraignment.

Because of this, I spent a great deal of time and $ in court seeing the judge to get restrictions removed. The less restrictions, the lower chance of a violation.

I suggest this to everyone. Go to court. File motions to reduce restrictions. I was very transparent with my PO. I’d ask, get told no, then explain I would file, was told that’s my right.

Only bring in your keys, drivers license, and cash/coins/card in a clear plastic bag (ziploc is perfect). Nothing else can come in. Leave phone, purse, etc in the car. 

You will need to have his inmate number, along with your car’s license plate number when you fill out your paperwork. 

If you have any medication, metal in your body, require the use of crutches/wheelchair, or have a cast, you will need to provide a letter from a doctor. 

Do not wear:
Shorts (men or women)
Leggings
Skirts/dresses above the knee
Low cut tops
Crocs
Bra with underwire (this will set off the metal detector and they will not let you in)

Avoid clothing that is tan in color

ly9qyaj,comment,,"Please know that I’m not saying this to be mean, you’re asking for realistic expectations and I’m giving you the best advice I can. 

I know you believe he’s innocent, I know hearing it is going to hurt, but at some point you’re going to have to realize that the chance he’s innocent is so minuscule that it’s pretty much nonexistent. 

You posted all the details as to how and why he couldn’t possibly have done it and were upset his attorney wouldn’t listen to the evidence you have that makes it obvious he’s innocent. All those details, the bittorrents, the thumbnails left in his cache, etc… prove guilt, not innocence. People do not just accidentally download CSAM while looking for free movies to watch with their significant other while they’re on maternity leave. 

He may be a great dad.  He may never harm his daughter. A lot of people who view it never act on it and never would. But many do. Your daughter isn’t old enough to speak, she can’t tell you. But it’s pretty concerning that he started watching it when she was born (according to what you listed the evidence was) 

The fact that you’ve been manipulated in to thinking that the things that make him very clearly guilty to the rest of us, are what shows he has to be innocent, is a huge problem. My heart legitimately hurts for you that you’re sitting there having been convinced those things prove innocence when they prove guilt. 

No judge, no prosecutor, no attorney, no detective, no anybody who knows how this works is going to believe he’s innocent if your description of the evidence is accurate. And I cannot imagine that they would allow him to be around her while he’s insisting those things, or until he’s had a risk evaluations done, and has been through treatment. 

It doesn’t mean he’s a monster. It does mean he needs help, he needs risk evaluations, and he needs treatment. 

I can’t tell you what will happen, but I can tell you it’s unlikely he will be allowed to be around her until he has the evaluations. It’s possible he may not see her until after treatment (depending on the results of the testing). This results will dictate a lot of things. He may be able to come home at some point, but he may also never be allowed to be alone with her again until she’s an adult. 

It’s rare for people to make it through SOT if they don’t admit to what they did. In fact, I don’t think it’s even possible to make it though without being honest about that. 

Nobody can give you those answers.  But, please please,  find a counselor for yourself who can help you navigate this. And it might be a good idea to sit down with someone who can explain how the technology works and the likelihood of accidentally downloading CSAM videos on multiple different days when “looking for free movies….” so that you can understand it know what you’re dealing with. That’s what’s best for your little girl. 

I wish you the very, very best, I genuinely do.",17,,2024-11-21 16:59:08,t3_1gwhnts,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gwhnts/biological_child_question/ly9qyaj/

lyacfz3,comment,,"I only know some secondhand stuff from my therapist, but I think with computer CP crimes it's usually not a big hurdle for a SO to see their children.  At least here in NV.  I know of several people who, after prison, had new kids and their PO basically just allowed it.  Now, they may have needed to go to their boss or a judge or something, and they might've already been dealing with the SO for years so they didn't need any more work, I'm not sure.

I've also heard of a few cases where someone had to complete a chaperone course, but that was only like...a month.  Or, there could be a chaperone agreement, which would detail rules and restrictions.  Like maybe he wouldn't be allowed to be home alone w/ his kid, or couldn't change the diapers or something.

Also this could all be changed in the future.  So even if there are a bunch of onerous restrictions at first, they could always lessen over time.  The court and POs are always strictest at first when they don't know the SO.  Best thing to do is follow the rules and not cause any problems.

ly9vlte,comment,,"I started an LLC. I got business cards and started leaving them at homes that were in obvious need of work (mostly lawn, but also painting, roof & gutter cleaning, fence repair etc.)

The business cards are like $25 for 1000 at office depot, and can be printed the same day.

For me, this has been a lot easier than dealing with background checks, allowed me to make my own schedule and get paid considerably more than $10 an hour.

Realistically, after taxes/SS/Medicare etc, $10 an hour ain't gonna cut it even working 30-40 hours a week.

I paid $300 to file the LLC with the state and like $80 a month for liability insurance.

My income varies a lot from month to month. Some months are obviously better than others, but I net about 2000 every month, after insurance/fuel etc, doing like 100 hours of labor.

A basic pickup truck is necessary for me though. There are some old 1998-2003 4.6L V8 F-150's are known to go 500k+ miles when properly maintained. My neighbor has one he rolled over the odometer (>1m mi) and it's still going lol.

Carcomplaints website has loads of data on older vehicles that are known to be (un)reliable, and shows what problems are common with certain year/make/models. A reliable pickup truck is a must if you start your own business like I did.

A flexible work schedule also allows me to take classes and get certificates. I do have a nice collection of tools though, and I've watched countless hours from University of youtube on tutorials of things from mowing lawns to building fences.

IMO, tools are a solid investment. If you find good ones cheap enough on offer up, it's hard to lose money on them. They will always be needed and only go up in price with inflation. 

I have dollies, saws, hammers, lawnmower, blower, weed eater, drills, batteries etc.",1,,2024-11-21 17:22:18,t3_1gvvt8m,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gvvt8m/needing_advice_due_to_pending_charges/ly9vlte/

The prosecution dropped two felonies for a guilty plea.  

I think they would have struggled to prove those charges. The prosecution was stacking charges.l but still, those felonies would have added 5+ years to my sentence.

The prosecution wanted 3 years (middle), max was 5 years.

It was my first offense. 

Judge gave me probation. To say the prosecutor was upset was an understatement. 

The judge said, “I’m leaning towards probation…prosecution, I’ll give you 2 mins to argue against this.”

The prosecutor then went on to lie about the victims age - reducing it by 3 years, lied that I had used force (there was none), said I was an evil genius who tricked the psych they selected, and a few more random juicy tidbits.

The judge looked at my attorney. All my attorney said is “Those were some very inflammatory and incorrect statements. The victim was not xx but yy and we could go on.”

The judge held up his hand and said probation.

I know if I had put my victim on the stand I would have done 3+ years and probation too.

Unless the plea deal specifies a specific punishment, you do still “negotiate” with the judge at sentencing, where you put on your mitigation and argue for a sentence that you’re wanting and the government argues their side as well.

lxyb4kj,comment,,"The law states 48 hours. Not 2 business days. It cant be held against you for trying to comply with the law when you physically can't, so in situations like an office being closed they cant file charges against you for failing to register. That doesn't change what the law actually states. Absolutely no where in Nevada's law, as you can read for yourself, does it make a distinction of business days in terms of registration or updating any part of your registration. 

In your example, even though it wasn't ""accepted,"" you completed the notification of the new email with your email to the office within the 48-hour period, and then actually you completed the update to your registration when next able to do so when the office next opened. 

Even though the officer told you its business days, the law, as proven, doesn't state that anywhere in terms of updating registration. It states 48 hours, period. 

Keep arguing and referring to your personal experience all you want. The law states otherwise. And, having an impossibility to comply situation, like a closed office, doesn't change what the law states.

lxtku2g,comment,,"This was actually discussed recently, though I forget which state was mentioned. That state's supreme court was called to answer whether an RSOs can be evicted from a residence they owned if a daycare or school opened nearby. The court said they could still own the property, but could not reside there. It distinguished between the constitutional right to own property, and what it considered not a constitutional right to maintain a residence.

So yes, in my non-lawyer opinion, I would say that legal precedent in most jurisdictions you can infer the right own property anywhere, and in that particular state it's actually codified.

lxsiy6y,comment,,"I feel the same sometimes..I will tell you tho, living with shame is like carrying an invisible weight—it chips away at your sense of self-worth and holds you back from experiencing life fully. Shame isn’t just an unpleasant feeling; it’s a deeply personal, often hidden emotion that tells you something is wrong with who you are, not just what you’ve done. And that’s dangerous because it keeps you stuck in a cycle of self-doubt and negativity.

When you carry shame for too long, it can affect your mental health, leading to anxiety, depression, or even isolation. It makes it harder to connect with others because you might fear judgment or rejection. Plus, shame often causes people to avoid dealing with the root of the problem, so it festers instead of healing.

What’s healthier is embracing vulnerability. When you face shame with honesty and self-compassion, you can let it go, piece by piece. No one’s perfect, and it’s through our flaws that we grow and connect with others. Shame thrives in silence, but when you talk about it—whether with a friend, therapist, or even just yourself—it starts to lose its power over you. It’s like shining a light in a dark room; it doesn’t seem as scary anymore.",19,,2024-11-18 18:10:21,t3_1gub1j7,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gub1j7/new_rso/lxsiy6y/

Shame work is so important. Shame will keep you stuck in unhealthy cycles and keep you in that depression cycle. Shame says ""I'm a bad person"". What you want to work towards is ""I did a bad thing, but I'm working on myself and that's not me anymore"".

I know what I did was monumentally stupid, but I wasn't dealing w/ addiction or anything, so after they raided me I basically decided never to do that again lol, wasn't difficult.  I know a lot of people struggle w/ urges and stuff, which has to suck big time.

I had to tell my mom because I needed her $$ help, but this was also right after I was raided (same day!).  I had to tell an aunt and 3 cousins because I wanted them to write letters to the judge (these were all pre-sentencing).  My aunt and 1 cousin haven't spoken to me since then, though all did write letters.

The PSI guy told my best friends when he called to do his I-ing.  I think the only person I've ever actually really TOLD was my sister.  She's young (19) and it was getting difficult to keep making up excuses as to why I couldn't do a lot of things.  I started by easing her into the reason why I fell into this mess (repressed gayness while growing up) and then kind of sped right by the ""And some of the porn I looked at wasn't exactly...legal""  Luckily she took it very well and didn't care at all.

At least you're past the hard part, all the uncertainty.  Prison itself wasn't that bad, more of a waste of time.  Afterwards is definitely an uphill battle.  Lots of people have trouble finding housing/employment, but lots muddle through just fine.  There's tons of opportunity for happiness.  Just figure out now what may or not be impossible and make your peace with it.  For example, if you wanted to be a school bus driver or something...might be time to think of other options.

Also, if you do get any prison time, don't just waste it.  I've been working on writing a novel this past year, but man i'd be done if I had concentrated on it in prison lol.",2,,2024-11-19 05:00:09,t3_1gub1j7,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gub1j7/new_rso/lxvqj9w/

The denial would most likely be on the probation office ruling and not the jail.  I would recommend contacting the parole district that is responsible for your address/county/city and see if you can speak with someone there.  Not sure how much help it will be, it can be hit or miss.  For me they didn’t really help much before being releases, but you might have better luck.  The probation districts and which areas they’re responsible for are on the VADOC website.

Edit:  Make sure you’re ready for a phone call or a visit from a probation officer to approve or potentially look at the address you’ve submitted.  Sometimes they do and sometimes they don’t.  For me they didn’t contact anyone and just did a map check to ensure it was in compliance with residency restrictions.

I am guessing the PO in the county where your family member was sentenced is the one who needs to submit the address in the system so the local PO where your family member are can receive it and process it.

Need to fight against this in the very beginning. Lobby with your legislator, show up to committee hearings to vote against it, testify. Write to all committee members when it is assigned. 

Get involved to stop it or don't complain when it is passed. 

One legislator at a committee hearing was surprised there was opposition.  "" We have been passing these kind of bills for years."" Because there was no pushback

If it gets out of committee, it is almost impossible to stop it.

You know why many bills have died in committee because there has been a group there to oppose and lobby against them. Stop having other people do the work. Get involved. The number of people who actively who try and stop a bill that adversely affects them and their family are minimal.

To be released from parole, he will have to complete a sex offender therapy program. However, up until recently, CDCR had an illegal policy that required individuals in therapy for the entire length of parole. Law only requires one year. ACSOL sued and got them CDCR to change their policy, but questions are already arising about CDCR qns Therapy providers implementation of it. 

[click here for the resolution ](https://all4consolaws.org/2024/10/ca-new-cdcr-regulations-limit-treatment-requirements-for-parolees/)

However, generally speaking, to answer your question, I have seen individuals discharged from parole after a few years who have lifetime supervision for parole, so it is possible. Basically, your partner needs to fully abide by all the rules, cause no problems, complete therapy, be employed, and/or if he desires go to school.",1,,2024-11-17 19:01:51,t3_1gtcgyg,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gtcgyg/partners_parole/lxmti27/

lxwneup,comment,,"So he’s been out of prison for almost 2 years now and has been attending therapy weekly. He hasn’t had much trouble other than a few very small issues such as issues with his ankle monitor not charging correctly and I think he’s missed therapy maybe twice. Nothing major and nothing they’ve ever detained him over. He communicates well with his PO and they rarely communicate outside of his monthly visits. From what he’s told me, the biggest thing that will stop him from being able to push for an early release is getting violations which he has for the most part avoided. I’m just hoping that he can get released early so we can finally have more freedom to travel and do things outside of his county. My family doesn’t know about his situation and it’s hard always making excuses as to why we can’t attend certain events.

His PO seems like he really mostly just cares about communication ahead of time and then there won’t be any issues. 

Fingers crossed my partner can continue this relationship with his PO and avoid any future violations. I love him and I just want him to not have his world feel so small anymore.

Depending on what their reasoning is to continue, or if he has completed and been released, you can hire a lawyer to go through the administrative process and/or court hearing to terminate parole early.

I believe international human rights laws are essential because they ensure dignity and fair treatment for everyone, including sex offenders. These laws prevent cruel or degrading punishment, protect the right to a fair trial, and focus on rehabilitation instead of purely punitive measures. They also guard against discrimination, giving individuals who have served their sentences a chance to rebuild their lives. By balancing public safety with compassion, these laws promote reintegration and reduce recidivism.

See link below.

[https://valawyersweekly.com/2022/10/16/man-ineligible-for-removal-from-sex-offender-registry/](https://valawyersweekly.com/2022/10/16/man-ineligible-for-removal-from-sex-offender-registry/)

For Tier I offenders, only someone convicted ofa “single” offense“may petition the court no earlier than \[fifteen\]years from...the date of initial registration.” Code §9.1-910(A). The language of the statute isunambiguous and plain.  Although appellant wants this Court to insert a time-passage requirement between convictions, no such language appears in the subsectiondisallowing removalwhen a person has been convicted of “two or more offenses for which registration is required.” See Code §9.1-910(A)(ii).We must presume the absenceof qualifying language was intentional and not an oversight.  See Brown, 284 Va. at 545.  Accordingly, it does notmatter when the repeatoffenses occurred, only that they occurred.  Because appellant was convicted of two Tier I offenses, he was ineligible to petition for removal of his name from the registry, and we affirm the court’s ruling.

According to the manager the only way off is to move out of state or be a pariah until the day you die.\*

Note admins i am not excusing my crime or intentionally victim blaming. I am deeply sadden and wanting others to know VA changed there mind with some of us on the 15 year registry.

lxmcse9,comment,,"  
While I understand the importance of measures designed to protect the community, I respectfully disagree with the approach that the current system takes. If the ultimate concern is truly public safety, wouldn’t it make more sense to adopt a more consistent and effective approach? For instance, if public protection were the priority, those deemed dangerous would face far more restrictive consequences.\*Admin, I am attempting to explain the hiposcracy in the registry as compared to other crimes that others conmmit that are not registered.

In my case, I have successfully completed my sentence and have continued to contribute positively to society. I have maintained steady employment, pay taxes, and even operate my own business. Additionally, I have had all of my civil rights fully restored, including the right to vote, own firearms, and possess federally regulated items under the National Firearms Act. Despite these facts, I am still awaiting approval for my security guard license.

What I find perplexing is that there are many individuals who have committed serious, non-registered offenses and are free to continue living their lives, often without any additional scrutiny. Yet, political leaders frequently focus on offenses like mine, using them to advance agendas that are perceived as being ""tough on crime."" It appears to me that this focus results in political grandstanding rather than addressing real issues of safety.

My intention in raising this point is not to undermine the importance of community welfare but rather to highlight what I see as a hypocrisy in the current system. There seems to be a significant imbalance in how different offenses are treated, and I believe it warrants thoughtful discussion and reassessment.",2,,2024-11-17 17:32:29,t1_lxlrsgj,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gszumk/registry_removal_from_va/lxmcse9/

One time (not sure if I told this story in another post) my PO showed up at my door, demanding to know why I had used the word ""naughty"" on my computer.  I had no clue wtf she was talking about, and when I asked for more info she said it was from a week previously.  Then, she said she didn't know the sentence and that remotecom only flagged that the word was used, so there was no context.

Luckily, she was nuts and only my PO for a few months.  She couldn't handle all the tech that we SOs had access to apparently.  According to my therapist, next PO (who's great), and the polygrapher lol.  The poly guy said that PO wanted a bunch of her people to get extra questions because of similar incidents, but he didn't bother.  He said the normal questions such as ""Have you violated probation"" or ""Have you lied to your PO"" covered any of her concerns, and he wasn't going to waste everyone's time with extra, pointless questions.

Other than keylogging, I'm not sure if it takes rando screenshots or what.  Also this was on a PC so not sure if the phone could do the same thing.  Here in Las Vegas, the POs didn't WANT all the extra work.  They let us have iphones (which remotecom couldn't work on) and would just check our phones randomly.

I remember one time, a PO came to talk to my neighbor in the halfway house.  He wasn't my roommate so there was a \~5' tall wall between us, but I could hear her shock and exasperation ""Wait you got an android?!""

My computer would be randomly taken for a few days to inspect. There were a few visits at work but never inside - always went out to meet them and talk there (per their request).  PO wore civilian clothes for all visits.

lxi71u4,comment,,"They raided me way back in 2010, and was about 1.5 years before I was arrested.  And another \~year or so before sentencing.  Wound up doing 5 years 2012\~2017.

When I asked me lawyers why it was taking so long he said that their computer crime division or whoever, was really backed up and not many people to begin with.  And it's not like it's difficult to catch people downloading CP.  They just get a bunch of IPs and then call the internet company.  Not sure they even NEED a warrant for this stuff to get info from them.

Do you have a lawyer?  I called around right after I was raided.  The first few all charged $200-300/hour, which I sooo couldn't afford, but they gave free consults and recommended other lawyers to try.  After 4-5 I found a group that was willing to work for I think 7k, and would let me do monthly payments as well.

There wasn't much they could do in between the raid and arrest though.  Since I wasn't charged yet there was nothing to fight.  They told me they were trying to keep it in state instead of federal (less chance of jail time and less time also) but for whatever reason, the gov't wasn't doing that.  They also really wanted me to self surrender instead of being arrested, but another no-go.  Their guess was whoever's in charge of those decisions (they knew, I forget) didn't want to seem soft on crime (or SOs in particular maybe).  Would've been much easier for everyone involved if I could've just gotten a ride to the federal building that day lol.

I was super guilty though, so I knew I wasn't getting back my PC or burnt discs.  I DID get back my phone and camera something like 7-8 months later I think, but by then I had gotten a new phone.  Never really used the camera so didn't care about that.  I got a new laptop the same day I was raided as well.  I was in the process of getting a job and needed to communicate w/ the manager via email.

Come to think of it, I don't remember how I even got in touch with anyone that day, without a phone or computer.  I THINK I bought the cheapest phone I could get, with prepaid minutes on it or something, and got in touch with my mom.  I was in college and definitely couldn't afford a lawyer on my own.  Otherwise I wouldn't have told her anything until after my arrest...or possibly after taking my plea deal lol.  She's a super worrier and stresses out about everything already.  Even being 5 min late for unimportant stuff.  So I didn't want to add to that unless necessary.

But I'd highly recommend shopping around for a lawyer immediately if you haven't already.  They don't have to pester the gov't every day ""Where's his stuff?!?!"" but they can maybe get a more accurate answer on the time frame.  Or if there's a particular device you need, they might be able to get through that first.

Like, when they raided me, they wanted to take my PS3 too, but I said ""Whoaaaaah there's nothing on there, I can show you real quick, won't even take a minute"" and they booted it up and saw I had like...one movie on there, no photos.  So they let me keep it.",10,,2024-11-16 22:43:08,t3_1gsl6u3,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gsl6u3/how_long_did_it_take_from_knockraid_to_charges/lxi71u4/

lxjpq8u,comment,,"I really hope that's true! An old friend of mine recently got arrested because someone hacked his phone. They took his phone (only his phone) over a year ago claiming he was perpetrating a scheme that sent random enticements to schoolgirls all over the country, and just now decided to press charges even though he's an old guy who doesn't even know how to send picture messages or what an IP address is. There supposedly was hidden partitions or something using hacked apps to bounce messages off of other numbers sending pornographic pictures to underage girls by automated messaging. 
When they came and took the phone they said they would check it and give it back. They kept the phone and wouldn't respond to any inquiries about it, and never told his wife about there being any warrant, but just this month they arrested him during a traffic stop and said he had been wanted on a locked warrant since July. 
None of it makes any sense, but I'm hoping it's part of some plot to catch the guy who actually hacked his phone. Unfortunately, he almost died in jail because he can't even eat solid food, is on a dozen medications, and has massive health issues. ...not to mention that they might lose their house just trying to get bail and pay for a lawyer.

lxd2s3h,comment,,"I can empathize. Although not fully because the victim was a sibling and the offense committed by another sibling. It's been a tragedy as all of us siblings have grown in that some siblings have chosen to forgive and embrace growth and others... maybe its not a lack of forgiving but more of a protection have chosen to keep a solid boundary called distance and no contact. Both are right. I can tell you from mine and others like me and my siblings... time can help heal and change perspective on wounds, and also both for the victim and the offender. Most of those I've met in your age range seem to have between 7 and 15 years (mid 20 to mid 30's) before they commit to a specific path of healing. The only one that's wrong is the one someone pushes you into. You have to let time, growth and maturity and life wisdom direct that path. No one not even your conscience self can determine that path for your heart.",16,,2024-11-16 01:18:48,t3_1gsaxl2,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gsaxl2/child_of_sex_offender_looking_for_support/lxd2s3h/
lxedltu,comment,,"I’m 40 and when I was 11 my father was arrested for hands on offences against my cousins. I was the one they told about the abuse, and I had to tell my mother. She stayed, after asking me, at 11, if we should stay (I said yes).

He never laid a finger on me - in fact he has been an excellent father and grandfather and honestly has done so much to help me in my life that I can honestly say I’d either be dead or I’d have lost my children to social care without his input. BUT I do have trauma from these events in my childhood. I’m glad we stayed and at the time would have said I was unaffected, as I’m autistic and my emotions seem to be on a time delay. In my 30’s I had therapy and finally dealt with things. Then my ex husband was arrested for iioc and I was back to square one, but that’s another issue.

I hope you can get help and support, and I hope that you can reach a point where you have the relationship that you want with him. I’m on this group because I fully believe that a person should not be cast out from society because of the worst thing they have done, because that’s not all they are. But separate from that belief, I also believe that you need to have the relationship with someone that their actions deserve. My father came home from prison and was a humble, kind and giving presence in my life. If yours is a negative presence, it’s absolutely ok to say enough.",14,,2024-11-16 07:04:32,t3_1gsaxl2,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gsaxl2/child_of_sex_offender_looking_for_support/lxedltu/
lxdzazf,comment,,I (28f) have a dad about to face incarceration for a sting operation and will be on the sex registry  afterwards. My mom is staying and in fact fighting for him and supporting him every step of the way. I also have been extremely supportive bc he’s been nothing but an exceptional father to my siblings and I and got caught up in a bad place from his own childhood trauma. But I will say it is very hard to relate to people or even explain this to people since it’s such a taboo and sensitive topic. A lot of my friends don’t understand my support but again it’s my life and my family. It’s super subjective and I get that it is hard to find people who can be supportive of your situation. I’m glad my siblings and I have one another through this or it would’ve been hell. Also in therapy. I quit drinking and started doing more healthy hobbies  like reading and just overall self care.

I was not in the right frame to know what was happening. Abuse and narcissism are such a hard thing to get out from under. That being said, therapy, support groups, and finding your outlet are the best things. All of the suggestions for resources are fantastic.

I have no sympathy for them. They all need to be locked up for life. They can never be fixed. Why isn't anyone saying how these disgusting human beings and what they do is an epidemic? Are children are supposed to be protected even from their own mothers. I have to live every day with what was done to me by a 50 year old pig.

Currently, even if you change your name legally, you are still required to register your new name with the police under both Christopher's Law and the federal SOIRA. All this change does is ensure that, for those who's cases garnered significant media attention, you spend the rest of your life living in fear that a simple Google search is enough to destroy significant aspects of your life. Something we know from studies, destabilizes peoples lives and increases the risk of recidivism.

Similarly, forcing RSOs to register social media identifiers is completely unenforceable. There is no way for the police to enforce this change as they would never be able to know what social media handles a person is using without breaching their Charter rights.

lxaxf7p,comment,,"I have no criminal record whatsoever, have TSA precheck, and have Global Entry, Nexus, and Sentri. I am an average sized white female, I have no tattoos or piercings, I avoid wearing jewelry or anything with metal, and am always dressed in business casual clothing when flying (only mentioning these things to emphasize there’s no basis for profiling) and I still get regular pat downs. I even got them when I held FAA clearance licenses.

TSA doesn’t see your record when you fly. Border patrol does, TSA does not. Airport police can pull it up, but it has to be done manually and for a reason. 

I did discover some things I was doing that contributed to my frequent pat-downs and remedying those has greatly lessened them.  

I would often show up for early flights with my hair still damp, the drawer where I kept my bras was right above an a/c vent, I chose clothing with lots of zippers and buttons. I’m a “shower and run out the door for the 5am flight” kind of person. Not drying off well enough before getting dressed was an issue. 

A lot of people get dinged on the scanner if they’re sweaty, have wet hair, wear too much aluminum containing deodorant. People wearing things that are a drastically different temperature from their body (like my icy cold bras that were right above the a/c vent). People who are overweight get dinged more frequently because the body scanners are looking for anything outside of what they’ve deemed is normal for a human body. People with large breasts get dinged more, men with larger *ahem* get dinged more… people who are trans will get dinged almost every time…

Whatever is flagging you has nothing to do with your conviction.",6,,2024-11-15 18:17:29,t3_1gs1wbs,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gs1wbs/airport_security/lxaxf7p/
lxav4rs,comment,,"I’m sorry you’ve experienced that. It’s absolutely valid to feel frustrated and wonder if bias plays a role in such situations. While airport security procedures are supposed to follow standardized protocols, implicit bias (and profiling) can still influence who gets flagged or treated differently. Numerous studies and personal accounts suggest that sex offender profiling happens, in these contexts.

It might help to document your experiences, especially if you notice patterns, and consider filing a formal complaint with the TSA. Bringing attention to such issues can contribute to broader awareness and push for fairer practices.

It was amazing and I learned so much. I gained many tools that helped me with acceptance, healing, and being a better parent & friend. 

Also, not having a phone, meetings And emails what what I needed.

I’m glad I went pre trial because most rehabs won’t accept RSO post due to registration.

If he can, he should go. Most insurances including ACA cover some of it. If you have to pay for it, you can definitely negotiate the price down.

We had a few guys in group over that time who hadn't been sentenced yet.  I think they were mainly there for porn addiction.  If that's what your husband is dealing with, I think it would be ok to do therapy.  Just be 5000% clear that they DO have to report certain things. 

Hopefully you can find a good therapist (mine's great!) and even tell THEM your concerns.  Then they can try to steer clear of him incriminating himself.  Maybe talk about why he fell into porn in general, not specifically CP.  If that's his deal anyway.

I never thought of therapy when I was dealing w/ my case (and never thought to look on reddit!), because I didn't think I needed it.  And while I didn't have addiction, I did find out after prison that I was dealing w/ repression from my school days, gay stuff.  Not sure if that would've necessarily helped me to know that before prison, or if it would've looked good in front of the judge.

When I went in for my rdap interview, they said I needed something serious like DUIs or other actual instances of substance abuse, not just me telling the PSI guy that I did it far too much.  So I was denied, but then a few years later more SOs started getting in and they said they didn't have anything like that in their history.  So not sure why my interview was BS.

My advice is to ask around when you get in and find out how other people's interviews went, specifically the SOs.

lx91f1g,comment,,"Your story exemplifies the need to research your charges before contacting an attorney. It appears you faced a class D felony in WI. The maximum penalty is 15 years in prison and 10 years of extended supervision. 973.01(2)(b)4 and 973.01(2)(d)3. For lifetime supervision, the DA and the judge were required to jump through some legal hoops. Your post doesn't indicate if you negotiated for this sentence or entered a blind plea. 

To determine where you fell in the average for this charge, you will need to look up what other people with the same charge in your county received. Court records are public records. You can likely search those records from the comfort of your home. The attorney of record is listed on the case. 

Even though your case is complete, you may want to research the legal hoops the court and DA were required to jump through for lifetime supervision. You might find some recourse there. Even if you find they did not follow all the rules, be careful about launching a challenge. In many jurisdictions, you might open yourself to be fully resentenced.",3,,2024-11-15 12:03:17,t3_1grmu66,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1grmu66/wi_frustration_what_a_surprise/lx91f1g/

I don't recall all the differences between lifetime registration and lifetime supervision. Generally I think registration is you're kept on the list and have to pay your annual $100 fee, whereas supervision is more like a never-ending existence under extended supervision, i.e. the additional rules you have to follow, more regular checkins with the PO, and so on.

With that, I was able to understand what kind of sentence I was likely to receive and what attorneys were getting better results than most. 

Your lifetime supervision had to be requested by the DA and the judge had to make findings from what I read regarding the laws in WI. 

As far as comparing to other charges, I found that to be unproductive. It didn't tell me anything about what I was facing. Unless you are going to start lobbing the legislature in your state to change the guidelines for your felony, only frustration can come of that. I am not discouraging from lobbing the legislature.

I would encourage not taking a plea deal until you feel confident you have a clear understanding and gauge of the facts though regardless of innocence or guilt.

Your lawyer can absolutely see discovery and everything they plan to use. I’ve seen case experiences on here where people have spoken about how their attorneys have had to go to the police station and view the materials in person with a officer to protects the material from being sent to anyone and the attorney having to describe to the client what they saw since they weren’t able to take it with them

My case personally didn’t have anything to do with material like that however we wanted to use a couple videos of stuff for evidence to help me and I can tell you digital evidence/ verification is confusing to see when delivered through discovery. It’s raw data that is beyond many attorneys experience (mine included and he was very good at what he did but honest about that)

I’m glad you have faith in your husband I mean this as a completely neutral stance but if you have faith in him and he truly feels like this is not guilty then please dont  pleayet and spend the money for the digital expert. 

I took a deal for no prison time and a 10 registry only because if I lost at trial it was a minimum of 15 years in prison and life long registry. My charges were in relation to a sexual interaction I had with my girlfriend of 3 years after the night we broke up. I felt leveraged into taking a plea deal for a crime i didn’t do be because my lawyer said with there being a chance of 15 years minimum and them offering no prison it guaranteed me a life where losing at trial would taking away my adult life. while I do still believe he had my best interest at heart, I have regretted it since almost every day

They seized my PC, phone (this was 2010 so wasn't a smartphone), and a bunch of burnt cd/dvds, and a camera.  I got the phone and camera back \~6 months later but they kept the rest.

I think it's very weird that they won't tell you any of that info, especially your lawyer.  It's also VERY weird that it only took a week for them to come back.  It was almost 1.5 years between them raiding me and them actually arresting me.  I think pretty much everyone else I've ever heard of with computer CP stuff took many months as well.

The plea deal is a very good one but also seems TOO good, unless they only found maybe one picture or something?  Personally, I'd just take it.  If he can do 6 months in prison that'd be much better.  If you can figure out a way to get by in that time I mean, I know it'd be a big thing with a newborn.

The other deal, therapy/registration is a whole other story.  Registration is by far the biggest pain in the ass for most of us.  If the jail time includes NO registration, definitely take that.  Even if you have to move, sell the house, whatever.  Because registration might mean you have to move anyway, he might have to change jobs, and it will add speed bumps to many parts of life.

I did 5 years in a federal low for receipt of CP, and have lifetime registration (though I hope I can get out of that early, somehow).  I'm lucky in that I got an apartment and restaurant jobs without much trouble.  And now I live w/ friends, but that's not typical.  My mom wanted me to move in with her when I got out of prison late 2017, but she lived next door to an elementary school lol.  Plus, that would've driven me nuts living there, but I MIGHT'VE done it to save $$ early on.  I wanted to move in w/ friends but my first PO denied it because they had ""too much technology.""  My first job was chipotle, which was fine, but I wanted to try and earn a little more $$.  Applied to uber/grubhub/etc. but they all denied me because I was on the registry at that point.

It also depends what state you're in, and if this is a state or federal crime.  If he does 6 months in a federal prison, I believe that means he'd be a felon?  Not sure if taking the therapy/registration is the same thing, if that counts for the ""have you ever been convicted of a felony?"" part of job applications.",1,,2024-11-14 21:16:52,t3_1grdb0n,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1grdb0n/ny_here_please_help_i_need_information/lx5grml/

As for registration - Level 1, no designation is 20 years.  Level 2 and Level 3, with or without designation, is life (though - in short - you can request a modification to a lower level after the initial level is assigned).  Level 1 with a designation is also life.  Designations are generally automatic and based on the offense of conviction.

SORA formerly had only a 10 year requirement for Level 1, but the law was amended many years ago and now it is 100% a 20 year requirement.

From research I did, thumbnails are automatically generated and are put into a folder, they are separate from any videos or pictures. So if the original file is deleted the thumbnails remain. Unfortunately we probably have to take this plea deal they are offering as we don't have the money to fight this..which is 10 years SO probation and I guess 20 years on the registry? Which is confusing because I asked our lawyer about this and he stated it's only 10 years?

The only obligation a lawyer has is to make 1 motion either written or orally, and show up once.  However, the defendent is held accountable for thier lawyers and thier own actions.  It falls under ""Due Dillegence"", where as a US citizen you are expected to know ALL laws.  Even though it's a minimum 8 year degree and then specialize, a regular person is expected to know.  The only way to get answers is by going to trial, which will most likely increase the charges.  For me, they reserved the Grand Jury past the 180 day mark and ""reminded"" me constantly that the plea for 7 years ""could"" change to a multi-life sentence.

ly4a269,comment,,"Hi!  Tried to send you a private message, which hopefully you got and I can address your questions there.  For now - generally - the thing I can say with full certainty is that there is no option for 10 years on NY's registry.  The shortest possible duration of registration is 20 years, which would be the case only for a Level 1 with no designation.  

  
To address most of the rest of your questions, I'd first want to know whether this case is being prosecuted in NY  state or federally.  

  
In terms of a plea - I definitely don't know the case well enough to give legal advice, but I can say that registration will be automatic based on the offense of conviction and his level wouldn't be pre-determined by plea deal.  The registration process will be a separate, technically civil, proceeding.  Probation would be his criminal sentence and is far more onerous than SO registration, though certainly a better option than incarceration.  So it's very possible that the offer is to 10 years SO probation plus sex offender registration, which again is separate and a 20 year minimum.  Registration requirements are totally unlike probation and, as a Level 1, basically require mail-in verification of address, etc. and a photo in person every few years.

  
I have never heard of anything called safeguard and have no idea what that could be referencing, but if you're outside of NYC that could be why.

  
As for treatment - it is always beneficial to begin as soon as possible as, at the very least, that will be a helpful fact for the SORA hearing.

  
To be able to say anything about housing restrictions, would need to know if the case is federal or not.",1,,2024-11-20 16:17:29,t1_lxy1hps,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1grdb0n/ny_here_please_help_i_need_information/ly4a269/
ly4imhm,comment,,"I didn't get a message from you I think there's something wrong with my account, I tried to private message you as well but it says you don't allow them...but I appreciate you giving information, it means so much. It is a state case, not federal, we are on long island. It states there are no restrictions for tier 1 with no designation but there's different information on every single site so I don't know where to get the proper information. 


So since SORA is going to be separate from the probation sentencing, do we need another lawyer to handle that? 


The safeguard program that was mentioned by our lawyer, I have tried to find any information on it and I can't, I don't know what it is. According to our lawyer it's a serious of tests or something that he would have to pass to be approved to live with and even see our daughter. 


I just don't understand any of this and we aren't getting any clear answers from our lawyer. He has lied multiple times and gotten very rude. He won't even let us speak half the time he cuts us off and says he's too busy... basically they are claiming there are 10 thumbnails on his computer that contain CSAM. My fiance swears that if he ever saw anything of that nature that it was deleted. Our lawyer said that is understandable as he gets tons of cases where this happens. The evidence they claim to have isn't videos or pictures, it's thumbnails which are automatically created when a video or picture is downloaded and stored in a hidden folder on the device. He was using a BitTorrent software to download movies and I think one of the files he downloaded contained some of this horrible material. The problem is on that software the things you download aren't always labeled, the file they said he downloaded was literally a bunch of numbers, he wasn't searching for this crap. So we want to fight it but we just don't have the funds. We've been exhausted of all options for money after posting his bail and paying the retainer for this shitty lawyer. Even then it's a risk to go to trial because a jury is going to hear the word CP and immediately want him behind bars. And then with the probation and registration...I just fear for the well being of our daughter. He is her whole world, they are best friends and not being able to live together, to take her to a park or a zoo...I don't know if I can handle that.

It was one sexual encounter where we changed positions so they charged me a count for each time we changed position (4) because it made it a 15 years prison sentence minimum if I was found guilty and a lifetime registry so when they offered me a deal with no prison time and a 10 year registry it felt like a no brainer to accept.

He was allowed to visit his dad as much as we could and talk to him as often as he wanted until he was released from prison.  Hubby was sentenced in Florida on a federal charge and did his time in Kentucky.  Once released he had to get the judges permission and PO’s permission.    If his paperwork says he can have contact with the kids then I would take that with you.  You can also have your son ask his counselor if they will be permitted .  You may need to visit without them the very first time you go and then take them the next time.

I served X time in prison/probation/whatever.

Don’t make a single excuse, own it and explain what you’re doing to ensure you never do that again.

lx1liu4,comment,,"What kind of job was this?  I did 5 years for receipt of CP, been out since late 2017.  The first job I got was at a chipotle.  I had been leaving that ""have you ever been convicted of a felony"" blank, but after a month or so of no luck, I put in something like ""Spent last 5 years in prison working in the kitchens.  They wound up hiring me over the other \~5-6 people that showed up to interview.  Of course, I lied and told them I had done time for copyright infringement.  Copying videogames and movies.  None of them ever looked further I guess.  Googling my name will pop up the search warrant, but it's vague.  Just says they took some electronic devices and cds/dvds.  Doesn't say what they were looking for.

After chipotle,. I worked in a few restaurants.  I just left the felony question blank and they never asked further questions.  And since I had almost a year at chipotle, that was work history enough for them.  If they asked about what I did before that I just said I worked jobs unrelated to food service so I didn't bother putting them down.  Tech support for iphone, newspaper stuff, etc.  I just didn't specify that all that stuff was like 7 years before heh.

In my experience they don't really do background checks in food service.  Maybe if it's a gigantic company or a casino or something.  I started hosting, but then moved to bussing to make better $$.  I'm in Las Vegas so a good bussing job pays 20-30/hour depending on the shift, I was doing pretty well.  Min wage is like $11-12 here.

I would say look around restaurants and stuff.  I had fun bussing usually.  Could be hard work but it was a nice mix of interacting w/ people and just doing mindless work.  Of course that depends on the restaurant, but I'd still recommend it.  And it's usually very easy to move around/up.  I could've gone to server but I didn't like how my last job treated their servers.  I WANTED to move to barback, but the GM totally screwed me out of the spot, so I quit.",0,,2024-11-14 05:23:40,t3_1gqqdc2,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gqqdc2/need_advise/lx1liu4/

But you’ll find a job who will already know and you can have some form of comfort in knowing you’re not hiding anything and constantly as risk of losing your job. 

Tell them what you did, very briefly, “I was convicted of ______” - that’s it. No detail. The second you say something that sounds like minimizing you’re not getting hired at most places. So, only say that and focus on what you’ve done to get better and what you’re continuing to do to get better. Tell the truth but focus on who you are now and who you want to be tomorrow. 

Don’t let the rejections get to you. They’ll happen. Sometimes because of the company policies or insurance, sometimes because of judgement, sometimes because there are 100 other applicants, sometimes because you’re not the right fit. Keep going. 

We had one guy come through whose crime was particularly heinous. He served 25 years for it. He went through almost 20 rejections but he got a job. He actually likes the job and, 4 years later, is still there.

But it’s something he has to attend. Reading a couple books is irrelevant. Also, if there are way for him to show real remorse (as long as he’s honest about it and himself) then depending where you are (and the full nature of his crime) there might be some leniency as well. Maybe. Get himself to a real therapist or better yet a psychiatrist who specializes in sex criminals. If he tries to do right, and if he can get a good support system in place, maybe the courts will look into helping him. I’m not saying any of this for him to try and con the judge.  I’m saying, if he’s in a position to get himself real help, then not only will he better understand himself and work to be a better man, and is genuinely remorseful, then maybe the judge will at least send him somewhere to continue his treatments or take other considerations when passing judgement.

lwws6u8,comment,,"For sentencing, I would definitely recommend having charecter reference letters from those around you that support you as well have those people attend your sentencing if allowed.

I spent my year on pretrial getting my affairs in order and spending time with family. I went into sentencing under the impression I was looking at least nine years on the super low end, so I went in prepared for that. I was shocked when my public defender asked for the minimum of five years and both the prosecution and judge compromised at six years. The judge said my letters and support in the court room played a factor into my downward departure as well as my time spent joining support groups and seeing a therapist who specialized in sexual devinences post arrest.

I did a lot of research going into my sentencing and knew I wanted to request placement at a SOMP yard for two reasons, one for my safety and two for treatment options. The judge said he didn't have the authority to assign me to a facility but did out it into my paperwork his recommendation for placement. I was very fortunate that I was allowed to self surrender at my facility, so I didn't have to go through the whole transfer process in getting from holding to my destination, so I don't have any info to offer in that regard.

My first month in was really rough honestly. I went in during COVID, so we had mandatory quarantine for 21 days in which we were locked in a cell with one other person and only allowed out once every 48 hours to shower and make a phone call. To make matters worse, one of the medications I took they took me off of because it is classified as a controlled substance but they didn't offer me an alternative so I had to cope with my anxiety without my medication.

Once I got out of quarantine and onto the yard, I was able to meet people and start making friends and get into a daily routine. Don't get me wrong, I had a really hard time adjusting initially and was dealing with a lot of personal issues, but having people i could lean on and talk to helped a lot. I also went to medical early on to address my medication issue and work with them to get me on something new. It took some time to find the right new drug cocktail for myself but once that happened I was a lot more functional day to day and really started to open myself up to trying to new things and meeting more people.

lwwozw6,comment,,"There is definitely a large gay population at Seagoville, not sure if that is intentional or just how it worked out. I would say a large majority of my friends were gay in my time there and the majority are very reapectful when it comes to your own sexual preferences. Most if the hanky panky was kept behind doors but out on the rec yard you would see pda pretty frequently and the beach volleyball area was nicknamed ""Peter Beach"" lol. 

SO's were the majority on the yard, I think at the time of my leaving they said we were roughly 70% of the population. I'm not sure how accurate that is due to a lot of people aren't forward with their charges and unless you were trying to run with a ""solid"" car, paperwork wasn't ever checked.

Although we were the majority, I wouldn't say we ran the yard. From my experience, SOs have trouble banding together and sticking up for themselves. That being said we generally were allowed to do whatever we wanted without fear of retaliation. Every housing unit we had our own TV sections and our own TVs. We freely walked the yard and every work detail had SOs in it, including trustfund.

All in all, I had a good time? Or at least as good as could be expected of being in prison. It definitely wasn't what I pictured going into the system and I was pleasantly surprised at our friendly majority of people were.

lx0giob,comment,,"So most SOs who have drugs in their PSI qualify. I know there are a handful of crimes that don't qualify but I couldn't tell you specifically since it didn't apply to me. For reference I have a possession and receipt and I qualified for the year off. They tried to tell when I applied that I may not qualify, but once my paperwork went off to region for approval, it came back that I qualified. I've heard this is common and I made sure to tell other SOs to apply and find out for themselves, don't take their word for it. 

I'll be honest, my time at halfway house was miserable. I will say this isn't the case for everyone but the one I was at treated SOs like they couldn't be trusted to do anything. I have friends in other states who didn't have the same problems as me in halfway house and they had the same crime. 

At Tampa RRC run by GEO, we weren't allowed to use the computer lab to look for work even though the computers were monitored and a staff member was in there with us. We weren't allowed to have normal smartphones, you could either get a flip phone or a GABB phone, which is designed for kids. So it has no internet browser or any apps needed for functioning as an adult, such as job searching and banking. The staff didn't understand technology at all so they hyper restricted us as a result. I pretty much just stayed in bed and slept through my time there.i wasn't from the immediate area, so I couldn't go to home confinement to finish out my hakcway house time. We had to wear GPS monitors in order to leave the facility to do anything. They also didn't understand SO laws, some of the things I heard while there include: we aren't allowed to drive cars, we can't go to any business that is near a place where child may be, we are never allowed to use the internet again and we can't ever be around children again. Obviously everyone's restrictions are different but rather than figure it out, they just make things up and pretend it's law. 

Were you also wondering about my time in the fed facility or just halfway house specifically?",1,,2024-11-14 00:55:53,t1_lx0bqqv,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gq3w2j/recently_released_from_fed_prisonhalfway_house/lx0giob/
lwv9j1y,comment,,"I'll be honest, my time in the feds was not bad at all. Seagoville is a SOMP yard as well as a PC yard, so most people there are not trying to cause any problems because they don't want to get shipped. There were also a lot of locals and immigrants there but again, they don't want to be sent further away.

Starting out was rough, as to be expected. It's an overwhelming experience to go into prison. I was directed to the other people in my housing unit with similar charges and from there they pointed me to people who shared my general interest in gaming. I joined some gaming groups to play tabletop games which helped a lot.

One of the biggest pieces of advice I can give from my time is to find someone who has been there a while to teach you the ropes/rules. Respect all those around you, even if they don't always show it back. Helps eliminate a lot of potential issues. I personally stayed away from the TV sections because it typically comes with a lot of drama and I preferred to spend my time outside.

I took advantage of the programming offered at my facility. I took RDAP, N-RDAP and SOTP while I was there to help better myself mentally to prepare for release. I worked when I wasn't programming and joined sports leagues and hobbycraft programs to learn new things in my downtime.

I was friends with people with all different charges and different cars. If you are sociable, it helps a lot to meet people and become friends. Friends mean a lot in my experience. The handful of times I did get into a ""disagreement"" with someone, my friends were there to back me up which almost immediately resolves the issue. People tend to not want to mess with someone who is backed from people in multiple cars.

I found sports were the best way to meet people. Even if you aren't good, in my experience people are just happy to have others to play with. I played handball, softball, racquetball, ultimate Frisbee and pickleball primarily. It depends on your facility on what they offer. If sports aren't your thing, finding a workout group can be really beneficial as well.

Stay away from the cops, there's no reason to be friends with them and it only brings negative attention to you. Some of them are good people but in that environment you just have to be hyper aware of how others perceive you and your actions. The less you do to bring attention to yourself, the better.

I met some great people while I was down. I stayed away from people who weren't interested in changing their behaviors or were still ""doing dirt"". If you are legitimately trying to better yourself, surrounding yourself with others that are doing the same is the best. If you hangout with those who are still doing what got them in there, you aren't going to improve your situation when you leave.

I'm sure there is more I can say but this post is already getting really long. If you have any other questions let me know.",4,,2024-11-13 04:22:42,t1_lwv6d61,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gq3w2j/recently_released_from_fed_prisonhalfway_house/lwv9j1y/

lxcq16u,comment,,"I'd say in my experience a large portion of the incoming SOs were younger, early 20s to mid 30s. Though there were a large amount of older ones, majority seemed to have down for a long time or were reoffenders.

The whites exclude SOs from their group and the Tangos, which is the Texas native Latinos, exclude them as well. Only ""clean"" paperwork allowed. As such, their groups are extremely small. Again, this is just on the yard I was on. The blacks, natives, islanders and Mexicans tend to stick together and not exclude people because there's just not enough of them otherwise.

We had a variety of races that ran with the SOs either because their own people didn't want them or they didn't want to deal with the politics within the other races.

Generally speaking, we didn't care what your offense was as an So as long as you weren't still doing the crap that got you in there. There were of course cliques, but it was more on personal interests than anything to do with the type of crime. I will say if you were one of those who was still doing whatever got you there, they tended to be outcast from all the groups and generally only hung out with others like them.

We never really had any issues between cars in my housing unit, but I had heard of a few instances of the SOs in some of the other housing units having to stand up for themselves when others cars were trying to bully them.

Like I said, the yard I was on is a special case. It's designed to house SOs and gang dropouts, so majority people aren't trying to get in trouble because they are terrified of being shipped to another yard. Once you've walked a dirty yard, it doesn't matter how clean your paperwork is once you get transferred.",2,,2024-11-15 23:59:08,t1_lx5cx3h,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gq3w2j/recently_released_from_fed_prisonhalfway_house/lxcq16u/

lwzevgl,comment,,"That's cool.  When I first went in, we were sooooo far at the bottom of the ladder we barely qualified.  We had a very small section in the chow hall, and our yard was pretty big, \~1200 people.  So we were constantly dealing with that.  Trying to stagger people from different dorms, people waiting til last call, trying to rush, etc.  But a lot of times we'd just be full and people would have to stand by the wall and wait, and then the guards would sometimes start making a deal about it, and our reps/shotcallers would meet with the whites (we were a part of their group, ish) and they'd want us to stop circling and we'd be all ""Well then give us more seats!""

The yard was easily half SOs, but the problem was most were undercover.  Out of 1200 our car was only maybe 150-200.  The main reason was the whites didn't want anyone undercover.  Blacks, mexicans, chiefs, all let their SOs run with them.  I know the mexicans extorted theirs, but I don't know if it was a flat ""you pay us $100 a month in commissary"" kind of thing, or if they looked at what you could actually afford.  I only knew 1 guy who was undercover (knew him from the GEO holding facility we were both in at the very start of our time, in the PC pod) and when I asked him a few days in how it was, he just shook his head and said ""You're better off in that car."" 

About 6 months into my time, we had a weird hunger strike of sorts, to protest the new captain's stupid changes.  The capt got pisssssssssssssed and they wound up shipping out like half the yard.  We were definitely down to the low 600s after 4 days.  My guess is they shipped out anyone who had submitted bp8s or were causing issues (after all the reps and shotcallers), because afterwards it was sooooo much more relaxed.

Before, even various subgroups of the mexicans couldn't interact really, other than a few situations like at work.  Couldn't sit together to eat, couldn't use the weight room together, etc.  After, pffffft.  Saw crips and bloods playing dominos, south and northsiders were smuggling food and making pies in the dorm lol.  Got way better for us too.

I got a bit more leeway because a lot of people liked the gays more lol.  It made a lot of people giddy to make their friends super embarrassed by asking me if I thought they were hot, doubly so if I actually did heh.  But when I asked to watch tvs at their areas, there was just a few sec of ""Uhhhhhhhhhh......well....sure why not""

So while I couldn't sit and eat with other groups at mealtimes, it was still pretty laid back.  Especially compared to the first 6 months.",2,,2024-11-13 21:26:17,t1_lwwozw6,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gq3w2j/recently_released_from_fed_prisonhalfway_house/lwzevgl/

In my personal experience, it seems like the receiving districts don't want to take on new people while they are still in custody. That being said, I know a few people who were able to transfer after release from federal custody.

Florida is a forever state, but if you ever plan on coming back to visit for more than 72 hours I believe, you have to register anyways. So if your primary concern for leaving is the registry but you still have family here you will be visiting, it won't be something to get around.

My experience in Florida so far is it depends on which district you're in. Middle district has no mo toeing software, so getting a smart phone and a computer is difficult. Southern district has monitoring software but also has some of the most restrictive living restrictions such as a 2500 ft restriction in Miami-Dade. I'm in the northern district, which has monitoring software available and my county just goes by the states zoning laws which are still a pain but more manageable.",0,,2024-11-13 13:07:08,t1_lwwh7ge,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gq3w2j/recently_released_from_fed_prisonhalfway_house/lwwt1j1/
lwzo2z4,comment,,"Our yard was similar. Really only the whites and the tangos checked paperwork, everyone else just let their races ride together. They just didn't have the numbers otherwise. Thankfully after COVID the chow hall decided no more pick your seat. You sat in the order you came in, so it made eating infinitely easier and quicker.

I played sports with just about ever group and frequently cooked with a bunch of piasas in my housing unit. The yard was really laid back most of the time. Only a handful of gang related incidents in the time was there. Generally the biggest issues were internal car problems which were handled in the bathroom lol.

I watched chip movies at night from time to time but generally I preferred to hangout with friends. I would let anyone use my spot in the TV section regardless of affiliation, a few people in our section didn't like it but I told them we don't exclude, we're better than that and they pretty much left it at that.

Prison is already hard enough as it is for us, being just like the other cars and trying to politic wasn't something I tolerated in our housing unit. We handled our own business and it seemed to make the others respect us more. This was generally true across the compound. The SOs tried to police themselves so people would see we were organized in some capacity.

I had a few gay friends over the years before prison, in prison I would say a large majority of my friends were gay. Honestly I prefer their company to the straights lol.

lx6ob5p,comment,,"It's important to state that when I went into the system, COVID was in full swing. So my first year or so was very different from what you'd go through today.

Because of COVID, I was able to take rdap at the beginning of my bid because they needed people in the program because most facilities weren't transferring inmates and intake had slown down drastically. Generally you take rdap in the last stretch of your bid because they want to send you out into the world with programming fresh under your belt. 

Halfway depends on your release location, bed space available and how much time you are approved for in the halfway house. There are a lot of factors in play regarding halfway house placement. Whether you qualify for first step act credit, how much you've programmed while incarcerated, how long you've been down and of course if your case manager is decent, but the final decision comes from the regional office after they check with the halfway houses in your release area. Also, some halfway houses don't allow SOs, so that can also affect your ability to go to one. 

Each yard is going to differ on the daily routine and how things run. I was at a low security yard so there wasn't a lot of forced structure time. People slept in and stayed up late. There weren't enough jobs on the compound for everyone, so work wasn't required whereas on other yards it's required for everyone unless you have a medical pass. 

Depending on where I was in my bid changed, my daily routine. 

RDAP makes you wake up early, be fully dressed and participate in the program throughout the day. If you don't, you face possible removal from the program. Some yards have really strict rdap programs and others are a little more laid back. 

Once I finished programming I had a pretty laid back routine. I'd wake up for breakfast, work my little job in the unit and then go outside to play sports or attend my D&D games I had scheduled. We are really allowed to do whatever we want within reason. At night I'd hangout in the housing unit with friends, cook some food and ay my tablet. They added institute tablets recently so we can play games, listen to music and rent movies which was a really fantastic addition to the system.",1,,2024-11-15 01:10:16,t1_lx0hi13,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gq3w2j/recently_released_from_fed_prisonhalfway_house/lx6ob5p/

lwt5ob9,comment,,"I served five years of federal supervised release and overall, it wasn't terrible. I was lucky to have had two POs over that time that were professional and reasonable. 

The POs job is to enforce the rules and restrictions that are put on you by the court. If your boyfriend is currently in prison, he should request a copy of his J&C (Judgement and Conditions) from his case manager. The probation conditions that the court put on him will be listed there. It does give the POs a fair amount of leeway in how those conditions are interpreted though. 

Most likely the biggest things will be not being able to be in the direct company of minors without the POs permission... not being able to travel outside of the federal district without permission... and being required to take a polygraph every 6 months. He'll also be required to complete a sex offender treatment program which typically takes around 2 to 3 years to complete and will be required to have monitoring software on any phones or computers. 

They typically will be pretty strict about enforcing the conditions early on until he can prove to them that he can be trusted. After that they may start to lessen the restrictions. The best advice I can give is if there is any doubt whether he can or can't do something, run it by his PO first. And if he has a little screw up, let his PO know about it before he finds out some other way, because he probably will and then it will look like he was trying to hide it from them.",2,,2024-11-12 20:56:50,t3_1gpubt3,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gpubt3/supervised_release_information/lwt5ob9/

Was convicted 11 years ago, got a 3 year sentence. Life time registration and SHOPO 
I was serving military at the time so made all ten national papers.
On release was allowed straight to my parents house with no hostel.
After 6 months living there I moved to a Tiny village about 30 mins away and changed my name.
I spent 2 years not really taking to anyone or leaving the house.
Give myself a kick up the arse, started doing little bits… got a dog to walk and just built confidence.

I met someone and am now married with a young toddler, no social service involvement since before he was born 
About 6 years ago I started a cleaning business that now pulls in 6 figures.

I occasionally bump into people that know my past and most just ignore me,
A builder working in my village who recognised me  let people know who I was, some stopped saying hello, most didn’t care 
The way I look at it, I’ve served my sentence I need to get on with life.
PPU I see once a year, and it’s now coming close to when I can be removed from the register which they have told me they will do 
It’s up to me to get off my arse and get my SHOPO removed.. although the laws maybe changing on that where the police will be able to do it

Thankfully I avoided any news or publicity so I have been recognised that way but it can be a very hard thing to avoid. Depending on the details of your case you could very well be given some community service hours which means you’ll be out on public doing odd jobs. You will see people and people will see you so be prepared for the local community to know you have some sort of conviction. However, my experience has been a good one so far (as good as it can be) the police have been very confidential and although people around me know I have some sort of offence they are respectful enough to leave it be and treat me as any other.

It is a difficult thing to go through. My case was on the front page of the local paper. I got given a 6 month sentence, suspended for 2 years. Was placed on the regsiter for 7 years with a SHPO. 

The court process itself, was difficult as you have the public box open to anyone to come in, from family, local press. I remember when it came to my sentencing, I went blank when the judge asked me to stand. I had to get the police officer to tell me what I got. 

The SHPO was difficult to start with. Closed all of my Social Media, installed software onto my Laptop and Phone, and was on there until the 7 years where over. They used to come round every so often, some times with warning, sometimes without. They wanted to speak to my manager at work. 

I was lucky that the offence and the court took place in a separate place to where I live, so I didn't get much stick, it was mainly from friends that had my number, etc.

 I was convicted 7 years ago. I live in London so hardly anything gets reported on that's not big and there are hundreds of these cases going through every week. No one found out about my conviction except family obviously. My social life wasn't affected, I live with my parents which was fine, there was zero press coverage, so nothing changed.

If you live in a big city, there's more chance the press will ignore it. If you live in a little town where they have nothing better to report on, that's a different story. 

My advice would be upon attending court, when leaving, bring a change off clothes, get changed in the toilet, wear a face covering, hoody etc. I left looking like a bank robber.

The police don't always share your mug shot with the press and I've heard story on reporters attending courts then literally chasing people down the road trying to get a picture.

I've been to a meeting with a good solicitor's firm in Manchester today, and we discussed this same issue. They could only count two or three of their cases where the defendant later received physical attention from people in the community,  and that mirrors what we experience among our clients.

As so many of our clients say, they will expect and prepare of rte worse, but hope for the best. In most cases they don't get reported or any attention. It goes pretty much 'under the radar'.

Kinda sad that in this day in age where we are begging for more therapists, that they are choosing to be picky, especially when these places are supposed to be the foundation for giving people second chances in life.

Update: they also have their CCSS, but were unable to get their CPSW because the state of NM refuses to allow sex offenders into the program (even though the same agency runs both programs).",3,,2024-11-16 11:57:09,t3_1gpg9n0,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gpg9n0/substance_use_counselor/lxf59h1/

In a very broad sense I think they're good as they can catch potential offenders and deal with them without a 'real' victim being involved.

However I'm not sure what should happen once the person is caught. Should they be treated legally as if they did actually meet a minor? If you take away the usual sexual/inappropriate chats prior to the meets then is just the act of meeting a minor illegal if nothing actually happens?

Or should they use it more as an intervention? Get that person into treatment etc.

One thing for sure though is I have no time for the vigilante groups doing this stuff. If it has to be done I'd much rather an official, recognised legal entity carry it out.",8,,2024-11-12 20:52:58,t3_1gp8z0k,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gp8z0k/sting_operations/lwt4z48/

Given the time and personnel costs involved, these stings may not be proportional to the nature of the offenses, diverting resources from more serious community safety concerns.

They don’t seem to list an address but it’s not that hard to find anyones address and they do list your cars. 

Here’s an example of what one school sent out:

Even though I'm not on the registry cuz I'm a tier 1 New Jersey my crime was the first thing that came up. Him and his buddies got together conspired and got me fired. Not because I was in the registration but they all made a claim that I violated one of the policies of the company and they all corroborated each other stories so it was me against three people. I ended up losing a real good job my boss knew and he was really good about it but it's unfortunate. My boss was very upset because he had to push the complaint up the ladder and he was almost crying when he told me I got fired. So keep it to yourself you never know what happens. Silence is golden. The less you say about your situation the better. Assist him stand by him and help him but keep it on a professional level.

Do you have any friends/family that know about any of this?  Now's the time to bug them for $$ if you want to try and get a lawyer.  Only reason I told my mom right after my raid is because I needed her help with $$ lol.  You can also call around and try and find one that'll work for a flat fee instead of hourly.  The first few I called all gave free consultations (5-10 min was all they needed) but charged $200-300/hr and had no idea how many hours it could take.  Definitely couldn't afford that.  Some gave me suggestions on what lawyers to call though, and after 4-5 calls I found a group willing to do it for \~7k, and they'd also let me make monthly payments.    
  
I think they also took 1 payment up front, and then didn't start charging the rest until I was actually arrested.  I think they had to take some $$ so they could be officially my lawyer, but there wasn't much they could do in between the raid and arrest because I hadn't been charged with anything specific yet.  Was a bit over a year in between arrest and my sentencing (6 years for receipt of CP) and at the end they ended up just waiving the last 1k or so I owed them.",1,,2024-11-13 21:15:15,t1_lwurp84,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1goq03n/i_got_court_wednesday/lwzcnr7/

A lot depends on whether this is federal or state charges. I am federal in NY. I was federal, received 5 years supervised release, no jail time. I am in a group with mixed people. One person was convicted of touching (state charge) from a decade ago, received 6 months in prison plus 10 years probation. Other federal possession received probation. One federal possession just received 5 years. Hopefully a lawyer can explain all the mitigating circumstances to the ADA/AUSA and something can be worked out. Federal charges are notorious for having ""mandatory minimums"" when it comes to sentencing. Federal facilities are also known to be better when it comes to facilities. 

To sum up, a lot depends on the state and if it's federal/state charges.

My crime was Pos of CP in Nevada.

I have a long post somewhere here about my whole journey through the state level. Each state is different but definately better sometimes then the Feds.

What I learned in the court ordered therapy is about how to manage the thoughts, to understand what you did wrong. Victim sympathy, and how to get your needs met in a positive way. It definately sounds like he was missing something that wasn't getting fufilled in a positive manner, depression and stress can sometimes trigger the need to fill a void.

The best thing you can do is support him through his case. Write letters to the judge when the time is approprate to show that he still has a supporting family.

lwjqnge,comment,,"Most likely going to do 5+ years, but there's always a chance he can get something different.  A lot depends on the prosecutor, judge, his lawyer, state he's in, etc.  Does he have a lawyer?  A good one?

I did 5 of 6 years for receipt of CP.  It was (obviously) stupid, but I was dealing w/ repressed sexuality stuff from my school days.  Not everyone who gets into CP is addicted to porn, and very very few are outright pedophiles.  If you're comfortable talking to him about it, even if it's not right now, you might better get to the bottom of why he did it.

Obviously you have to think about any future kids you might have first, but there's always the possibility of him being able to be around them under your supervision.  Out at a restaurant or something.  Either way, that's not something you have to decide right now.

As for prison, it really wasn't that bad.  More of a waste of time.  We SOs were definitely the bottom rung of the ladder by FAR, but if you kept your head down and didn't make any colossal blunders, you were fine.  Worst we had to deal with at my place were lockers being broken into a few times.  Most SOs who go to prison for computer CP crimes wind up in federal lows, and the other people there have short sentences and don't want to risk getting more time by causing any real trouble.

I saw maybe 4-5 SOs get jumped, usually in the middle of the night, but it was just a bloody noise/black eye kind of thing.  When they got up out of bed the guys doing it (usually young stupid mexicans) ran off.  But every one of those SOs did something incredibly stupid, and they STILL had options to handle it better, but chose not to tell people or took a ""They can't tell me what to do!"" attitude.  They would've all had to be transferred no matter what, but they could've easily gone to a guard and just said ""Hey, I'm not safe on the yard anymore"" and they'd have been put in special housing (where they also put people for disciplinary problems) until they could get transferred out.

There wasn't too big a distinction between hands on and computer crimes.  I'd hear other groups talking about the hands on people sometimes, like ""That's the sick \_\_\_ that did \_\_\_,"" but it's not like they were inviting me to play soccer or work out with them either.  They'd still work with them and give them quesadillas and stuff if the boss told them to.  They might just not joke around as much I guess.

As far as autism, well, I knew a few guys in prison that I'm fairly positive were autistic, and they seemed to do fine.  Like I said, the important part is just not causing trouble and showing respect.  Well, what the other inmates consider respect anyway, which can be pretty much anything lol.  Sometimes just disagreeing with someone can be a ""You disrespecting me?!"" kind of situation.",4,,2024-11-11 07:24:04,t3_1gokcxq,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gokcxq/my_28f_younger_brother_24m_was_arrested_for/lwjqnge/
lxfgamb,comment,,"I'm sorry this happened to you, but I have to wonder why you said you wouldn't want him around your future children. Most people charged with CP are NOT pedophiles.  You do realize that right?  The last thing he needs is to be rejected and isolated. He should get a psychosexual evaluation to determine if he has a legitimate attraction to minors. Also, parents need to pay more attention to their kids. A vast majority of child sex abuse is perpetrated by someone the child knows and unfortunately that could be a friend, teacher, family member. Find the courage to stand by him. Stand up to the ugly judgemental trolls out there who will attack him and you. I'm doing that for my son and will do so until the day I die

Can I ask why it’ll most likely be 5+ years? Is this a typical sentence? I did some research and found in CA your first charge could be up to 1 year unless it’s 600 images or more, or really graphic CP. I asked him about this he said he definelty wasn’t 600 images/ videos or the other type. 

He did open up about what lead to it. He was abused when he was younger and has always had trouble with sex in general. Then when our mom passed he felt like no one in the family really loved him or cared for him. He felt forgotten about. He said he hated himself and he didn’t care what happened to him.

lwnmgfm,comment,,"Well, state is very different.  With federal charges there are mandatory minimums.  There are also enhancement pts that push those up, but judges have wiggle room there.

The enhancement system is stupid.  It basically starts you at the minimum then adds pts for stuff like using the internet, having more than 5 images, etc.  My pts put me in the 10-12 year range, but my judge was (luckily) not a fan of all that and gave me 6.

I thought he would automatically be assigned a public defender if he didn't have a lawyer, right at arrest.  Did that not happen?  Maybe that's different at state level too?  Didn't think so though, that's kind of a right people have lol.

I had gotten a lawyer right after I was raided, and wasn't arrested til \~1.5 years after.  When the FBI came to arrest me, they wouldn't let me call my lawyer, said I could do it later.  They took me in and did the fingerprinting and all that, and when I asked to call my lawyer they said they'd do it for me.  Not sure if they were stupid or scumbags or what.  A few hours later I was pulled out to meet with a public defender.  I told her that I had lawyers and that I had been trying to get ahold of them all morning.  She asked for their name/number but I didn't have anything other than ""las vegas defense group,"" which was luckily one firm and not a big ol grouping of many.  She was able to delay my appearance in front of the judge a few hours so one of them could get down and be with me in court.

Again, very much not familiar with how state works, but in federal at least, they count videos as multiple images.  Not sure if it's 1 second = 1 image or what, but it's extremely rare for anyone with federal computer crimes to have less than 5 images.  It would have to be the super rare case where someone gets sent one by accident or something.  Most of us were looking for it on our own though.

I don't know what your $$ situation is, but you can try calling around and looking for a lawyer willing to work for a flat fee (retainer I think it's called?).  They do free consultations usually, even if it's just a quick 5 min rundown.  I had to go through 4-5 before I found the ones I hired.  The first few all charged $200-300/hour and couldn't say how many hours that would be.  The last said they'd do it for $6-7k, and let me do 500/month, which was a big help.  Then, after I was sentenced, they waived the last 1k or so also.",1,,2024-11-11 22:34:02,t1_lwlhy9i,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gokcxq/my_28f_younger_brother_24m_was_arrested_for/lwnmgfm/

lwu8znu,comment,,"Hello mate. Uk guy here who has been through all the legal stuff but I am by no means an expert!

Honestly ; I do not think you will be able to travel to America. For my case I went to Magistrates and the Crown (time between was a few months). But at the magistrates although they did not sentence me they did make me report to the sex offenders registry. This meant that I was subject to the rules. I had house visits before I even got sentenced. 

I think (although I am not sure) that once you are subject to the registry it counts against you when going to places that typically bar convicted people. 

And as another commenter has put there are a whole load of details you have to give before they allow you to leave the country. And even with the details the police have the right to refuse you. I think they will refuse you because you might be seen as a flight risk. And even if they did allow you I’m not convinced America would let you in. 

Perhaps you could try going somewhere nearer home like France or Spain? Travel isn’t impossible for us and America could very well be on the table in the coming year/years but I wouldn’t be suprised if they tell you to wait until after sentencing.

It's hard to say what the courts will do with you being an RSO, normally all you would need to do is petition the courts in Nevada and you could stay where you are now. and still get visitation/custody.

lwf9d8c,comment,,"I think my advice here is that this is not likely to help you, and may harm you. For one, you don't control what the reporter could write about, and it may end up being more negative than you would expect. And, it puts a new article about your crime back at the top of search results. In my opinion, everyone that you care about knowing the truth, you can explain it yourself. This article would mostly be seen by people that don't know you, or maybe a prospective employer looking you up. You just have to decide for yourself whether you think it is worth it. My crime had a lot of false and misleading information going around, and I understand the urge to yell out into the void and correct all of the misinformation.

That is real love and you have a lot of support in that alone . Stay busy but rest as well and I don't know if you have court ordered therapy or not but if you do it will suck at first but give it a real chance , mine changed my life .

lw9vw1p,comment,,"I met my partner on Reddit. I made a post in another sub on another account, and he responded, and we started messaging. Neither of us was seeking a relationship, and certainly not expecting to find one on Reddit! By sheer coincidence, we had the same days off that week, and we spent a couple of days messaging back and forth. 

We connected on a number of things. He was adopted from a country that I visited as a young adult. Neither of us was raised by our biological parents. We actually left our first homes and traveled to reluctant caregivers in new geographical locations the very same year! We have similar religious upbringings. We both have military backgrounds. And, of course, our overall values and philosophies are very aligned and compatible. 

We talked every day for about a month. We had planned a visit to meet in person. He told me that there were some things that we had to go over before I purchased my ticket. He told me about his charge, his trial, his plea, everything. I think he talked for an hour and a half straight. I always thought that it must have been so painful and terrifying to have that conversation! 

For me, it felt like my brain was fracturing. All of the rhetoric that's been shoved down my throat from all forms of media coming from all different directions for years, and now I'm faced with a real humanized individual story challenging innumerable strawman arguments I've fallen for. Needless to say, I needed time to process the information and review the documents he sent me. 

Here's where it gets uniquely complicated. I'm polyamorus and have been for more than a decade. I'm married. I'm firm in maintaining my integrity and adhering to the only rule my husband and I have: no secrets and lies. We do not dictate each others relationships. We simply communicate our needs, concerns, and preferences before allowing each other autonomy in the choices that we make for ourselves. Still, this was a circumstance we'd never imagined encountering. I had to disclose this to my husband, and I wasn't sure what I would do if he wasn't supportive of the relationship. 

My husband has a relative who spent years working as a sex crimes detective at the state level. We spoke to him and gained some very helpful perspective. We're rational people and can understand that these crimes are incredibly complicated, as are most people. The majority of perpetrators are not evil and soulless predators beyond redemption. Evidence shows that the majority of perpetrators are victims themselves. The rate of recidivism is rather low and helped greatly by treatment and a good support system. It was also very vindicating to hear this former LEO express his disdain for polygraphs and the registry. 

In the end, as much as my boyfriend expected me to walk away, I didn't. I appreciate that he disclosed, and I appreciate getting to know him as a person first. I think his timing for disclosure was perfect. I've visited him twice now, and I'm counting down to our next visit. I've helped him with research and writing related to his case. I've successfully identified and contacted the correct entity to have an error on his registry entry corrected. 

My husband and I are both offering support. We have plans for my boyfriend to relocate after probation. We'd all like to build our own home in a rural area. Oh, yeah. No, my husband and I don't have kids and don't have any interest in being parents to hoomins, just animals. If our homestead is listed on the registry, we'll just deal with that.",14,,2024-11-09 17:08:12,t3_1gndl3e,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gndl3e/being_the_partner_of_an_rso/lw9vw1p/
lwbb0ae,comment,,"We met before he was ever charged, about ten years ago, through a mutual best friend (who is no longer in our lives because she was not supportive of our relationship/aggressively angry about it  and is also the catalyst for him being on the registry due to being angry he didn’t want to date her, but that’s a whole other story). 

We became close friends about four years after we met, after he was released from jail and had completed his probation, because we were trying to help this same mutual friend navigate an abusive relationship she was in at the time. I knew about his case from this same friend and offered support because I trusted her judgement that he was a good person who made a mistake. 

We hooked up two years ago around Christmas, probably loneliness? We called it trauma boning, and we’ve been together two years this year.  

Neither one of us has kids, he’s on the fence about having kids because of being a lifetime registrant, while I’d be more than happy to navigate that with him but understand his hesitation. 

The only person I’ve lost is the mutual friend we had, but that’s because of her behavior towards us after we told her we were together. It wasn’t because he’s a RSO, but all of a sudden he was lazy, a baby, couldn’t function, needed to grow up, etc. As for me, I apparently was the “same person” as my boyfriend because I kept telling her I didn’t want to hear about her issues with him because our friendships were separate issues, as was my relationship with him. 

I do have a friend (I introduced him to my best friend and they’re together and they’re so cute) who refuses to associate with my boyfriend. I can’t even mention my boyfriend in his presence. It’s disheartening, but I respect his boundaries. 

I genuinely love my boyfriend to the moon and back. He’s an absolute dork, and I wish we’d been closer when everything was coming to a head legally for him because I could have helped steer him in the correct direction. He made one mistake and is aware of it, and has kept to himself and trying to build his life back up. I’m happy to support him in the process because he’s a gentle soul and is always striving to better himself.  

I also absolutely want to steal his truck but that’s neither here nor there.",5,,2024-11-09 21:43:55,t3_1gndl3e,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gndl3e/being_the_partner_of_an_rso/lwbb0ae/

My nieces ages 17-19, recently looked him up on line only to discover his past.  They were very angry with me and felt I was hiding something.  When would have been a good time to tell them, and why do they need to know?  His crime was before any of them were born and was not against a minor.  As we approach Thanksgiving, I am not sure how things will go as I have not spoken with all of them about this yet.  Neither my bf nor I have kids.  My guy had a stroke in 2007 and lost his speech which adds to the complication and probably helps him because people feel bad.  

The one who introduced told me on our 1st date as we were driving to a show that I payed for, that he had been arrested and was going through court proceedings.  Was that the 'right' time?

lx4d6z0,comment,,"Hi! I met my partner originally while he was working. Lol. I needed an oil change and went up the nearest one with the best reviews. I had just gotten out of a relationship and was pretty depressed. I work from home, so that oil change was probably the first time I had been outside in a week 😬

 Anyways, we met, I remember thinking he was adorable and we actually had a conversation (I don't remember specifics now, just that it was in regards to me being originally from a different state). I left there thinking I'd never see him again. 

Fast forward 6 weeks or so, and I was on a dating app. I had just made a profile and was already frustrated with people on it, so I was about to delete it. Plus, I was strongly thinking of moving back to my hometown.  Then, he popped up! At first, I didn't recognize him, but swiping through his pictures, I realized - that's the guy from the shop!! So I matched with him and immediately asked him (hopefully not creepily) if he worked at this one place, and it was confirmed he did. He claims he remembers me, but after a month of all these customers,  I doubt it. Ha. 

We spoke that day, and he asked for my number and picked me up for our first date two days later. He disclosed everything on the first date. Our date lasted like 7 or 8 hours ! It was incredible,  I was not judgemental at all, and I just asked questions as I wanted to better understand the situation that led him to be on the registry. 

He met my family last Christmas (2023). Before he met them, I did talk to all my family members about his past. Everyone was so understanding as well. I was especially nervous for one family member who has young children.  But they said if I trust him, they have no issue with it. 

We got engaged last month, and we have been together 1.5 years now. I have only told one friend, and they were understanding as well. It's kind of on a need-to-know basis at this point. I'm not embarrassed about him, but I know the stigma and harsh judgment that may come with it. Plus, all my friends and family live out of state, so none of my friends have actually met him sadly. One day!!🩷

Oh, and I don't have any children. We want them together, and now that it's been a decade since he's been on the registry, I'm researching how to help him get off it b/c it's so restrictive and definitely impacts our relationship.

lwm0tzh,comment,,"Exactly!

Volunteering in reentry I can assure anyone who thinks that for half a second that it isn’t true. 

“But Murderers aren’t ….. don’t…. We have it worse….” 

Yeah, no, most of them never leave prison. If they do, they’re often on monitoring for life or for many years. 

According to BOP and DOJ stats the average time served for murder is 38.5 years. And that doesn’t mean they were released, most of them died there. 

It’s rare that they leave prison that there aren’t blanket laws (like RSO’s have) but, if they do, the recidivism rate is like 0.4%. 

I volunteer for the innocence project occasionally (doing one very specific thing, so it’s not often but it’s in depth). There are so many people WHO HAVE BEEN EXONERATED or had their cases overturned that have had to wear ankle monitors and follow curfews for a year or more while they waited to see if the county decided to re-file the charges.  

You think it’s hard to find a job for a RSO? Try finding one for someone convicted of murder. They come out at 65+ years old usually. And they’ve spent most their lives incarcerated so they can’t get social security, they can’t get most federal or local assistance with housing or food. 

The ones who had kids who are now adults that still have a relationship with them are the lucky ones.  Because their parents are usually dead by the time they’re released, they’re lucky if they have a sibling who cares enough to help them. They can’t rent anything. Manual labor jobs are all that’s available and they’re almost always too old to do that kind of work. They can’t usually get in to a nursing home, they often have a curfew, they often can’t leave the state, most cannot get a passport at all. 

Not enough are released to bother to make the same laws that cover RSO’s and almost all of them have lifetime parole or probation when they are released. 

It’s a dumb comparison.",3,,2024-11-11 17:39:44,t1_lwlqpv3,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gnayub/getting_denied_gym_membership/lwm0tzh/

lwat6fw,comment,,"Like other people here, I think that sounds more like a PSI.  Was it kind of like giving your life story?  That's what mine was like, took maybe 2-3 hours and was right after I was arrested.  As in, they took me to a cell at the federal building after arresting me, then brought me out to talk to the PSI guy, brought me out again to meet with the public defender, and told HER that I have a lawyer that the FBI hadn't been able to get ahold of.  She was able to facilitate that luckily.  That afternoon I was in front of a judge.

Don't know if what I had after prison was a ""psychosexual evaluation,"" but after prison I had to do a sexual history polygraph.  That was a few hours and pretty embarrassing.  They asked me a ton of questions about if I've ever X or Y.  Didn't have to pay though.

You’re not getting 10 years, they’re full up, they’ve got no space for you. If you do go down I’d say it’s probably going to be less than a year.

You need to speak to Stop it now and go on the inform plus course - it’s £800 but it’s worth it. Stopso is also a good move - get yourself into therapy. And most importantly for you by the sound of it - contact sex addicts anonymous. You need help.

My ex didn’t lose anyone. Every personal relationship is intact (I didn’t split with him because of his offence but because of other issues). His parents, his friends, my parents, me - we all stood by him. Sometimes people stay. In fact I lost more people than he did!

lw69spi,comment,,"Sounds like you haven't actually told your friends and family.  There's definitely a chance many will have the reaction you dread, but you never know.

I was raided for CP back in \~2010, then arrested about 1.5 years after that.  Not sure if they do the same in UK, but here in USA they have someone do a pre-sentence...investigation?  PSI.  He talked to me for 2-3 hours, basically got my life story.  Then he wanted some phone #s he could call as a character reference.  I only knew a few off the top of my head.  My aunt, my best friends, and uhhh I forget the 3rd, another aunt maybe.

My uncle picked up and thought it was a prank, hung up, my other aunt never picked up.  But one of my best friends (brothers) picked up and they talked at length. When the PSI guy asked if I had anger issues my friend laaaaaaaughed and laughed, because I'm so laid back people think I smoke weed (never touched the stuff).  The prosecutor wanted no bail, but PSI guy said I was no threat and would be fine w/ what my lawyer wanted, house arrest.

I wound up telling them everything, and they never batted an eye or cared at all.  I didn't tell their parents because they're old heh.  I wound up living w/ them for the last year or so of my house arrest.  And when I went in to prison (5 years for receipt), they came to visit me frequently.  The parents found out the truth about halfway through, and they also didn't care.

When my lawyer asked me to get friends/family to submit letters to the judge, I got in touch with the aunt and her 3 daughters, all older than me.  One aunt and one cousin haven't spoken to me since then.  Another cousin texts me maybe once a year to see how I'm doing, and the other has been more receptive.  Even wanted me to stop by and see her family a few years ago when I was in town.  But I was there for a funeral and wasn't really feeling up to it, plus I didn't want to bring it up to my PO.  I think he would've been fine with it now though, since my cousin knew my whole story.

But anyway, my point is I've had people that knew me my whole life, who I've lived with at times, that cut all ties and never want to speak to me again.  It hurt, moreso at the time, but over time it's gotten better.  And never know, they might one day decide they've been stupid and want to reconnect.  I'm not going to try and force it or anything.  When i was back in CA for the funeral I drove by my aunt's place where I lived for 2 years (nonconsecutive) of high school a few times.  Wasn't even sure if she still lived there though.

You're still very young though, so even if, worse case scenario, everyone you know doesn't want to talk to you, you can make new friends.  If you do time, you'll still have plenty of years with which to live your life.  When I got out I was \~35 and it was pretty embarrassing to be working at chipotle, or as a host/busser later on.  I look pretty young though (people thought I was early 20s) but eventually it would come out.  People were always shocked because I didn't look old at all, but then there was always a ""Wait why are you bussing at 38?"" and I'd just say I've had other jobs and am just trying to make some $$ while I figure stuff out.  That seemed to satisfy their curiosity luckily.",5,,2024-11-09 00:34:11,t3_1gms163,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gms163/my_life_is_over/lw69spi/

Contact your GP, and talk to them, ask out NHS talking therapy, because you will go through all kind of emotions and get depressed and down, as I think you are now. 

If this is your first offence, and depending on the severity of IIOC and the amount, you may well get minimum sentencing guidance of community order. It's extremely rare to get 10 years for possession unless you actually made them, and there are agrivating circumstances involved in it.

You are now on par to a homeless man social status if not less \^\_\^.  
Society will never ask why you or anyone else had a porn addiction at 12yr old... instead they'll just say you should have known better you horrid monster... atleast till their kid falls into this trap and then go ""my god how did this happen"". 

Good news is, you can still live a life... You can sorta start over. But in this digital age thats a false statement even without the charge.   
No matter where you go unless they lack internet and restrictions youll be fallowed tracked and reminded of your mistakes.   
  
You'll need to aim to get a barely livable wage if your lucky... and try your damnest to come up with some type of work around or hit the lucky 7's of someone giving you a chance.  
Partner wise if they don't mind the broken prospect of prosperity you can offer if not the debuff altogether. I can only wish you luck. prepare to be primary single and learn to love thy self.   
  
You'll have secret anxiety all the time now, and you'll likely feel like you have no friends because in a way you have to keep people at a distance or you risk them making your life hell if they find out your a SO. (With the rare expectation)

Honestly, my advice is to get a dog, get a small flat that you can afford, and hold tight your finances because you'll never know when you have to find a new job.  
Try to enjoy the small things and also this might help in a way. You'll notice there will be plenty of people who are worse off than even you with no charges (it funny in a ironic sense).",1,,2024-11-13 05:07:25,t3_1gms163,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gms163/my_life_is_over/lwvffoe/

lw56hyt,comment,,"You'll likely have a lot of restrictions put on you during probation. A lot of this depends on the PO that you get. Some will be reasonable, and some will try and make things difficult.  But two years will go by pretty fast.

Probably the worst thing about being on the registry is that it makes it difficult to find a decent place to live and a good job. It sounds like you might have the job thing covered, so that's great.

Most cities in Texas have residency restrictions ranging from 1,000 to 2,000 feet, but Houston doesn't have them as long as you're off probation. I'm pretty sure there is a 500 foot restriction for anyone on probation in Texas if the city doesn't already have them.

You'll need permission to travel during probation. Usually anything outside the county. Once off probation you'll need to be aware of the registration laws for sex offenders visiting another state. They can range from within 48 hours to up to 14 days in some instances. And be very careful, because if you visit some states (Florida is one) they will put you on their registry for life. So even if you're off the registry in Texas you'll still show up on theirs during a background check.

Overall, you should feel lucky that you only have to be on the registry in Texas for 10 years. The majority of sex offenders there are on it for life.",3,,2024-11-08 20:58:13,t3_1gmrui5,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gmrui5/about_to_take_a_plea_deal_soon_houstontexasjust/lw56hyt/
lw57msi,comment,,"A lot depends on if you're tier 1 or tier 2.  Do you know what tier you'll be?  Also what state?

I did 5 years in a fed low for receipt of CP, came out in late 2017 and was assigned tier 1.  That means I wasn't able to be looked up by random schlobs, and didn't show up on background checks.  Police and other gov't types could but that was it.  

Luckily, I got a job (chipotle) and apartment before the laws changed a year or 2 later.  Then, most people in NV (vegas) got bumped up.  Hundreds/thousands that weren't even on the tier system became t1 and had to do yearly registration, practically all the t1s like me got moved to t2.

On t2, I have to register 2/year, show up on background checks, etc.  I tried to get a job doing uber/grubhub and the like but was rejected from all because I showed up on the SO registry.  I didn't NEED it, just wanted some extra $$ on my own time.

Having friends/family to support you is much more important.  I wasn't able to fully live on my own working at chipotle, even with the cheap (but good) apartment I found.  Still needed $$-help from my mom to help w/ car insurance, and I had EBT for help with food.  My second job at a restaurant was better, but I was still just barely able to be on my own.  It helps that I'm very happy without a lot of stuff lol.  I don't drink or smoke or party, just play videogames and hang out w/ friends and family for the most part.

I haven't tried to travel much.  Went to CA (state line) once to get a lotto ticket, and again to CA for a friend's funeral, my PO had no issues with that.  I did ask to go to a videogame convention once and my PO said no because he thought it wasn't a good idea because there would be minors around.  I even looked up a bunch of info and showed him that the majority of attendees was like 25-40.

My first PO wasn't great, and was a particular jackass the first 6 months or so.  I forget exactly what happened but I emailed his boss asking for a new PO because he had lied to me.  Or mostly lied anyway.  I think I requested...something and he said no it wasn't allowed, but then later on when I asked for clarification it was more of a ""Well...it's not teeeeeechnically against the rules, but I didn't think it was a good idea.""

He would come in and search my whole apartment and check behind doors and stuff at first too.  After 6-12 months though I guess he realized I wasn't going to be an issue, and dialed it back a ton.  His monthly visits were like 20 sec after that.

I had another PO for a few months but she kept freaking out at how much technological freedom we SOs had, and wound up quitting/transferring.  I've had a different PO for a couple years and she's been awesome.  OH I think I know why I tried to switch POs.  I requested to move in w/ my 2 best friends and their parents (I had lived w/ them before prison too).  My PO checked it out and said no because there was ""too much technology"" there.  And then months later after I moved into an apartment, he said that tech wasn't against the rules.  Yeah that was it.  My current PO approved me moving in w/ the same friends as long as they had PW on their computers.  When I told her about my first PO denying it she laughed and said that was stupid.

So yeah, POs are just people.  Might get a bad one, might get a great one.  Best bet is to keep your head down and not make waves.  You can protest and question, but don't be belligerent or hostile.  Treat them like a boss for a job you REALLY need.",1,,2024-11-08 21:03:55,t3_1gmrui5,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gmrui5/about_to_take_a_plea_deal_soon_houstontexasjust/lw57msi/

lwfwtup,comment,,"Wife of an RSO, here. Met six years post-release. Got together outside of work for ice cream as friends then he asked me on a “regular” date. After dinner on that first date, we walked along the riverfront boardwalk and he told me about his status and his crime. He expected there was a slim chance that I would want to continue dating him, so he asked me to consider friendship because he hadn’t been treated like a human being in a very long time and found great joy just talking with each other. 
At the time his offense occurred, he was a vet suffering from severe depression, PTSD and alcoholism upon returning from a brutal deployment. He became a chain smoker after never having smoked before. He had started using porn while as a coping mechanism because carrying around corpses and getting shelled every day for a year can be devastating psychologically. At the time this happened he was career military special forces, a respected leader in the community, a college scholarship donor among many other things, with a wife and six kids. He was an amazing man with amazing family, friends and colleagues that got too drunk and did something horribly stupid. He turned himself in and admitted his crime willingly.

I talked to the necessary people to confirm all this and when I realized he was being truthful in everything, I had no hesitation saying yes to dating him. I didn’t reject him for his lowest moment, I accepted him for his honesty and courage and kindness. We married in 2022. 

Life is not easy at all, and I have lost family because of my choice just as he lost some of his, but I have no regrets. We are working hard to build something good together - right now we are waiting for permission for him to transfer states as we have a home where I am and he is living in his truck in the state where the offense occurred because the laws are so severe finding a home or job is nearly impossible. 

Despite the difficulty, neither of us feel it is hopeless. We have both determined in our hearts that we will continue to pursue every avenue that gives us a peaceful and simple future together. I had lived through a lot of very difficult circumstances prior to meeting my husband, so we both came into this situation with resilient and determined spirits. He is worth every struggle to me, I just have to remind him to believe that about himself, sometimes. 

Time makes everything easier as we learn to adapt and overcome. One day the registry will feel more like a mild inconvenience and you will find people to share the struggle with that are truly in your corner. We have a small circle of friends now and when he has a travel pass, we enjoy dinners together, board games, movie nights. We have even been on a well-planned vacation. Life is still beautiful. We have learned how to enjoy things within the boundaries of the registry and have chosen to seek out what we can do versus what we can’t.

I know with a great attitude and determination, anything can be overcome. Be encouraged and keep persevering! We are rooting for you and you are not alone.",5,,2024-11-10 17:39:35,t3_1gmpbu4,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gmpbu4/choosing_a_relationship_with_a_rso/lwfwtup/

lw2ns08,comment,,"Probably not much.  

Most sex offender laws are at the state level so the presidential and congressional elections will have little effect. Congress could theoretically revise SORNA to make it more onerous but I haven’t heard anything on that.  Possibly tougher prosecutors could be appointed but most of the day to day prosecutions are done by the rank and file guys.  There are strict sentencing guidelines so I’m not sure how anything would be affected.

I guess if there is some state that made a dramatic change in state government from blue to red, or if some governor got elected on a tough on crime platform then that could be a problem. But most sex offender laws have been on the books for a long time now and other than minor tweaks here and there I don’t think there is much to be done.

Just my opinion.",14,,2024-11-08 13:16:25,t3_1gmenlu,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gmenlu/does_the_new_direction_of_america_have_any_impact/lw2ns08/

lw15ecu,comment,,I'm so sorry. I got 15years of probation. Feels like a lifetime but I feel for those that do have life time. I couldn't imagine. I did time with people that got life time supervision and others that didn't get nearly as much as me. I guess it's the different circuits. I'm in the tenth circuit. But my state is said to be one of the hardest for sex offenders on probation. We have a somb. Which is a sex offender management board. Some states don't have that so they are more lenient. Florida is the most harsh state. You can look up the best states to move to. I'm thinking about moving to a different state to get through my probation. Try to stay positive everyone. I know it's hard. There are days when I just want to end everything. And unfortunately they are more frequent then the days I feel at least OK. Keep our heads up and remind ourselves that at least most of us are actually good people that made a mistake. We are not our charge. It does not define who we are. If you learned from your mistake and intend to never do it again then everyone deserves a second chance. We are valuable and worthwhile. I'm sorry I'm ranting but I know how this whole thing and the stigma behind it makes people look at us like scum and it's so easy to start believing it and fall into negativity.

lwzt68x,comment,,"Moving to Denmark is quite tricky. My dad just went through the process of acquiring permanent residency under “family reunification” because both of his parents were born there and he wanted to have options for his retirement. I can confirm that they do an in depth background check on all applicants. Because he has no criminal history and his parents were both Danish citizens, he was approved fairly quickly. That being said, Denmark is extremely selective. My family and I are still unsure if they’ll give permanent residency to my sister and I even if my dad goes all the way through the citizenship process. 

If you have family there or have a job in place, that can help quite a lot. 

I don’t have any information on whether or not they are willing to overlook criminal history, but I plan to start researching whether or not they’ll grant permanent residency to my partner due to his status. 

My best advice is to look into what could qualify YOU for permanent residency and start learning Danish. If they approve you and you stay long enough to apply for citizenship, they require you to speak Danish fluently during your citizenship test. You don’t need to be able to read or write, but you need to understand it and be understood. Gaining citizenship for yourself and potentially marrying your partner would likely give you the best chance at him being allowed to stay permanently in Denmark. 

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out any time and I’ll help as much as I can. All of this is super fresh for my family and I because my dad literally just got approved 2 days ago.",1,,2024-11-13 22:40:53,t3_1glstsh,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1glstsh/can_my_boyfriend_move_to_or_at_least_visit/lwzt68x/

There are certain circumstances that don’t apply when you own a small number of housing units or if you own a historic building (ex… they don’t expect someone to gut a 200 year old building and put in handicap accessible elevators and ramps when it isn’t feasible to do - they don’t expect someone renting a room in their own house to rent to someone they don’t like or put in handicap ramps, they don’t expect someone with a duplex that they live in to rent to someone with toddlers or loud children, etc….)

lw3soru,comment,,"Virginian here 

Registration differs depending on offense and can range from 10 years to a lifetime. There are restrictions on where you can move as a car as how close to playgrounds, etc. In regards to schools you will have to reach out to superintendent of that county to get permission, which could involve your family having to go to a school board meeting to get permission to attend school functions, pickup when sick etc.  So could have some consequences from patents in the school for you or your child. All social media and emails address will be registered along with jobs and a picture. Depending on offense, it could be multiple times a year or once a year. They also do random home and job checks especially for Halloween. All of this is done by state troopers (prior to covid you could go through the county and they would send it). Any travel over 3 days must be reported and once he completes his register he will still have to ask the court to be removed. 

In regards to probation the ones for SORs are generally stricter but as long as you follow their rules no matter how extravagant they are easy. Usually they will go to the court on their own if he is doing well enough to ge released off probation as there are usually only one in an office that handles these types of offenders

lvsn78p,comment,,"This is opinion, not legal advice.

From what I understand (this is not unequivocal fact, this is what I’ve heard, read, or been told - any of it has the potential to be misinformation) :

- They can’t clone an iPhone without the passcode. They can often extract data, but not clone it. So if they don’t have the passcode it isn’t cloned. 

- They generally won’t give it back until their investigation is done if they suspect illegal content. 

- They won’t give it back at all if they find illegal content. 

- If you didn’t provide a passcode, there’s a good chance that the tools they used to try to crack your passcode bricked the phone (I read one case where a guy did get his phone back but he was locked out of it for something like 30 years because of all the passcode attempts from the software they used)  and a lot of the data extraction tools will also brick the phone by making it unwritable - so there’s a decent chance that the phone won’t be usable if you do get it back.

- If they can’t get in to it or extract any data at all but found other evidence somewhere else then they may not return it at all. (Citing the likelihood of it containing illegal images) 

- If they can’t get all the data then they may not return it until the case is closed. 

From what it looks like in the cases I have read, and I have only read a few of these cases so take it for what it’s worth, the Feds don’t have to provide sufficient reason why they need it beyond “evidence,” it’s more on you to prove why you need it back right now and that it’s causing you some sort of hardship not to have it.  

A lot of people never get their property returned. A lot of people get it back bricked. 

Again, I do not know how accurate that is. But I would listen to your attorney about not poking the bear. 

Maybe u/gphs will chime in with a far more educated and better answer than I could ever have because, again, those are just things I’ve read or been told.",6,,2024-11-06 22:18:35,t3_1gl9tb5,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gl9tb5/iphone_seized_by_feds_for_five_months_without/lvsn78p/

Also, you can just get a new phone with the same #?  Doesn't have to be an iphone or expensive or anything.  Yeah it won't have the data but you mentioned things linked to the number.

Sounds weird to advise you not to get a lawyer...I'm not an expert though, so I don't get how something could be sealed to your lawyer?

Raided August 2023, arrested October 2023 (the usual 6am smashing on the door).  Spoke to a lawyer in August/September 2023 about getting my stuff back. He basically told me you can apply but you’d have to put it in writing that the stuff belongs to you. Depending on your defence options you may not want to give them that. 

It’s now been over a year. We’ve gotten the forensics reports from all the devices they seized (over 10k worth of electronics). We’ve asked multiple times to get back what has been cleared and the crown just ignores the emails. 

They have no desire to give anything back and asking for it will likely just strengthen their desire to withhold it. The only thing the prosecution/crown/police want is to make your life as impossible/annoying as possible so they can get you to admit to everything and anything whether you did it or not.

lvriqq4,comment,,"Call your registration office and ask them if you’re worried about whether it’s legal or not. 

If you’re worried about other things - Do you work in teams? Do you have to go inside? Will you be there alone? Don’t put yourself in a position to be alone with someone in their home. Even people without SO convictions are far more cautious about that these days. 

The general contractor I’ve used for years showed up with an older female assistant the last time he came to give me a quote. We’ve been friends(ish) for years so I asked him later if business was so good that he needed one. He said he has her there for his own safety. She helps with quotes and paperwork, but she’s primarily there because so many are accused of being inappropriate (or worse) that he decided it was the smartest course of action to take in order to avoid that. 

If you’re working in a team and it’s legal to do then I wouldn’t hesitate.

There are so many uncertain things right now, but don't dwell on anything that you don't have control over. Concentrate on what you can control - the first of those is getting on with your life. It's been 20 years since I went through that, and I know it's tough.

Yes that part is true and that needs to be taken in to account but you still spoke to them and and until you accept some responsibility for what you did do then you will not move on. 

A lot of my case was not true and that still hurts but there were parts that did happen and I have to accept that because of some of my mistakes, the lens in which people looked at me was different. It wasn’t fair but it was understandable. 

You know in yourself what your motives were and you have to accept responsibility for the things you did wrong. Only when you are able to face that and forgive yourself will you be able to move on.  

I know my motives and I am able to live with myself because I know that it wasn’t what people thought but I still accept that my actions were not good and I put myself in a position that I shouldn’t have. I also have to accept that because of that I have caused myself a lot of pain and I’ve caused those that care about me pain too.

Don't panic too much it's getting escalated to crown, As I said, first offence for downloading is usually suspended sentence and x amount of years on the register with as SHPO, the Judge will give you a ticking off and usually a fine. My main advice is wear a face covering when leaving the court just in case there's media taking pictures. I left looking like a bank robber. You will be given a probation  for the length of the suspension, my sentence was suspended for 2 years so 2 years of seeing probation. Probation workers are OK though and are trying to help.

lvxu0j3,comment,,"Hello! New here, I ultimately ended up on the registry after an ugly divorce got even uglier.  Long story short is I’m approaching my 5th year on the registry and probation.  I was sentenced to 2 years probation and 10 years on the registry.    Well after my 2 years of probation were up I went down to see my P.O. Thinking I was going to be somewhat a free man!   Well turns out in my state (IA) they have this things call a special sentence !  So now I am on my 10 year special sentence.  So technically I have to serve about 4 1/2 years of that as one day essentially is 2 ( good time).  So I have 2 years and about 9 months left.  I was fortunate enough to keep my job through all of this.   I have my own place and live alone.   I just live my life and enjoy the little  freedom I do have!   Once this special sentence is over I am going to try and get off the registry early and after 8 years I will try to get my charge expunged.   It’s crazy all I seem to do is wish time by!  I have a countdown until the end of this. ( depressing I know) but it gives me hope.   After a 4 year relationship     just ended ( it’s hard for someone to have to go through this with you).  They’re basically on probation as well and it’s terrible.    I just tell myself once I get over this I can then focus on finding my new partner and hopefully live stress and anxiety free!",1,,2024-11-07 18:31:04,t3_1gk5hu2,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gk5hu2/what_were_your_final_years_of_probation_like/lvxu0j3/

Just ride it out. 6 months in is nothing. Give it time, he'll likely get off your back. It's a gradual process. Just remember they assume the worst about everyone whose papers come across their desk, they EXPECT you to violate, and assume you're just waiting for the chance. Trust takes time.

It would be fairly intensive for their installed software to scan your phone too, even with the assumption most smart phones in the US have a ""lot"" of computing power and storage. The FBI has a database of hashes that represent flagged images as illicit. When doing a scan a program would need to go through parts of your phone's filesystem, compute a hash representing any images it finds, and check that hash against a massive list of hashes. Doing that over the wire would be slow and inconsistent. They wouldn't want to load that list of hashes on your phone either for a variety of reasons too.",1,,2024-11-05 15:59:24,t3_1gjw17a,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gjw17a/remotecon/lvjg3tb/

When my PO showed up all angry, I told her maybe I had used the word as part of a videogame or something, because I couldn't remember every word I've said in the last week (or even day lol).  She got more and more freaked out as I explained that I played games on my laptop, even an MMO, and used discord.  She thought I was doing crazy stuff I guess?  She told me she was going to have my polygrapher ask me a bunch of questions about it at my next appointment (which was soon).

I went in for my poly and it was the same as ever.  When i asked the guy if my PO had talked to him about the incident he just shook his head and said she was having a LOT of trouble with the amount of freedom SOs had, specifically w/ technology.  He said the questions he asks every time covered any of her worries, such as if I was violating my conditions, lying to my PO, etc.

lvi98jv,comment,,"I and a co-author published research about disenfranchisement some years ago, when I was in law school. We found that states that permanently disenfranchise people have a roughly 10% higher rate of re-arrest than states that don't. It got cited in the recent 5th Circuit decision striking down Mississippi's disenfranchisement law (yay) before being cited again in the dissent in the en banc decision reversing the panel (boo). [Link. ](https://lawcat.berkeley.edu/record/1125056?ln=en)

I also wrote about my own experiences of voting again for Slate, after many years of being prohibited from doing so. [Link. ](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/12/kentucky-voting-rights-restoration-clemency.html)

The TLDR is that it is an anachronism in a first-world democracy, a holdover from our legacy of slavery, and Jim Crow, which have now morphed into our system of mass incarceration that disproportionately impacts people of color.

I think that disenfranchisement is one of the reasons we have such a mass incarceration problem in this country, and why our conditions of confinement are so appalling. You have a massive group of people who are politically powerless, despite being in the most intimate relationship one can be in with their government, and who politicians repeatedly dunk on in a quest to see who can be more punitive with zero political pushback. If they had to worry about the polls, then perhaps they might consider whether new mandatory minimums are a good idea, and perhaps they would be more responsive to say, medical needs in prison. But that's a different story.

You should be able to. Everyone should be able to. Even people in prison. Two states, Maine and Vermont, allow that (though they are also extremely white, so the animating forces behind disenfranchisement aren't as pronounced in those states).",4,,2024-11-05 11:39:11,t3_1gjvth5,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gjvth5/prohibited_from_voting_due_to_probation/lvi98jv/

lvf4stg,comment,,Yes they are. There are some spots where if your typing an email another inmate will be looking over your shoulder for any information on the significant other so they can use it as ammo against them. It's tough being like that. I was like that for a long time ( I did 11 years) but... I did it in a low security federal prison. It's still difficult to show emotion especially in visiting. Everyone is watching and analyzing. Remorse will come when the time is right. I got released 5 months ago. And I'm trying to patch everything back with my brothers. They have their own lives now and I'm not trying to be a burden. That's what we feel like sometimes. I cant speak for everyone. Give it time. Let him do his thing.

lvfab44,comment,,"I can’t answer most of this, but I do know the following -

- Prisons here don’t allow more than a brief hug and a quick kiss. 

- People in general, but men especially, tend to shut down when they’ve created a problem they’re unable to fix. Men tend to be fixers while women tend to be more compassionate listeners (obviously this isn’t an always thing, but it’s pretty well documented that it’s a “most” thing and I’m sure you know which of those your husband is most of the time.) He’s currently in a place where he can’t fix the situation so he may just be shutting down as a defense mechanism. 

- Depending on the people around him, it may not be safe for him to talk about it. 

- It’s also possible that he doesn’t feel the way you think he should / want him to.

lvfdyd5,comment,,"Though everyone experiences similar emotions, we experience them differently.

https://www.paulekman.com/blog/experience-universal-emotions/

Also, people emote differently. Ekman has written about how the show ""Friends"" changed the way we expect emotionality from others into an unrealistic standard. The idea that remorse ""looks a certain way"" is also part of law enforcement and the media's attachment to junk pseudoscience which relies on specific cues that are not present for everyone or at the same intensity.

Also, your LO may be dealing with daily trauma and feeling unsafe, and doesn't want to burden you with these experiences. While pushing his wheelchair-bound cellmate might seem like a leisure activity, I can assure that pill line (where the cellmate is likely being pushed to twice a day) is a nightmare of greedy jerks.

That said, relationships are dynamic and can change. He may have been one way during your time living together, but will react differently while incarcerated, and then be different again afterwards.

The state only required yearly registration with quarterly mail verification of registration. I am assuming your trip is a basic vacation type trip. 

However, if you are moving where you are deregistering when you leave and establishing a new residence/temporary residence when you return, or other normal situation when you return from your trip - or- if your return is when you normally have to go in person to register, then you would have to register with the authorities upon your return. 

There also appears to be a FAQ section on their Hawaii Sex Offender Page. [click here](https://sexoffenders.ehawaii.gov/sexoffender/faq.html)

It also never hurts to double check with the registration office when you turn in your 21 day travel notice by asking a general question like, ''Is there anything else I need to do now or when I return from my trip?""

lvsr04z,comment,,"I ended up marrying a man who was awaiting trial. His trial was dragged out 6 years. He ended up getting probation and being an RSO. Honestly, it was an extremely hard decision to keep seeing him after he told me the situation. He told me pretty early on. Only you know your boyfriend and how you feel. I decided to believe and trust my guy, but just because I made that choice, does not mean it's right for everyone. 

Do think of how it will affect your child too. I have a stepdaughter, husband's bio daughter, who is our world. But him being an RSO does limit what we can do together. We can never go to Disney World or the State Fair. Small things, but they do add up over time. He can't even take her to build a bear. We have full custody, but the things we can do with her are limited. I often end up handing things like birthday parties solo.

Also, look up RSO requirements in your state. It varies wildly. Some states have much worse restrictions than others. I'm not saying these things to be doom and gloom, just want you to know the basics of what to look out for. Personally, although sometimes it is hard, I do not regret my own choice to stay.

Got together with a woman with 4 kids, and I believe he genuinely loved all of them. For 2 years Jesse was a regular family man and everything was great. Then one day Jesse finds out he’s going back to prison for crimes committed during his first sentence. So Jesse decides to go out in a blaze of glory. Shoots all 5 of his new family- the mom and the 4 kids. Handcuffs and rapes 2 girls all night who were over for a slumber party. Kills them. Kills himself. After the bodies were found and the girls parents found out, all they could say was that if they knew McFadden was a sex offender, they would have never let their girls go to that house. I’m not trying to put everyone in the same box. But this is something that happened in real life even though we all wish that it didn’t.

lv9f27d,comment,,"I have apartments that i only rent to people coming out of prison with a sex offense. There is hope! If there is a concern of him losing his current housing, losing his job, where all of his things will go, that is something that you can probably get figured out before his trial. It would be better for both of you if you did figure it out before his trial. If he could do a mutual lease recession if he is at a an apartment complex or renting, or if he owns he could look into renting out his home and you could possibly manage that rental, which would give him an income on the inside. You would need to look at all of that, possibly getting things put into your name or something, I'm definitely not a lawyer so you would have to talk to someone else about that or look up the rules and regulations. If you do not believe that he will be serving time in prison then there is a chance that he can just stay where he is at, depending on the state. Apartments normally only run one background check and it is when you get the apartment, so there is a chance that they won't even know anything about the case and he will be fine, again it depends on what state you are in. As far as probation / parole, he would be assigned an officer and they would just check in with him, make sure he is doing whatever he needs to be doing, some states require a weekly schedule letting them know everywhere you will be during the week and approximate times that you will be there, and you have to drop those off weekly. Other states you just meet with your officer once a month.

lva7xcb,comment,,"Also would like more info.  I was raided back in \~2010, arrested maybe 1.5 years later for CP.  I was on pre-trial ankle monitor for a little over a year.  But I don't think being on pre-trial meant anything with regards to apartment or work or anything.  I wasn't on any registry yet.  I guess an employer could've googled me and found that I had been raided?  But the only thing that comes up is pretty vague, just mentions some electronic devices were seized.

I wound up doing 5 years for receipt of CP, and when I got out I was in a halfway house for 7 months.  HWH are great for looking for work/housing.  I got a job at chipotle, and found a surprisingly good apartment in a crap part of town.  But it was quiet and didn't have bugs.  Only downside was we'd get homeless going through our dumpsters, since we were across from a university, but it was no big deal.  I needed some $$ help from my mom, so I wasn't completely on my own, but close enough.  I got a better job after a year at a restaurant, and a much better restaurant job after covid.

I was only a tier 1 when I got my apartment, so I'm not sure if I would have been able to get it once I was bumped up to tier 2 (horrible law was enacted here in NV that bumped thousands of people up a tier).  I don't think my apartment manager did THAT much work.  They only required 2x rent as income instead of 3, and like I said, cheap and not great part of town heh.  I moved in w/ my 2 best friends last year, so I still can't say how it is to find an apartment.

As far as work, food service, and I'm sure other fields, really don't do a thorough background check.  My guess is that all the restaurants I applied to interviewed a pile of people, and then checked the social media of the 2-3 they were interested in.",3,,2024-11-04 02:02:54,t3_1gizo17,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gizo17/worries_about_future/lva7xcb/
lvf27c7,comment,,"When you say pre-trial, do you mean pre-trial indictment hearing? This shouldn't result in any changes.

In our situation, which was state, my husband went to his and his attorney stated there had been no turn over of discovery and the judge gave the prosecution 90 days. They never turned it over and case was adjudicated without prejudice (meaning they can bring it again) that was April 2023. Well they did bring it again, he was rearrested but allowed to volunteraily surrender in Sept 2024 and we start the process again, his now pre trial indictment this time around is Dec. (Got pushed back 3 times since oct).

What I expect is the same as last time, and at worse maybe they ask for more pretrial monitoring which arguablely would be unnecessary since he hasn't violated his pretrial probation either time he has been on it.

I think this time the new prosecutor will get the discovery out and indictment together within the legally permitted 90 days. Without having another technical dismissal. I think we will get a plea offer between Dec and March... I can't imagine them dropping the ball a second time

lv9ihwd,comment,,"Thank you. The apartment concern comes from when he was first arrested, the leasing office notified him that someone had seen his arrest on the news. The leasing gal I spoke with was amazing. Basically she said he was innocent until proven guilty. However, based on what happened initially I'm assuming the complex pulls monthly SO lists. The lease he signed stated NO SEX OFFENDERS. Since he is not on a list yet he was truthful when he re-upped his lease for another year. No one ever reached out to him and asked.  I was thinking that once we know a verdict, there might be a way with letters from his counselor, his support group members they would be able to convince the complex he is not dangerous and could live out the rest of his lease. He has always paid on time, never caused any problems, and follows the rules. His charge was downloading and sharing CSAM. He is a first time offender, but we all know the broad brush the SO registry is. I am definitely not a fan of putting someone on a public list for this, especially if a first offense. But that is my opinion. 

Secondly, how did you get into renting to SO's?  I have often thought about doing something like this, but don't have much in the way of funds to buy something. Did you petition people to help? Did you get grants? I thought about if I did something like this, only employ companies that are owned and staffed with majority of SO's to also help on that end.",2,,2024-11-03 23:35:04,t1_lv9f27d,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gizo17/worries_about_future/lv9ihwd/

And as a matter of fact today I was having a conversation with a fellow member in church and I was telling him that it seems like none of this ever happened. I served 5 years in prison and I am on parole for life for 15 years whatever you want to say but sometimes when I wake up and I'm a little dazed and I think about it I wonder if it really happened until my thoughts get together and I realize that I did do five years in prison and I have been out of prison for 5 years.

lv4uloa,comment,,"I had this problem a couple of weeks ago. The first solution you seemed to have found in one of my previous replies. I don't use that solution anymore because it's not needed after I contacted them. So let me explain what happened.

There is a folder that they use to store screenshots. You should find it at C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\RemoteCOM\\AgentApplication\\ScreenShotsTempStore. Now the name has ""temp"" in it but it isn't fucking temporary. That thing had like 40GB of screenshots. I placed a ticket with RemoteCOM and asked them to delete those files. They had screen shots from 6 months previous. The tech guy, who was Indian, just deleted all the files. I told my PO what they did so I didn't get blamed. After that there were no input lag. The folder is getting screenshots again so I'll call them when it gets to 10GB to delete the files. 

So besides moving some apps to different processors this was the only thing I did. After the tech freed up space I never had to move apps to a different processor.

lva4jsf,comment,,"I had remotecom from 2018\~2023 (not have ntcp or somthing).  My laptop wasn't anything special, certainly not a gaming laptop, but I didn't have any trouble running games.  There WAS a point where I was able to play overwatch fine, and then a week later it was just a bit too choppy/blurred for me to play comfortably.  GEforce now had it for a while and could play perfectly, but then they lost the rights grrr.

Have you tried having them reinstall it?  I had a super crap laptop for the first year or so, then got one that was on a huge sale, a $900 down to 300ish.  STILL wasn't a gaming laptop but it at least had better than garbage specs.  I had to have them put remotecom on 3-4x because I kept messing everything up when updating my drivers lol.  Had to reinstall windows and needed them to put it back on.  After the last time, they said if it happened again I'd have to pay the $30 or whatever their fee is.  Here in NV/Vegas we don't have to pay for monitoring, polygraphs, therapy, etc.  Not for federal receipt of CP anyway.  The couple guys I remember from group that had to pay were doing it pre-sentencing/arrest as a way to look good to a judge.

You could ask your PO if they intend to keep remotecom or if they intend to switch to NCPTC.  Maybe it's something that could easily be swapped.  Remotecom wasn't able to work on iphones though.  Here, they let us have iphones w/o monitoring software, and just looked through the phone randomly.

lv1tvkb,comment,,"Depending on the state, it's not really that hard. I work for a very young non-profit. I didn't start it, but I was there from the beginning. Like most people who starts businesses, starting a nonprofit is basically doing the best you can and figuring it out as you go. 

For instance, we just now learned that we have to charge sales tax on items going to entities other than the State. Our main customer is the State, but we do sell items to other non-profits or even for profits. 

Our main purpose is to connect men and women leaving prison with resources in their communities. We found that there are a lot of resources in most counties, but the non-profits have problems finding those leaving prison and those leaving prison don't know about the resources. 

We are deeply involved with the corrections department in our state. It's totally about meeting people constantly. Our fearless leader probably spends 70% of his time on the road meeting people and the remaining time on Zoom. It's paid off big time. We have an open agreement now with the State which should migrate into a sole-source contract soon. 

Getting started took some money just like a for profit business. We had churches, other non-profits, and individuals donate money to get started. I donated money to get started. 

Starting a non-profit isn't much different than starting a for-profit biz. You don't have to be perfect. You do need to address a particular problem or niche. Don't worry about mistakes. Everybody makes mistakes. It's not a big deal.",7,,2024-11-02 17:52:41,t3_1gi0d05,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gi0d05/has_anyone_successfully_started_a_nonprofit_in/lv1tvkb/
lv2oq9a,comment,,"For anyone considering doing this, here is a summary of the legal steps for starting a Not For Profit business (independent of state):

1. Form a Nonprofit Corporation:
   * Choose a Name: Select a name that's unique and reflects your mission.
   * Draft Articles of Incorporation: This document outlines the organization's purpose, structure, and governance.
   * File with the Secretary of State: Submit the Articles of Incorporation to your state's Secretary of State's office.

2. Obtain an Employer Identification Number (EIN):
   * Apply for an EIN from the IRS. This is necessary for tax purposes and opening bank accounts.

3. Develop Bylaws:
   * Create bylaws that detail the organization's internal operations, including roles and responsibilities of board members and officers.

4. Hold an Organizational Meeting:
   * Convene an initial meeting of the board of directors to adopt the bylaws, elect officers, and authorize the opening of bank accounts.

5. Apply for 501(c)(3) Tax-Exempt Status:
   * File IRS Form 1023 or 1023-EZ to request tax-exempt status. This allows you to receive tax-deductible donations.

6. Register with State Authorities:
   * Depending on your state, you may need to register with additional state agencies, such as the Department of Revenue or Attorney General's office.

Additional Considerations:

* Consult with an Attorney: Seek legal advice to ensure compliance with all regulations and to help navigate the complex process.
* Develop a Business Plan: Outline your organization's mission, goals, programs, and financial projections.
* Secure Funding: Identify potential sources of funding, such as grants, donations, and fundraising events.",4,,2024-11-02 20:38:06,t3_1gi0d05,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gi0d05/has_anyone_successfully_started_a_nonprofit_in/lv2oq9a/

lv0990t,comment,,"It depends on the relationship.  During my charges I lost almost everyone.  No one was intentionally mean. It was a combination of people not showing up and me wanting to isolate.  Two good friends stuck it out with me and we were purposeful about getting together weekly.  We openly talked about the court process. 

Post incarceration it took me a long time to be social again particularly in large groups like my church where I knew everyone else knew but nobody would say a word.  I’m at 2.5 yrs now and have rebuilt a social circle.  I still have a few long time friends, I have people from my S group who know my story and we socialize, a romantic partner who I’ve disclosed to and a bunch of people that I hang out with who have no idea. There are some struggles since I’m still on paper and I need to find creative ways to avoid violations. 

Not everyone needs to know or deserves to know my full story.  I don’t need to know their full biography in order to enjoy time together.  At some point though deeper relationships require a disclosure.  People who I’ve disclosed to usually already know that I was divorced, my life fell apart and I’m working on rebuilding it.  Some know that I had legal issues some know that I dealt with addiction.  But after a full disclosure to a friend, not one has left me over it.  There is always that risk but have deep relationships there has to be vulnerability.  

TLDR. Not every friend needs to be told but when you do tell, real friends will stick by you.",5,,2024-11-02 12:21:41,t3_1ghm10q,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1ghm10q/relationships_as_a_pandoras_box/lv0990t/

Regardless of whether you're on the lease or not if you live there more than 72 hours and have a mail going to that address you are a tenant there. And therefore you have tenants rights. Which means that if you refuse to leave you landlord cannot just kick you out he would have to legally evict you. And he would have to have just cause to do that. Meaning he can't just evict you because he doesn't want you there. There is a loophole where he can evict you if he claims he wants to use the house for personal use. Meaning he wants to move in there. But anyway reach out to you landlord tell him you have been living there all these years paying rent on time and you would like to continue to do so.

luyugn5,comment,,"

It’s really easy to mourn, romanticize, or fantasize about the life you think you could have if something had been different.  

But here’s the thing, you don’t know what it would be like. Whatever idea is in your head is fantasy, it’s not reality. For all you know, your friends could’ve moved away and your wife had a sordid affair with the postman. There’s no guarantee anything would be better. 

While you’re “what-iffing” you’re not living. You’re not enjoying what you do have. You’re not giving your brain the space for anything good. 

It’s okay to “what if” sometimes. But give yourself a time limit. Assign 5 minutes a week - on Wednesday at 3:30 you’re allowed to “what if” for 5 minutes. Any other time it pops in your head you have to wait, can’t think about it. It’s scheduled and that’s the only time you can. 

Eventually you get your mind out of that cycle. 

One of the things I love most about my guy is that he finds happiness in little things. Despite the fact he has some of the strictest probation rules possible, despite having a job he hates, even despite having to put up with me typing this while he’s standing on a ladder half-glaring, half smiling at me. 

You have to change the way you think. You have to find happiness in small things and let that build in to bigger things. Happy people attract happy people. 

It’s not easy to change the way your brain works, but it’s doable. Start by scheduling your 5 minutes a week. It works.",6,,2024-11-02 03:33:55,t3_1ghhhzz,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1ghhhzz/getting_through_special_days/luyugn5/

For your birthday, I recommend that you pre-plan your day. Find ways of doing something you enjoy, something that will keep you busy . And my therapy group, the last assignment we have deals with how we move forward in a big part of that is preplanning. We all had weak moments, and sometimes you can anticipate that because you know something is coming up and will make you feel vulnerable. And the best way to attack that is to anticipated preplan and deal with it.

lv16ewh,comment,,"  You need to put that into your past and live for today and your future. My situation also changed after my arrest however that has made me a stronger person. The worst has happened to me and nothing worse can ever happen to me. And I survived it. It is a liberating feeling. The other day there was an incident on my job where somebody stole something and my boss made a statement that I should be careful because he may have had a gun and such and he could have shot me and this could have went much worse than it did. My response to him was that the worst has already happened to me. There is nothing I fear or nothing I worry about happening. Because I know I will be able to face it head on and survive like I did with my situation. I also get bummed out around Christmas and holidays. I will make a disclaimer before I continue. I am not a religious freak . I believe there has to be a balance of spirituality, religion family and friendship in a person. And I have found that balance. During Christmas Easter and other holidays people for my church know of my situation and know that I live alone and they bring me trays of foods and pastries and cakes and stuff for me to bring home. So perhaps you local church could be an asylum for you where you go there and are forgiven and accepted regardless of your situation. In addition please keep in mind that you can choose your family. A lot of my biological family did not stand by me throughout my case. Of course I have written them off and have never spoken to them. It is as if they are dead to me as if I've already gone through the funerals they've been buried and never to be seen again. However I keep  some individuals around me some are maybe mother figures others or father figures or others are brother figures and these people love me and support me in any way that they can. So branch out there find some people to be around you that make you feel good and support you and move on with your life and let the past be the past the present be the present and the future be the future.

luyzufg,comment,,"I don't think the PSI is the point for that.  When i was arrested, they did my PSI that morning.  It was a lengthy interview where he basically asked my life story.  AFTER that, he asked for some contact information based on my story, so he could call them and ask about me.  I didn't know many numbers off the top of my head though, so I gave him my aunt's, best friend's, and uh....I think another aunt.  He was only able to get ahold of my best friend though, but I guess that was enough, because when the prosecutor wanted no bail, my lawyer argued for house arrest/ankle monitor, and the PSI guy said he didn't object to that.

Many people in the system, like my PO and therapist, literally aren't allowed to say ANYTHING on my behalf.  The best they can do is not object, it's ridiculous.  But the judge knew that, so he gave the PSI-er a lot of weight and I was let out on my own recognizance.

I was on ankle monitoring for a bit over a year, and way later on, my lawyer told me to get some letters of support or whatever they're called.  I asked some friends and family and I think they sent them to me and I gave them to my lawyer, who then got them to the judge somehow.  I don't know if he read them or got the gist or what, but he DID mention them at sentencing.

Also no clue if they had any effect whatsoever, but I did get pretty lucky.  I was looking at 10-12 years due to the stupid enhancement pt system, but my judge sentenced me to 6.",1,,2024-11-02 04:17:13,t3_1gh8l8n,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gh8l8n/psi/luyzufg/

luyzbvn,comment,,"I did 5 years for receipt of CP.  When I got out I had to do both group and 1 on 1 sessions. At first I was pretty resistant.  Firstly because I didn't really think I needed therapy.  Group was kind of like this reddit, in that I don't personally need much help other than with mechanics, such as getting off probation or dealing w/ a PO type stuff.  Nothing with urges or violating or anything.  But I'm able to share my own experiences and help others sometimes.

My first therapist was a bit old and stuffy as well.  So our 1 on 1s felt kind of generic as well.  Though, he did help me figure out why I got into CP in the first place (repressed sexual stuff/gay stuff). So he definitely did his job, but I didn't have as good a rapport with him that I did with my 2nd/current therapist.

At first I wasn't thrilled about getting a chick therapist.  How was I supposed to talk about j/o or anything like that, but she's really a tough old lady that doesn't take shit from anyone.  

I was only in group for a bit over a year.  Once I finished the workbook I was able to choose whether to keep going or not.  Even though I never had to pay for it, I just didn't really feel like I need it.  Plus it's like 10 miles away so...I stopped lol.  I had 1 on 1 sessions every 2 weeks, then every month, getting farther and farther apart til it's 1/year now.  Each time I go in she asks if I think I need to keep going, and I say yes.  Even though we rarely if ever talk about any of my SO stuff.  Sometimes we just talk about whatever's going on, sometimes we mainly talk about her stuff lol.  Her daughter's boyfriend or her surgery or something.

It's rare, but whenever I have a question about my situation, she's the first person I ask.  Usually the answer is to tell my PO about whatever it is, but not always.  I know she's obligated to report certain things if they came up, but all in all i definitely feel like she's on my side/wants me to succeed.  I've seen some stories here on reddit where they feel their therapist is against them or doesn't care.  That's gotta suck big time.

I always thought it was weird when people would lie in group.  We'd tell them that we're aaaaaaaaaaall SOs here, and they don't need to try and hide stuff.",1,,2024-11-02 04:12:49,t3_1gh5px7,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gh5px7/experience_with_mandated_so_counseling/luyzbvn/

luvyyej,comment,,"I was mandated by my DOC to attend SOT while on supervision. Courts said to abide by any and all treatment required by DOC. It was a pay as you go and it was chosen by my agent.  It was suppose to be in person group but covid started and ended up being one on one on the phone for a month.  Eventually became a zoom meeting and it was a group setting.  I felt comfortable with the facilitator because they report all things to your agent. That's from doing homework, participation, and being on time.  I am currently off supervision as of  February 2023 and I still go to SOT when I'm not mandated to work. The only thing I didn't like was we had sometimes 12 people in group. The check-ins took forever and I could never present homework or activity requests.  That's the only thing I hated.  I like the advice everyone gives each other in a group setting.   Everyone is trying not to reoffend and we help with skills to not reoffend.  Those that reoffend or violate probation  are drinking,drugs,secret phone, failing polygraphs. Most failed polys are some form of hiding something like things I mentioned.

luw0bkv,comment,,"I'm not an RSO, my husband is going through the whole process right now (two years no indictment yet). 

But I am a recent law school graduate, who just signed up for the BAR yesterday, and saw all the questions. 

You could go to law school and pass with flying colors, pass the bar, but if you don't make it through the Character and Fitness part you can't be admitted even after all your hard work. I think it's possible in some states that they'd admit you, however, strategically you'd want to apply in a state that accepts UBE this way you don't have to take the bar again. 

For example, if I don't get admitted in NJ due to C&F issue, even though I passed the bar, I cannot take my passing bar score to Delaware bc they don't accept UBE. And I am sure as shit not going to take the bar again. However I could apply using my bar score in NY and see if their C&F committee will grant me approval. Although, you have to put on your Bar app if you've ever applied to and been denied in another state.

Ive heard of ppl who have been convicted and served time for murder and theyve been granted acceptance to the Bar. I think it is highly dependent on the state you're applying for admission to (Blue would be more tolerant) and how much distance and time is between you and the offense. Obviously making amends for it in the community would bode well. But it is never a guarantee bc of the character and fitness portion of the application. That goes for everyone - I have mass debit and been sued a few times bc of debit and my small business, plus had a dui, I'm terrified of how my c&f interview will go. They get on ppl for accidently failing to disclose a parking ticket!

Lastly, even if you pass and are accepted to the Bar you've got to consider the background checks at the law firms and companies. 

If i were you, consider things in the reverse. What type of law do I want to practice and in what state? Will that position require a background check? If so, will that hinder my ability to receive a legal position in that area of law? Small firms might not care and if you're going into a solo practice it really won't matter. Is the state I'm seeking to practice in tough on their C&F review (for example I've heard ppl in Florida had to write 20 page memo on candor). So on and so forth and maybe that will help you make your decision.",7,,2024-11-01 17:31:10,t3_1ggxucs,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1ggxucs/has_anyone_been_fortunate_enough_to_become_a/luw0bkv/

Yes, There are several hurdles. Getting into law school. Getting through law school. Getting to take the bar. Passing the bar. Then passing C&F to get licensed. 

However even if you can’t get barred, getting your JD qualifies you for many other jobs so it’s still worthwhile to pursue. 

I’m an attorney. I’m active in NARSOL. I’m not a PFR but I do get asked this question quite a bit. I believe all education is valuable and while it may be a difficult road, those hurdles are there to keep out the people who don’t want it bad enough. The more people that get past those hurdles, the more doors get opened for others who are in your same boat. The right of PFRs are restricted so much that every single PRF who accomplishes something like this helps out all of the others.

Along with 1 yr jail (did 7 months), 5 yrs probation (completed in dec 2022) and tier 1 15 yr SO registry, and case closed in 2022. I have, in my possession still, a stellar psycho-sexual evaluation from Dr.William Merrick (he's written a few books on the subject even) stating no paraphillic tendencies, extremely low risk to re-offend, no SO treatment, no SO registery, etc. Anyhow, gov Evers signed a law, circumventing the Supreme Court decision, that puts anyone with multiple charges on the same complaint on LIFETIME registration. Seems to me it's a violation of plea agreement by the state of Wisconsin, due process rights violation because there is zero recourse, and of course unrealized damages. My goal would be to reduce my charges (considering the damages and rights violated) to non SO registration charges (then I can sponsor my Irish wife and not get rejected by the USCIS AWA act), and get on with life.

If your goal is to establish a non-profit then law school can def help. You can learn about the criteria of a non profit business, how to establish one, and you can take tax law to learn how that side of non profits work.

Ppl have established them with either an MBA or a JD, or neither. 

In my law school we had clinical programs and there was one where law students helped ppl in the community create non profits. Actually, you should reach out to a state law school in your area and i bet they have a clinical program where they can help you.

I think that's great you want to start non profit for RSO and other formerly incarcerated ppl. I think that's amazing. Tbh you could go do that today right now, while youre pursuing your education!

luxfuem,comment,,"Who lives in Wisconsin?  We need a good attorney who can fight to get my son off the registry. It’s been 11 years. Misdemeanor. Actually a mistake but no one believes me because I’m his mom. He’s college graduate w honors, married, has a new baby, employed. This check in stuff is so invasive and upsetting and it’s because he remains on the registry. He did everything that was asked of him. Doctors said no mental dysfunction. His crime was to look at online pornography once and it was a “batch” that included children. He opened one, was shocked, and closed it right away but the link was being monitored by the FBI and area police. They were funded and had to get “numbers” we were told to justify the investment. He had never looked at pornography. Was a very innocent kid. A buddy goaded him and bet him he wouldn’t so this longtime undeserved hell is all because of a bet. So stupid but way overblown for some people. I know a guy convicted of grand theft, auto theft, domestic violence against women, even conspiracy to commit murder. He’s paranoid schizophrenic and in and out of jail like a swinging door. Five minutes of looking at something on your computer (w otherwise good normal behavior and life) versus a lifetime of crime and certifiable mental health problems just shouldn’t compare. Yet the SO label is worse than anything. So sad. Devastating.

luwy1hj,comment,,"Just know there is a difference from being an RSO on paper and not. Also depending on where you live. Where I used to live on probation had monthly check in, quarterly UA, around 1 every couple  months a rookie officer would stop and do a check, then once a year a task force woth the PD, sheriff dept, Marshall service and other agencies would get together and visit every RSO in the county. They show up in unmarked vehicles usually 3 or more, they verify some info, vehicle check, take your picture etc. Then you still have your bday check in. On Halloween they'd have RSOs in the city go down town for the peak trick or treat time. After probation(I'm low risk) I just have my yearly to deal with and Halloween just gotta stay home and turn off all the lights. Plus any city ordinances you may have in your area. The reason I mentioned depending on where you live. Where I used to live the RSO registration department was bad, always trying to find something to hem you up on.

lurbwjz,comment,,"Hi- this popped up on my reddit feed, probably because i used to work in housing (within the social work field). i have worked with clients that were registered and had to locate housing and a landlord who would work with them. you are correct when you say a majority of landlords will not work with individuals on the registry. most property owners view it as a liability and potentially dangerous to other residents/neighbors, although i do not know the circumstances regarding your husband. in my previous profession, here is what i did when i would have to locate housing for a client:

there are databases that exist where you can look up your city or address, and it will list offenders that live in proximity. nsopw.gov or FamilyWatchDog are two websites that give you the ability to do this. I CANNOT EMPHASIZE ENOUGH- DO THIS AS IT WILL GIVE YOU A STARTING POINT. it will show the addresses of where these individuals are currently residing. this is where a bit of researching comes in. in my job, i would look up these addresses to try see if it was a rental, find landlord information, etc. This will help you immensely in narrowing down rentals that have the possibility of renting to you. Of course, the severity of the charge matters a lot. I reside in WI, and in our state you can access all and any criminal charges, gives fairly specific details about court proceedings, etc. Take this into consideration, because landlords will perform background checks regardless.

Additionally, jails tend to have “re-entry” resources available. In my county, they can provide you with a list of landlords that they have vetted and would potentially be willing to work with those that have hefty criminal backgrounds. One thing to caution is if they have a list like this available, it could become outdated to a certain extent. 

The last thing I can recommend is talking to local housing agencies. The agency that I worked at had walk-in hours for discussing housing instability issues, and this was a common question for us to come across. We also did our best to keep a list of landlords that were more willing to work with those who had a background. A housing agency within your area could probably provide you the best resources of landlords who would be willing to work with you.

ETA: I just thought of this as well, if your husband has a parole officer, and again depending on the charges, the parole officer will most likely have to do a walkthrough of the property and ensure that it is an adequate location for the offender (ex. not near a school, parks, etc.) Again, i am based in WI, so it could be slightly different in CA, but wanted to offer you this information regardless",8,,2024-10-31 21:04:10,t3_1ggmfy0,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1ggmfy0/living_situation/lurbwjz/

There are some proactive things you can do such as file a motion to have a judge issue a ruling that your husband can live with you and his step children. This can be problematic but it is possible. They may start off with daytime only. This has the same effect of not living with you.

The judge may say no the first time because
* No treatment program provider notes 
* No polygraph results 
* No track record of compliance

It brings up issues because if kids have friends over and sleepovers, he has to leave. And Parole will ask on polys if he complied.

All that being said, I went in the day after my release and the judge let me have access to biological children. I don’t have any step-children.",0,,2024-10-31 20:46:45,t1_lur6s5v,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1ggmfy0/living_situation/lur8qro/

This can be used for the vending machines in the visitation room. Getting snacks from the vending machines is a big thing when you're an inmate.

They typically won't allow certain colors, if those colors are close to what the inmates wear. If you're female, they won't allow underwire bras or open toed shoes. Also, my son got denied once for wearing blue jeans that had a rip in them. He had to go to a local store and buy a pair of pants.

Be prepared to wait for a long time unless you're there very early. One place I served gave visitors buzzers so they could wait in the car for their turn. The other place I served made everyone stand in line the whole time.

Unfortunately, the feedback I got from some visitors was that a lot of the guards treated them like the inmates. Hopefully you don't experience that.",2,,2024-10-31 18:23:41,t3_1ggk6l4,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1ggk6l4/first_time_visitation/luqhqr3/

So we made the choice to disclose to family friends, which means they can come and hang out here or we can go to their house. We have not told others, which means if their kids come to play, husband leaves the house for the entire time. 
We won't do sleepovers with other kids and only have a small circle of adults we trust. I accept that the risk is never zero now, but that generally safe people do exist and know of warning signs (like those who are ""so great"" with kids...). 

I feel you on navigating it. Before all this, I wanted to be the safe house for all our friends kids, turns out we may have to settle for the young adult years instead.

luh6n1t,comment,,"That sounds very worrisome.  I did 5 years 2012\~2017 for receipt of CP, and I knew plenty of people in prison that I KNEW would be back.  We all did really lol.  They couldn't even help themselves while IN PRISON.  They'd write backstories for their d&d characters that were basically CP fanfiction, or one guy had a freaking collage of pictures cutout from magazines, of kids.  That's not necessarily illegal but it's extreeeeemely stupid and dangerous, especially in prison.  If anyone from another group had seen it he would've been run off the yard so fast.

When did he go in/for how long?  It's possible he wanted the phone for non-CP stuff, like if he's young and is used to having a phone and being on it 20 hours a day.  Even if that's the case, it's still a big red flag and he's in real danger of being sent back.

How long does he have to be phone-less?  And I assume other electronic devices?  Here in NV we can have smart phones, videogames, computers, etc., and just need monitoring software.  Though they can't put it on videogames, I think if your PO doesn't think you'll abuse it they don't care.  Plus we have to take polygraphs 1-2x a year so it's not like I could hide anything.

If his phone-lessness is only temporary, AND he doesn't want it for CP purposes, he just needs to suck it up for a few months or however long until his PO gives him some privileges back.  If it's going to be for years...he's going to need more help, a lot more.

Does he have court-ordered therapy?  I had group therapy for the first year after I got out, then only had to do 1 on 1 sessions.  But every day in group we went around the circle and talked about how we were doing, and there were guys struggling w/ their addiction every few days.  Our therapist gave them various tools and advice on how to combat it, and they could share w/ the group how those worked.  Something like that could be very helpful to your friend.  There also might be people there that have been exactly where he is, messed up, and been sent BACK to prison.  Someone like that can help put it in perspective for him as well.

This reddit is very similar to group, but I think him having someone right in front of him telling him what a colossal mistake he's making and how huge an impact it is, is a good idea.

I had \~7 months in a halfway house once i got out of prison in late 2017, and a few months after I got out, I got a message from someone I knew in prison.  He had just gotten to the halfway house as well and wanted to chat.  I knew I wasn't supposed to, but we text and talked on the phone a few times.  He wanted to hang out but I told him no.  He wasn't even supposed to HAVE a smartphone in the halfway house, not yet anyway.  You had to get a job first and then have a note from your boss that a phone would help you at work (which everyone was able to get).  We also had the same PO, so it was all around a bad idea to talk to him heh.

He told me he had gotten into it with his PO already, and was worried they'd find his phone, since he basically had to hope he didn't get searched on his way into the halfway house.  I told him to ditch it if he thought he was under the microscope.  Not like he had an expensive one or anything, just some $100 or less thing.  Well, he didn't listen to me, and next thing I know my PO's at my place asking why I was communicating with him.  I told my PO I knew I shouldn't have, but that my friend was having trouble and I was just giving him some advice.  Luckily, none of our text messages were anything to worry about.  BUT, it turns out my friend had also used his phone to download...computer generated porn?  I didn't quite understand if it was adults or CP or what, my PO didn't want to get into the details.  But he said it was a big violation, both having the phone and whatever he had on there, so he lost his halfway house time and was sent back to prison and had to finish out his \~5 months there.

Months later, I met another guy I knew from prison at my therapist's office (they handle all the SOs here in Vegas, small world!) and asked him if he knew what happened, since i assume he went back to the place we were at, Safford AZ.  He told me that my friend told everyone I had gotten him caught lol, and didn't mention all the stuff he screwed up.  He must've been super embarrassed and didn't want to fess up heh.

Make sure your friend knows that even if he's not using a phone for porn, that he can STILL be violated and sent back to prison for one",3,,2024-10-30 05:14:20,t3_1gfct08,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gfct08/compulsion/luh6n1t/

lui6jmd,comment,,"Thank you for your response.  Here are some answers in response to some of your questions: He’s under the impression that his lack of phone will be for a long time.  His PO seems like a hard ass and not helpful.  Per his report, he’s not into csam, it was just a part of his sexual addiction.  He was on his phone constantly prior to prison (2 years in prison) so while I’m not sure if he was looking up porn, he was being cagey about being on his phone at all. He was in group therapy prior to prison and will be mandated back to prison….however I think he doesn’t have much hope.  I think he thinks it won’t help.

Part of me wonders if he has such a poor attitude because at 37 years old, he just doesn’t want to change.  It feels like the more I try to help, the more he digs his heels in. I don’t want to abandon my childhood friend during the worst time of his life but I also don’t know how to handle this.  I have a professional background in mental health but not this.  I’m just trying to understand

Also NY state is stricter for probates in my opinion, I did some years in NY but eventually moved to the Midwest for work and got my probation transferred.

lu98ep9,comment,,"It really depends. Some places in Europe have therapy for those with urges who have not yet offended and also for those who have offended. Also, the issue is that in the USA, therapists are required by law to notify authorities of certain things especially when it comes to child exploitation. I remember watching a German documentary about sex offender therapy and how they are treating those who have not yet offended and the German doctor mentioned that in Germany, they do not have such a requirement to notify authorities whereas in the USA  they do. This requirement stops most from seeking help. 

The other unfortunate part is that in the US, everything is a business. Including Prison. The Prosecutors business is to win cases and get people in prison to look good for their voters or general public. Putting a sex offender behind bars earns a lot of good points for them politically. They cannot really do that if said person receives needed therapy beforehand. 

Lastly, is really the stigma behind it. Again, most European countries believe that people with these urges should have therapy available. Whereas in the US many think that someone even admitting to having an urge is just as guilty as someone committing the act.",19,,2024-10-28 22:45:42,t3_1gedhi0,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gedhi0/something_ive_noticed_lately/lu98ep9/

lu8xga7,comment,,"I don’t think there’s one reason for it. 

One part of it is the stigma around such urges. People fear admitting they have these thoughts will have them barred from society, from friendships to job opportunities. So most will hide them and not come forth.

Another part of it is it’s hard to get therapy for it unless you’ve committed a crime. You won’t know which therapists are open to treat these urges, and which ones will turn you away (which does happen frequently).

As for the parents, some might try to help, but they are limited in the same reasons above (they don’t know their child has these urges, or they don’t know who to reach out to for help). Maybe they try Church, or stricter parenting, which might or might not help.

And throughout all this, there’s also a big component of possible denial, as admitting to such urges is hard to come to terms with.

So in an interesting way, society’s demonizing of these urges actually makes it harder to treat, as we don’t know who has these urges and they are fearful to come out and confront them. Granted, I don’t think society is wrong for condemning these attractions, but we should be more sympathetic to non-offenders that want to get medical help, as they’ve committed no crime (which means they’ve not viewed any material or touched a child).

If they just have thoughts, they shouldn’t be afraid to speak out and get help for it early. I feel the same for people who have homicidal thoughts or similar violent urges, that we should respect they want to be treated and assist them. 

Though if the person in question has crossed the line from thoughts to crime, they deserve legal punishment. The severity of the consequences is another conversation.",4,,2024-10-28 21:46:14,t3_1gedhi0,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gedhi0/something_ive_noticed_lately/lu8xga7/

lu90r7q,comment,,"Texas is particularly harsh with sex offenses and they make it very difficult to ever get removed from the registry. I don't mean to discourage you, but things might get tough. Work hard to get deferred adjudicated there (and ensuring he never offends again) because that will make a huge difference.

As for staying with him, you don't have to make that decision now, but it is not something you should consider lightly. My wife stayed with me (it has been over 25 years now), and I am extremely grateful that she did, but I don't know if I would ever recommend it. She has been through so much over the years, including legal and many other expenses, the shame of being on the registry and having to explain it to neighbors, limitations on housing and employment, and just the exhausting years of me dealing with my issues. 

In her fifties now, she has been beaten down and is weary with life, and I wonder how different she would have been having spent those years with someone else (or even alone!). At this point, although I am in love with her as ever, it is clear the feelings aren't mutual, which is really a disservice to us both. 

One thing that would have made a difference for us is aggressively dealing with pornography. I dealt with my main issues but never completely dealt with pornography and relapsed many times over the years. Although I no longer use pornography, I pay for a monthly service (truple.io) that monitors my devices (blocking alone DOES NOT work). I do this not for, but as evidence for her that I have nothing to hide. 

C P is often accompanied with a severe pornography addiction so he has that to deal with along with any underlying issues. Blocking, monitoring, a strong support network, and intensive therapy is the only sure way for him to get beyond this. It won't just go away, and dealing with it on his own just doesn't work. 

Again, you don't have to decide now whether to stay with him or not, you can at least help him through this and address that later--you do have a right to leave. But if you do stay, that's a major and very unpleasant commitment. I convinced my wife to stay mostly for selfish reasons, and in the end may have lost her anyway.",5,,2024-10-28 22:03:29,t3_1ge83bo,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1ge83bo/what_to_expect_going_forward/lu90r7q/

I represent indigent individuals convicted of sex offenses at hearings to determine their ""risk of sexual recidivism"" upon completion of their sentence.  aka, I am a public defender who represents people at the court proceeding where their ""risk level"" is determined for sex offender registration purposes.

The bare fact of his conviction WILL cause obstacles to reentry.  any helpful criminal legal system legislation is probably inapplicable to him because of his offense of conviction.  that being said - there is a lot he can do, depending on TN's precise laws, to try and mitigate the harms of registration (which appears to be automatic and not subject to any sort of hearing in TN).

  
I would encourage him to partake in prison programming and ANY opportunity for sex offender-specific counseling.  In my experience, SO treatment response is generally the factor most valued by the courts when considering someone's registration status (other important variables consist of housing and employment stability, family support \[which he clearly has!\], advanced age, new health conditions, deepened religious beliefs, comprehensive re-entry strategizing, and substance abuse treatment (where applicable), among many more).  so, if he one day wants to request termination of his registration (note - I am not sure whether he is eligible for this, I did not check), or moves to a state where registration status is based on risk of reoffense determined after a hearing, successful completion of treatment is invaluable, as is a forensic evaluation opining a low risk of reoffense.

  
However - i specifically wanted to respond to this post because of the housing question.  I would carefully look at TN's registration laws to determine if there are any housing restrictions put on individuals with SO convictions.  if so, it is possible that your home could be incompliant with said laws, and he would not be permitted to live there upon release.

  
I do not practice in TN so I cannot say what the applicable law requires, however, in my state, I have represented numerous individuals who have family members, for instance, that own homes and offer housing, but the address is ""denied"" by parole/probation for failure to comply with laws restricting residency.",2,,2024-10-29 14:43:00,t3_1ge83bo,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1ge83bo/what_to_expect_going_forward/luctlnh/

lu7n1q6,comment,,"I’m sorry you’re going through this. It will be tough. The extent of how bad depends on the plea deal. They have their charges (in Virginia) based on how many images they charge you with. I think the magic number was 3. So if it’s below 3 they tend to go with probation. Above that almost certain jail time. As for talking to a minor, that’s bad I’m afraid. They tend to try and make it worse for offenders. So people in my group who went to meet someone, they make them go to another state (in this case dc) in order to add federal charges. 
Federal is a lot tougher and has very high minimum sentences.

Then from there it was triggering events, such as meeting the lawyer and finding out the plea deal and how he was getting a ten year sentence, may get out in 7. Then going to sentencing and hearing even more things and then the marshals taking him away. Then the transfer to his destination. He’s been at his final destination about two weeks and when he calls he seems good as he can be and safe. My path has been extremely difficult and I’ve had to take steps back because I was losing myself in this process. Now that he has been gone, I’ve been able to really start healing. I know some stay and some decide to leave and I support both. This has been truly the hardest thing I’ve ever been through, and I’m been through some shit.

I strongly suggest that you be truthful about your charges. Things have changed from decades ago and there are a lot of sex offenders in federal prisons. I served at two different lows and the only time I know of a SO getting beat up just for being a SO was when one lied about his charges. When the group he was hanging with found out the truth, the beat him up in the rec yard one day. After that he got transferred to another prison. As long as you mind your own business and are respectful to everyone, no one will harm you. You may overhear some comments from other inmates, but just ignore them. The SOs mostly hang together and eat in the same section of the chow hall. You definitely won't be alone. 

One thing I did before I went in was to make a list of the phone numbers and email addresses of all my friends and family, and then had someone send it to me in the mail once I got established. I would also suggest renewing your driver's license if possible before you go in.

lu7ir61,comment,,"FYI, when I self-surrendered to the federal low, they refused to take my cash to put on my commissary account (I'd imagine a commissary account didn't exist for me at that time, so even if they wanted to, they couldn't). I'd suggest you take only your identification.

First day, I was in a holding area for an hour or so, until I was called to meet with the counselor for the prison dormitory I'd been assigned to.  He told me to keep my crime to myself, but if asked to claim I was in for mail fraud (bad advice because it doesn't match the time I was doing).  I was then sent to the next room, where a medical staff member asked me my crime.  I told him, and he wrote it down.  Later in the year, it was brought up to me by a nurse who asked if I'd ever touched anyone (I hadn't, I was a porn criminal).  So, in hindsight, I'm guessing I wasn't supposed to tell the medical staff member anything about my crime.  I dunno. That whole situation seemed a trifle weird.  Was it a lesson for socially-inept fools like myself, to keep my mouth shut? Or was it that the medical staff member was being nosy and spreading my info around out of malice?

\----

Random Anecdote:

Later that year, I was in line for breakfast and I saw someone get handed a bowl of regular cereal instead of the oatmeal being given to everyone else and I asked for the same.  When he refused me, I got offended because I thought he just being a dick.  Turns out he had made the effort to acquire that bowl of cereal for his friend, held on to it until he came through line, and gave it to him.  I didn't realize that's how things worked in limited resource environments (such as prison), and risked causing a fight out of ignorance.

\----

Some of the regrets I accrued during my stint in federal prison:

* Saying too much that first day.
* Not coming in with a proper cover to match the time I was doing (the counselor's proffered cover was flimsy at best).
* Saying too much about where I got my game of scrabble (bought it from another inmate who probably stole them from the prison).  It probably didn't matter, but still. One shouldn't spread info about other people's business unless you hate them.  We can all operate easier when our potential opps lack information about our activities.
* Not recognizing the reality of low-resource environments, where people look out for their friends. I was expecting equal treatment from strangers.

Things I didn't regret:

* Avoiding getting sucked into a porn group. There was a group of sex offenders that (reportedly) got together to reminisce about their favorite (illegal) porn series.
* Getting gifted a prison hustle by a friendly person.  Dude basically passed off his typing hustle to me.  I don't remember his name, only his face.  He was a good dude.",1,,2024-10-28 17:32:07,t3_1ge604t,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1ge604t/noon_question/lu7ir61/

lu800ic,comment,,"Probably worse in terms of crowding. It got more and more crowded, and there were less 2-man cubicles when I left than when I went in.  (3-man is the same as 2-man, but with an extra bunk to put it over capacity).

Possibly better in terms of electronic devices (I've heard from a friend that he, a federal sex offender with three strikes, was permitted a tablet).

And possibly better in that sex offenders are in prison in larger numbers (as agents of the justice system accrue stronger tools with which to locate & prosecute porn offenders), so that there's less odds of an individual sex offender having problems while incarcerated.

Also, rules were always changing.  My theory is that the changes were a prison management technique, so that the inmates couldn't set up any sort of framework corruption that would last all that long without forcing adaptation & risk of exposure.  Or it could be that wardens just love to play at social experiments.  Dunno.",3,,2024-10-28 18:57:40,t1_lu7vrx0,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1ge604t/noon_question/lu800ic/

Don't do it. Find some other sort of porn to get yourself off. You don't want to be living in fear of getting caught. It's a virtual nightmare. For the record, I con't consider myself to be a pedophile. I let my porn habit go out of control when i tired of every type I was looking at.

lu83f4o,comment,,"Understanding your triggers is the first step. Like any addiction, it will only go away slowly. Don't give in to the desire. When you feel triggered, remove yourself from the situation and imagine how badly your life will change if you continue. After time, the triggers will come less often.
Like quitting tobacco: The first couple of days are hard. The next weeks  are a struggle. After a month, you still have urges, but they are now coming less often. After a year, you still have the occasional urges, but they are shorter and less frequent. These are manageable if you just relax and think and relax. Don't give in. But even after several years have lapsed, even though the urges are less and less frequent, they do occur. Just stay away from them. The longer you do, the easier they become to manage.

Again, if off paper, don't let them in your house, or even look inside. Step out outside and close the door behind you.

Personally; they’ve always been ultra polite and professional. In one town, they asked if I had any issues with neighbors and gave me the card of the detective who was “in charge” of the RSO program. If I am the one at home I remain polite and say have a good day. They’ve always been respectful.

I'm in UK and have an ongoing case for 2yrs. Should have gone to county court for sentencing last week but it was cancelled and moved to the end of november.  Stressed to the max with it all.


My solicitors useless, seen them.in person 2 times. Once when 1st arrested and othertime to sort out legal aid.!  When I went to county court my solicitor arranged a barrister to see me. She basically said I'm looking at 4-6yrs unless I plead guilty which may reduce it to 2yrs.   This was a total shock to me as my solicitor said its probably 2yr suspended sentence. I went straight into panic mode, felt all alone with no help so I pleaded guilty there and then. Wanted it all over with ive lost the will to fight. 


I've since had presentence report and now I'm waiting around again bit knowing what will happen. Feel like life's on pause, unable to kove forward with my life.


I've started private counseling aswell as Talking therapy with NHS and both are helping me so much to understand and to prevent further actions. Yet I know it won't happen again as I've screwed my life up,friends and family etc.. I've learned from my mistakes.  I'm not the same person that got arrested 2yrs ago,but I don't think the law will take that into consideration.",3,,2024-10-28 16:07:14,t3_1gdq80s,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gdq80s/just_under_two_years_got_court_in_around_two/lu71qd7/
lu407zs,comment,,"I’m a spouse, well ex spouse but I stuck around for close to two years until his behaviour meant I couldn’t any more. It wasn’t the offence, it was other stuff. So I have some idea of what is likely to happen.

In the uk, you are highly, highly unlikely to go to prison for a first offence of iioc. My ex had nearly 2000 images between cat a, b and c and animal images. He got a year suspended for 2 years, 10 years on the register, a 10 year SHPO, and a 3 year community order as well as £145 court costs. Court costs are usually much higher but my ex was homeless, living in his car, at the time of sentencing. The SHPO was minimal, just letting the police look at all devices on request, not deleting internet history, and registering every new device. There’s also some talk by probation about having monitoring software on his phone and laptop but they keep umming and aahing because he’s got pay as you go and a dongle for the laptop - apparently it will cause problems if you keep running out of data.

I got my ex into therapy, specifically sex offender therapy and they’re now doing work on his childhood. We found her through STOPSO. It’s £80 a session but he seems to be getting something from it. I also encouraged him to do the inform plus course with the Lucy Faithfull foundation, it costs £800 but he found it so useful. It helped him understand the thought process that led to this path and gave him tools to change his thinking. I also did the inform course, for relatives, which was free, and also very useful. I pushed for him to go to sex addicts anonymous but he declined.

I hope I’ve helped, and I hope things get better for you.",4,,2024-10-28 01:48:10,t3_1gdq80s,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gdq80s/just_under_two_years_got_court_in_around_two/lu407zs/

I know the judicial process is mind-numbing and seemingly detached but it is what it is. The backlog of equipment needing to be forensically checked is ridiculous these days and that does not help. Your solicitor is probably right, your crown case will prob be set for the new year. 

I know it easy to sit here and say that you need to put it to the back of your mind, I have been there, (Sadly a few times.) but what is going to happen will happen whether you worry or not. It seems to be dragging at the moment but it will pass quickly and once it is over you will wonder where it all went, believe me.

Be upon or remain on the premises of any building or grounds of any public school, private or parochial school, licensed day care center, other child care facility, public park, playground, recreation center or public athletic field available for use by the general public in this state when the offender has reason to believe children under 18 years of age are present;",1,,2024-10-28 03:22:07,t1_lu2egwc,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gd9tik/halloween_in_tn/lu4ek9r/

A bit off topic, but for clarification on my use of ""agent"" here. They used to be called parole officers.

The *law* does not say that dressing up with your child is a valid defense. Some some attorney might have said it. But “a defense” means it’s made it to court. I don’t think I’d want to get to that point.

lu4belq,comment,,"I’m just answering your questions and telling you what I’ve seen / have direct knowledge of happening in TN. 

The exclusion zone map is no longer accurate, it hasn’t been updated in years. They straight up tell you not to use it without checking on your own because it’s inaccurate. If the church offers childcare of any kind then you can’t *legally* be there “when children / minors / under 18 are present.” 

Call your local sheriffs department and ask them if they enforce that law with church daycares. I know for an absolute fact that Shelby, Davidson, Rutherford, Williamson, Wilson, Hamilton, Knox, Blount, Sevier, Bradley, Rhea, and Polk counties have enforced that. I would guess that they all do since it’s state law. 

I don’t know if the police would do anything or not, I can’t imagine that they wouldn’t show up. Tennessee has an entire operation literally targeting RSO’s every Halloween season. I’m certain they’d question you, ask for ID, etc… I can’t imagine how that would feel for you or your kid in the middle of a trunk or treat event. It’ll really be up to the Sheriff / PD and how they choose to enforce the law where you are. 

It doesn’t really seem all that arbitrary that a church would not allow RSO’s at an event for children where constant contact / interaction is involved. Most churches have pretty hard fast rules on RSO’s attending services and not being allowed to attend events that are for children is definitely one of those.",1,,2024-10-28 02:59:55,t1_lu1r5to,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gd9tik/halloween_in_tn/lu4belq/

Also spoke to the Mexican consulate as well as the Honduran embassy and was told that as long as I have appropriate travel documents and was not a felon or on the registry, I would not be denied entry/or detained.

Am wondering if you were showing up on a registry somewhere? I lived in California, Washington and Nevada, and I did a search for myself on all 3 states and nothing, might also be because my offense was 24 years ago? No national registry search either, nor do I have an fbi number or arrest record, so maybe that's it? Idk.

Just curious.",0,,2024-10-27 07:13:44,t1_ltxz7n4,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gd00sb/nonregistered_travel/ltz4qpu/

ltrid3m,comment,,"I was in a phoenix transfer facility for 4-5 weeks.  Not sure if it was a holdover or what.  It was a medium prison, but our section was completely separate.  The only time we ever even saw an inmate from the medium was when we all trekked down to the chow hall in a line, kindergarten style, and there was a guy just relaxing at a table.  He saw us and went ""Oh crap!"" and ran back to the kitchen.  My guess is they all know they need to clear out when we come to eat lol.

I don't remember if we had phone access or not...I feel like we did.  I remember the phones were out in a hall, and we couldn't just go whenever we wanted, since a guard had to supervise, which was just leaving the door open to their little cubby really.  The library was also accessed from the hall, and...maybe something else, I forget.

It was pretty relaxed though, since it's mainly people waiting to go to their designated spot, so no one's really in a group yet, there's no politics or anything.  Can be boring, we only had one tv, an hour in the morning for rec, and then that was it.  There was room for like 100 people but we only had 50 at most, no one used the other dorm area.  Not for sleeping anyway, people would go walk laps around in there lol",2,,2024-10-25 23:05:57,t3_1gc34cb,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gc34cb/what_is_a_holdover_unit/ltrid3m/

ltq234q,comment,,"To put it bluntly, I’d be livid if my husband even hinted at being upset with me or tried to hold me back when I want to travel. 

I didn’t commit a crime. I live with, and don’t complain to him about, all of the restrictions involved because of the fact that he did. 

I deal with the rules, not being able to live where I want to, attending things alone (when everyone else’s spouse is there) that I wish he could be there for, visits from the Sheriffs office, my home being searched, having to vigilantly lock up things that he can’t have access to, taking on more responsibilities because there are things he can’t do, being the primary breadwinner because he’s been unable to find a job that pays more, knowing my house is listed on the registry, not ever feeling comfortable having people over to visit, not even feeling comfortable giving my address to people lest they google it and find out, being unable to participate in Halloween, not being able to do most of the activities I did previously unless I do them alone, the constant fear and worry, etc…  I do that every single day without complaint. 

It would absolutely not be fair to ask me, and is not fair to ask her, not to travel because he can’t. I already feel sad and and usually guilty (even though I shouldn’t) when I do things that he isn’t allowed to. With everything that I give up and deal with, and as much as I hate to admit it, I’d probably snap and would definitely resent him if he pushed back when I want to travel. 

I get feeling left out. I understand being sad about it. But there’s no reason in this world to try to limit what your wife and children can do because you’re not able to. 

My guy puts a smile on his face, even though I know he’s disappointed he can’t go, drives me to the airport, hugs and kisses me, and tells me to have a great time.",43,,2024-10-25 18:18:52,t3_1gbzjve,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gbzjve/wife_kidsand_travel/ltq234q/

One of my biggest frustrations in my relationship is knowing that my partner and I *technically* can fly anywhere for free, but I can’t take him to many of the places that I usually travel to because he’s on the registry. I want more than anything to show him all of the beautiful places that I’ve been, but unfortunately it just isn’t in the cards at the moment. 

I know that this sucks. I often feel horrible when I post pictures running around different continents and know that my partner sees it. That being said, I always make it a mission to buy him something while I’m away. Not like a magnet or a shot glass with the name of the city I was in—something specific that you can’t get anywhere else. Something that allows him to experience the city or the culture. Anything to make him feel like he gets to be a part of that adventure. 

What I’ll say is this— let her go on every adventure. Let her explore the world. But also ask her to bring you something back so that you can be a part of it too.

I suggest processing this and talking it out with ANYONE ELSE other than your wife because your feelings are always valid. It's normal to feel sad and maybe even depressed that you get left out of these things. It's not your wife's fault, she didn't cause it. She shouldn't be expected to give up travel because you can't go too. 

I think the suggestion of a yearly US vacation with the family is great, it means you still get to make memories with your kids. And deep down, maybe that's the sadness - missing out on those core memories.

However, Mexico probably won't let you come ashore. Since you're in Florida, I think you should be able to sail to the Bahamas without issue but for that I think you'll need a passport.

Looking at cruises, you can go to Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. Stay on the ship at ports that won't let you onshore.

The fact he refuses to let you see it makes me angry. He’s clearly not being honest or forthcoming with you and you absolutely deserve that. 

There are many, many studies (that I’m happy to send you if you’d like) which show that victims of sexual abuse by a step parent or other family member tend to minimize, not embellish, what they went through out of embarrassment and / or fear. Does that mean she didn’t make anything up at all? No, sometimes memories are skewed. We don’t all remember the same events the same way.   But, studies show that it is exceedingly rare for those victims to “make things look worse.” I’m not saying it never happens, but most studies show it’s only around 2% of the time. 

But, she’s not his “ex girlfriend” and it was not consensual - a minor, especially one who is your stepchild, absolutely cannot consent.  She was his step daughter whom he molested. It wasn’t a relationship. 

You are not selfish if you choose not to stay.  He is neither your responsibility or your problem. You didn’t cause this, you didn’t allow it, you are in no way whatsoever at fault.

Also the fact he cheated on his previous wife with her daughter. There is a reason he doesn’t want you to read the report. If he s being honest he can always tell you what parts of the report is not true. My partner is a RSO, he was falsely accused, but he had no problem of me digging into his past, reading the convictions and allegations, and he told me everything on his side of what was true and what was not true so I can decide for myself if I wanted to keep dating. 
I think this story hit a little more to me cos I was in a relationship like this previously, where my ex was still sleeping and cheating on me with his previous ex, and denied having anything going on with anyone else, made it seem like I was crazy/jealous to think of it (despite finding blonde hair on his clothes, and I am not blonde). My gut feeling was strong but my heart said otherwise.

You do *not* have relationships with minors. Anybody who says they do needs a lot of therapy, and chances are it won't work, because that person is incapable of being honest with themselves.

It's up to you whether you want to stay with this guy and work on forgiving him. I can't tell you, or anyone else, what to do.

ltpx3rj,comment,,"I spent more than a decade as a (volunteer) court and victims advocate for a rape crisis center.  “She was the aggressor,” was very frequently stated in court by the defendants. I remember *one* of those cases (a very rare and extreme case where the victim was a girl who’d also been SA’d by her bio father from the time she was very, very young, was homeschooled with no outside influences, no access to internet or television, and genuinely thought it was something she was *supposed* to do) where I almost believed that might be a possibility, but it still didn’t change the fact that the defendant was an adult. 

So many kids don’t report things that are embarassing. I held a lot of hands during a lot of rape kits / exams where there was very obvious evidence that things happened and the victim denied that it happened due to the embarassment. 

Granted, that’s personal experience / conjecture, but it aligns with all of the studies I’ve read that people tend to minimize what happened to them in CSA cases. 

I’m so sorry you’ve been put in this position. It’s incredibly unfair to you and a huge weight to carry.

We frequently have houses rejected that we know are eligible. We have to educate them on the law and restrictions that apply to the specific offender, and occasionally have to raise the decision to the supervisor to correct. This is their job and they should know the law better than we do.

We have some POs who apply their own interpretation of an offender's restrictions, rather than an objective interpretation. This is especially true with old cases where not all current restrictions apply.

Do not be lazy about granting permission for travel since it is often the difference between keeping a hard found job and losing it.

Be accessible. For some offenders it is nearly impossible to get in contact with their PO.

I’ve met some very understanding PO’s and I wish they had more of a voice when it comes to these laws and how they are applied.

Also, since you're studying to be a psychotherapist, I want you to keep in mind one thing that I _know_ is taught in colleges but seems to be forgotten once folks graduate: statistical probabilities for recidivism apply to groups, not individuals. A risk assessment tool that says 20% chance of reoffense doesn't mean this person will reoffend 20% of the time. It means that, given the factors identified, that they would be one of 20 to reoffend in a population of 100.

lttuey8,comment,,"1) I encourage you to learn about person first language.  Nobody who is required to see you is an “offender” — they are people who have been convicted of an offense.
2) Many people you see were harmed before they caused harm. 
3) Not everyone you see is guilty of some or all of the crimes they were convicted of (even if they pled guilty). 
4) You have tremendous power to impact someone’s family (for good or bad), for the long term. Use that power thoughtfully. 
5) Back to point (2), the world isn’t binary with victims and offenders. And within the populations of people harmed and people who have harmed, there are vast differences. 
6) By the time someone has been assigned to you, they’re often broken. You can help build them back up. 
7) Supervision should be more like helper/coach, providing tools and resources, rather than simply setting people up to fail and expecting the worst. 
8) Always treat people with dignity and never forget their humanity.",10,,2024-10-26 10:10:59,t3_1gbfpkb,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gbfpkb/im_a_po_what_do_you_wish_your_po_knew_or/lttuey8/
ltli0nk,comment,,"The most frustrating thing for me was the blanket rules that apply to everyone regardless of the type of crime. For example people in my group who had a hands on crime that didn’t have to do with online crimes and have internet restrictions. 
For me personally, I had a very professional and understanding PO. I was very grateful as I heard horror stories from people in my group. People under probation feel they are trapped and can’t do anything about it. 

A personal struggle for me was the restriction to my county even though the court order specified a much larger area. I’m boring and don’t go anywhere so I was okay, but didn’t understand why it was done. Perhaps an explanation would help.

ltopixe,comment,,"I’m not the SO- my husband is. I’m pretty sure he’s neurodivergent (undiagnosed). He asks A LOT of questions and was labeled “difficult” because of it. The probation officer told him it was because they thought that he was trying to look for loopholes. He is, but not in the way they think. He wants to know what loopholes they may use against him. Some of these rules and laws are very unclear and open ended and he wants to follow the rules to the best of his ability and he needs to ask clarifying questions to understand better. 

His officer is a woman who never even gave him a chance. She immediately jumps down his throat as soon as she gets frustrated (which is like immediately whenever they talk). He is wary of the system, has never been in trouble prior to this and in my opinion never should have been prosecuted like he was. All that being said, he’s understandably frustrated, wary, and nervous. He can come across as combative because he’s scared, not because he wants to cause trouble. We had to get her supervisor involved because she would threaten a violation every time she got upset and he didn’t respond exactly the way she wanted him to immediately. He didn’t do anything to warrant a legit violation and she knows it. I know there are some people who want to skirt the rules and cause trouble, but there are actually some out there who made a stupid mistake and genuinely don’t want trouble.   

Also, I know it’s the officer’s job to do random visits but is it possible to do them at a reasonable hour? His curfew is 6 pm (don’t even get me started on that). She changed it from 7 to 6 and refuses to put it in writing, even though he asked. The last home visit she did was after 9 pm. I have to be up super early for work and it was so incredibly disruptive to have someone show up that late on a work night. I don’t know if that’s part of the training or if it’s meant to catch people more off guard or what. I know she has a large caseload. 

Lastly, people have pets. She has told us she’s afraid of cats and dogs. Big dogs I can understand, but she freaks out every time one of the cats passed by her. If you hate animals, don’t get a job where you have to go into people’s homes. I’m not saying you need to be best friends with the animals, but don’t be so on edge that a cat briefly rubbing on you sends you into a tizzy.",4,,2024-10-25 14:10:08,t3_1gbfpkb,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gbfpkb/im_a_po_what_do_you_wish_your_po_knew_or/ltopixe/
ltmcnze,comment,,"A lot of people that come out of prison have a definite mistrust with all law enforcement, and are probably going to be pretty suspicious if not combative.  I don't expect you to be best buds or give SOs a ton of leeway, but try to remember that they've spent years hating authority figures.

Most SOs, ones with computer crimes anyway, are just eager to get their life back on track.  If they can successfully avoid porn (most are struggling w/ porn addiction ) they're probably not going to be much trouble at all.

One of the biggest struggles for SOs is having a normal life again.  I consider myself lucky, my first PO was fine w/ me playing videogames and even hooking up w/ random guys on grindr.  I'm pretty sure he had the authority to say no to any of that.  My second PO was shocked that I could play online games, that anyone here in Vegas could, and she freaked out.  She only lasted a month or 2 before needing to transfer/retire.  Even my polygrapher told me she was having tons of trouble here and couldn't take it.

I really like my current PO, mainly because she knows that I'm not going to be any trouble.  I have monitoring software on my PC and iphone, take polygraphs \~2/year, and she visits monthly.  I'd have to be all kinds of stupid and/or crazy to mess things up.",3,,2024-10-25 02:25:41,t3_1gbfpkb,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gbfpkb/im_a_po_what_do_you_wish_your_po_knew_or/ltmcnze/

In that context, explaining very clearly at the onset expectations.  If your goal is to help them to be successful, explain that and the way that it will look.

Greater compassion, empathy and understanding is definitely needed, especially given the hardships those with SOs subsequently face, including challenges being on the register, securing accommodation and employment, sustaining relationships and handling often widespread media coverage.",1,,2024-11-13 00:10:59,t3_1gbfpkb,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gbfpkb/im_a_po_what_do_you_wish_your_po_knew_or/lwu4gre/
ltoobup,comment,,"Thank you for wanting to reach out to PFRs (Persons Forced to Register). Even though, my fiancé never had any real issues with his POs during his 3 years of probation, it still should have been less stressful. The duties and responsibilities of Probation Officers are listed below, yet from all the posts I read, Probation Officers often don't step up to these responsibilities and rather try to monitor the person through fear and threats of violating them:

* Reviewing and assessing probationers’ background, history, and progress.
* Monitoring probationers’ activities and compliance with probation terms.
* Providing counseling and resources to help probationers make better choices and adjust to life after incarceration.
* Collaborating with social services providers to assist probationers with finding housing, employment, and education.
* Preparing and presenting reports on probationers’ progress to court officials.
* Working closely with law enforcement and legal representatives to ensure enforcement of probation terms.
* Responding to emergencies or violations related to probationers’ behavior.
* Testifying in court regarding the progress or violations of probationers.
* Conducting regular meetings with probationers to assess their progress and address any issues.

  
Especially, the counseling and resources for those on probation are not adhered to in my opinion. When have Probation Officers gone off course? They should do their jobs as required like the rest of us.

I wish you all the best and hope that you will be successful. Also, the people on these forum don't like to be called ""sex offenders"".

ltqc4a4,comment,,"Are you… actually telling a probation officer what their job duties are from a list you copy/pasted from the Internet? And telling them what you expect them to call the people under their supervision? And then speaking for our entire group? 

I don’t think any of the mods use the term PFR. Most of the people in the group don’t use it. Expecting people to use it will leave you disappointed, most of the time. 

You do realize that sex offender probation is vastly different from standard probation, right? “Offender” or “Ex Offender” would be quite confusing in that context. The rules are different. The treatment is different. The probation is different. 

I’m sure that PO’s know their job description. I’m sure there’s no standard across every department in every state. I’m sure there are some who aren’t good at their job, but the majority of people don’t sign up or stay on a job where they are overworked and underpaid, constantly being put in dangerous situations, trying to juggle an unmanageable caseload, literally always being on call, all the while being treated pretty poorly themselves. 

There are bad PO’s and there are unreasonable probationers, most people here don’t report having bad PO’s in threads where it is discussed. You see complaints from ones who do more often than you see compliments, and you see people who have unreasonable expectations or who are angry because they’re not allowed to do things complaining more than you see people with legitimately bad probation officers. 

We’ve had nothing but good ones. People who care about their job and may be strict, but have all been reasonable and kind. 

Probation isn’t supposed to be fun or stress free. Taking all that out and trying to “school” someone who is legitimately trying to help isn’t really appropriate.",3,,2024-10-25 19:10:20,t1_ltoobup,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gbfpkb/im_a_po_what_do_you_wish_your_po_knew_or/ltqc4a4/

ltk9913,comment,,"That’s a tough decision without any doubts. As a rso myself and being married to a wonderful woman. I can tell you what your boyfriend might be thinking about your relationship and future together. During the time of arrest, jail, and sentencing there were a lot of arguments between me and my spouse. I often felt guilty for my actions and felt depleted as a human. I wished that my wife would have left me at the time, but now I’m grateful that she stuck around. It really helped me knowing I had someone to trust and rely on. When certain negative life things pop up and it affects my wife bc of me being a rso. I feel extremely guilty from my actions and she is always reminded of the night I was arrested and charged. We’ve learned to adapt to life with my restrictions, it’s doable, but it takes a lot of online research, disappointing exceptions, and reality checks. We are still able to travel, but I have to look up each state or countries laws for registering. Before international travel I have to fill out a form with my personal info, travel dates, flight schedules, and where I will be staying.  I have to find flights with layovers in countries that allow rso’s. I had a layover once in South Korea, but they wouldn’t allow me in, so when I checked in they had to find a new flight for me that would work. I could go on and on, but right now YOU need to sit down and do some really hard thinking. Are you up for a life where your bf’s restrictions will affect you too? Are you up for others alienating both of you if they find out he’s a rso? Depending on where you live there may be additional restrictions and laws making it difficult for your bf to find a place to live, unable to get a good job. Are you ready to financially support your bf or future husband?",3,,2024-10-24 19:19:56,t3_1gb9ux3,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gb9ux3/dating_a_rso/ltk9913/

We were meant to meet up that weekend and spend our second visit together since dating. Unfortunately, that weekend he got the ankle bracelet. He ghosted me and made up some story about covid to cancel. He canceled the day I was supposed to drive to my flight. It crushed me. For a whole week he didn't communicate or talk to me. I tried so hard to reach out and had his coworkers tell me he came to work. No mention of being sick. Which was his reason for canceling. I understand that he thought it would be easier if I hated him and moved on. I just needed clarity as to why I was being pushed aside. When he finally did tell me, I stayed. I forgave him and we moved past it. I'm definitely willing to be there and help support him. I'm an independent person and I've supported myself alone for 5 years. I've expressed this to him. I want to be there for him and help him through it. He wouldn't be alone. I'm just not sure he's willing to allow me to be that backbone for him. I can't really say. I'm not inside his mind.

Edit to add:
Which applies?
Depending on the situation, either FERPA or HIPAA may apply—not both.

For the most part, community health care providers follow HIPAA and school providers follow FERPA. This is because schools that provide health care services generally document student health information in records that are considered education records, and are therefore covered under FERPA.

Student records covered under FERPA are excluded from HIPAA. If schools bill Medicaid for health services, they must follow HIPAA guidelines for those transitions, but the student health information maintained in education records is still excluded from HIPAA coverage.

School-based health centers operated by HIPAA-covered entities, such as a hospital or healthcare system, would be subject to HIPAA. If the clinic is operated by the school, then FERPA would apply.",3,,2024-10-25 02:00:28,t1_ltm7ja1,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gb8173/hipaa_question/ltm8n2r/

My last cruise with them was in 2019, so we are now scrambling to make new arrangements, since we were taking a transatlantic cruise from Barcelona. As far as Nassau, I was interviewed by the Nassau authorities on my arrival 2019, but I was allowed to enter the country.  I was denied entry in St. Kitts, but not in Aruba, Curacao or Cancun as a matter of fact. Something feels extremely unfair, when they allow you to board and then all of the sudden they discriminate against us as a class and deny boarding with no empirical data to support their claim.

""The Acts' registration, reporting, and surveillance components are not of a type that we have traditionally considered as a punishment.""

The court here says that simply having a registry is not unconstitutional. And the provisions of the Tennessee law that allow for the registry itself, and the information published on it, are ""constitutional.""

However, any additional conditions ""which mirror Michigan's 2006 and 2011 amendments to SORA, enjoined by _Snyder_, must fail.""

The court affirmed that some portions of the Tennessee registration law, which are like those that were considered unconstitutional in the _Snyder_ (Michigan) case, could be invalidated, but the lower court could not invalidate the entire registry (as it did in an earlier opinion).

But Director Rausch cannot be enjoined from enforcing provisions of the Act which he does not enforce—in fact, just to state the proposition highlights the circularity of such an injunction.

It is also questionable if Director Rausch can be forced to provide a remedy he is statutorily prohibited from providing. See Tenn.

In other words he can't do it under TN law  and we aren't allowed to because we don't have standing to remove a record.",1,,2024-10-24 18:05:56,t1_lti60je,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1ganfol/sixth_circuit_strikes_retroactive_application_of/ltjufbn/

ltpb986,comment,,"I had to speak to my partner’s PO before we started looking at starting a relationship. We had been speaking for a few months. It was just a short phone call and he said that he understands that we were friends and interested in dating. He asked my age (30’s) and if I had children (I don’t). He made sure I was aware that he was on parole and a general idea of why. Basically he asked me what I knew and was happy my partner was honest. He told me that a lot of times when he has these phone calls, the person has no idea about charges so it was refreshing. He asked me if I had any questions for him and said that if I ever needed support, there are resources for that. This is the one and only time his PO and I have spoken and it’s been over a year. 

As for his specific conditions on WHEN he was required to inform his PO and have him speak to me, I have no idea. 

The phone call was easy which I attribute to a few things:

1. My partner was honest with me and I went in already knowing the situation 

2. I don’t have children. If I did, I’m sure the conversation would have been much longer. 

3. My partner and I are both in our 30’s.

I work at a public defenders office and exclusively represent indigent individuals convicted of SOs in NYC for Sex Offender Registration Act (""SORA"") hearing, appeal, and modification purposes.  I'd be happy to talk to you - feel free to send me a message.

  
Briefly(ish):

When you move, you will have to self-identify to the Division of Criminal Justice Services (DCJS), which will then determine if you have to register here.  Given that your registration is required in MO, you will 100% be required to register if the offense of conviction is a felony.  If it is a misdemeanor, it depends on whether there's an equivalent registerable NY offense (there probably is).

  
Next - assuming registration is required - your case will be evaluated by the Board of Examiners of Sex Offenders, who will recommend you be a presumptive Level 1, 2, or 3, with 3 being the most restrictive (among other things, requires in person reporting every 90 days).  That recommendation will be forwarded to the court in the county where you reside, which will then schedule a SORA hearing, where the prosecution can make a different Level recommendation than the Board, and the Court makes the ultimate determination - which does not have to be in line with the Board/prosecution's recommendation (i.e. the court has the power to grant downward departures to Level 1).  you have the right to be represented by an attorney at the hearing, but should know that nearly all practicing criminal defense attorneys are insufficiently familiar with SORA, unless they specialize in it.  if you cannot afford an attorney, the court will appoint a public defender.  Because many public defenders' offices have SORA specialized teams, we are generally far more successful than privately retained attorneys who, in my experience, by and large have no idea what they're doing when it comes to SORA (with obvious exceptions for attorneys who specialize in this).  In any case - it is crucial that you have legal representation for your hearing and make sure that any attorney who does not obtain a favorable outcome immediately files a notice of appeal.

  
Once your level is determined, you will formally report once again to SOMU and will be informed of your specific registration requirements.

  
Probably the most important determinative factor in an NYC hearing is, unfortunately, the county wjere the hearing occurs.  Staten Island (Richmond County) and Queens are notoriously bad, Manhattan (New York County) and the Bronx are less bad, and Brooklyn (Kings County) is the least bad.  Therefore, upon initially moving here I would strongly recommend moving to Brooklyn and, if you cannot, moving to Manhattan or the Bronx.  I would avoid initial registration in Queens and Staten Island if at all possible and avoid Nassau County (Long Island) at all costs.  Once your hearing is done, you can move to whatever county in NY and it will not change your registration requirements.

  
As mentioned above - please feel free to message me if you have more specific questions, I am always happy to address any concerns and provide information.",3,,2024-10-29 15:05:55,t3_1gac6a1,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gac6a1/moving_from_missouri_to_nyc/lucxxg7/
ltd6f0s,comment,,"Sure, I can answer most of this. Your best bet would be to contact NYS SORA/SOMU in NYC. 
NYS SORA is 518-417-3384 8 am-4 pm EST
NYC SOMU 212-323-7101, 212-323-7102, 212-323-7105 9 am - 3 pm EST

Information can be found at doccs.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2019/12/frm3012c.pdf (download able PDF)  

I am not sure if they will honor your registry requirements from Missouri or if they will do their own assessment. Best to contact a NYS lawyer/NYS SORA/SOMU. 

Level 1 is 20 years from time of release from prison. Information is non-public. You don't have to provide workplace information (they will ask at SOMU and you can gently remind them that you are hopefully level 1) you need to provide internet identifiers for all levels and they will inform whoever you provide so if it's playstation/Xbox/Facebook/Instagram, expect to be deleted unfortunately. You have to go in for a picture every 3 years and you receive a letter once a year around your registration date that you have to mail back within 10 days. 

Level 2 is lifetime with a possibility to petition removal after 30 years. Information is public, they don't connect it to Google, but third party companies do connect to it and post to Google. You need to provide workplace address (if you are remote, list your remote location) registration requirements are the same for level 1. Every year mail back a letter and on the third year, go in for a picture. 

Level 3 is the same as level 2 except you can't be removed from registry and you have to go in every 90 days. 

NY is pretty tough when it comes to deciding on the scoring of SO's. I had a CSAM conviction but was made level 2.  You do have the option to petition for a downwards level departure once a year and if you go from 2-1, the 20 year clock doesn't restart. So even if you are made level 2 and 15 years later are brought to level 1, you would still only have 5 years left. They want to see ""progress"" with your life. Again, not sure if they will honor time spent on Missouri's registry. 

There are no residency restrictions for any levels, however you may have to notify schools (if you have kids) that you are registered if you are a level 2 or 3. 

People in NYC mind their own business. I have been registered as a level 2 for almost 2 years now. No one bothers me. I am about to start looking for apartments to rent in the city so pm me if you want to stay in touch And I can let you know how that goes lol.

lud0isr,comment,,"I replied above and am very happy to help anyone with NYS registration questions.  I am a public defender who specializes in SORA here in the city.

I can clarify a few things:

1. NYS will do its own assessment.
2. Level 1 is 20 years as long as you don't have a ""designation"" - if you are designated a ""sexually violent offender"" (happens automatically based on offense of conviction), ""predicate sex offender"" (have a prior SO conviction), or ""sexual predator"" (rarely used), the requirement is lifetime registration regardless of risk level.
3. Both Level 2s **and** Level 3s can petition for modifications of their risk level under Corr. L. 168-o(2).  The alternative - where Level 2s can petition for removal after 30 years - is rarely used because of the opportunity to use 168-o(2) far sooner with an identical ultimate outcome.  We see much greater success on modifications than we do at initial registration hearings.  Courts can issue downward modifications from a 3 to a 2, a 3 to a 1, or a 2 to a 1.
4. Under recent NY case law, it is highly unlikely your time on MO's registry would be honored (this is called nunc pro tunc registration and NY's highest court just held that it is not required).
5. (This is inapplicable to OP, but I am clarifying nonetheless in case others reading this see mistaken information) There ARE very strict residency restrictions in NY for individuals **convicted in NY** of a sex offense AND - the complainant was a minor or they are given a Level 3 at their hearing.  The law is called SARA and applies **only** while an individual is under supervision (probation/parole) by NYS.  SARA makes it incredibly difficult for people subject to it to get released from prison on time, because it is nearly impossible to find an approved address in NYC.  Often, people will be held at least a few weeks past their release date and released upon the opening up of a shelter bed, as that tends to be the quickest way to get out given the dearth of non-SARA-compliant addresses in the city.  By and large, this law does not get applied to people with convictions from foreign jurisdictions (i.e., any place other than NYS- including other states, territories, federal convictions, etc.).

ETA: I agree that the SOMU detectives are *relatively* chill.  However, they are very often incorrect about SORA's requirements and the actual directives of the law.  For instance, there have been numerous recent examples of SOMU detectives telling people they do not need to return to SOMU after their level determination, since they already completed their initial registration form.  However, the court specifically **does require** that an individual go to SOMU within 10 days of their risk level determination to formally register.  In this example, SOMU's inaccurate instructions can lead to extremely unfavorable outcomes, such as supervision violations or new charges based on registration non-compliance (this is unlikely in most circumstances where the violation is solely as described above, but does remain a real and legally permissible consequence).",1,,2024-10-29 15:19:28,t1_ltd6f0s,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gac6a1/moving_from_missouri_to_nyc/lud0isr/
ltdero3,comment,,"In an ideal world, every person would be entitled to a fair and harassment free workplace. 

Volunteering in reentry, a lot of my time is spent calling major employers to discuss their willingness to hire people with convictions. I spend about 10 hours a month on it. 

When I call, these are my selling points:

1. Loyalty
2. Lowers recidivism 
3. Tax credits
4. The requirement that they have a job while on paper generally lowers the turnover rate (training is the biggest expense most large companies have, they lose money training people, they need people to stay.)
5.  Bonding - federal, and some state, bonding programs that protects companies when they hire someone with a conviction. 
6. It gives them access to a larger pool of workers. 

I’m not defending anyone in either direction here, and I’m not saying I agree or disagree with anything listed, these are just facts. 

- They have to employ someone for a minimum of 1 year to recieve the tax credits. So there is, actually, an incentive to ensure that the workplace is fair and harassment free. I can’t promise they’ll all fix it, but talking to HR is smart to do when facing harassment.  

- I have, in the past, asked employers who pay people less (which, is not most of them, but there are some,) because they have conviction, why they do. The most common answers have been:

1. Bad experiences with people being re-arrested or quitting following training, thus a huge expense for them. 

2. To offset the cost in liability insurance. While the tax incentive should at least partially cover this, the tax credit is only good for one year. 

3. Depending on the industry, there are some companies where they cannot use people with convictions for certain jobs. As an example, a commercial HVAC company who employs a lot of the people from Reentry cannot use those people on certain jobs because the clients don’t allow it. Another example, when hiring RSO’s who have restrictions, there are places they cannot work at without violating those - schools, sometimes churches, sometimes rec centers, etc… it’s more work for the company to sort all that out which makes it more expensive for them. 

4. Many work with a “probationary period” mindset. Pay less to start, if they get through training or make it to a year then give them a raise. That lowers their financial risk. 

5. Because they can. 

6. Lack of employment history.

7. Lack of experience (which often means extra training and, in the beginning at least, a less effective employee. 

- After 1 year of employment, that tax credit is gone. The bond is gone. There’s no more incentive. So, with some companies, you have to prove yourself to be a valuable employee in that time period to keep that job. They’re not going to *say* that to you (if they have 1/2 a brain) but it’s true. 

- There are 9 groups of people they get the same tax credit for hiring. They don’t *have* to employ people with felony convictions to get it. So, it’s not always their primary motivation for hiring. They can just as easily hire someone who’s been unemployed for a year, a veteran, someone who has been receiving welfare services, etc… and get that same credit. 

- There was a Supreme Court case in 1974, Richardson vs. Ramirez, in which the court determined that disenfranchising convicted felons beyond their sentence and parole does not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. 

- There is no fundamental right protecting anyone from rudeness. There are protections against harassing or discriminating against people due to: 
Race
Color 
Religion
Sex, including pregnancy, gender identity, and sexual orientation
National origin
Disability
Age (40 or older)
Genetic information, including family medical history

Those things are protected, but none of us are protected from our own past or present actions. 

Being convicted of a felony does allow states to legislate the removal of several of your fundamental rights. 

That means states can remove your right to vote, your right to bear arms, etc… and that they do not have to provide equal protections. 

Until that changes, nothing changes. You really have two choices, adapt to it (by changing how you handle it, how you respond to it, by proving yourself just as or more valuable than any other employee there, etc…)  - or fight it on a Supreme Court level. The ACLU has been trying for years and years to fight it with occasional success, but the current fact remains that people do, and legally can, lose fundamental rights when they are convicted of crimes. 

The system beats people down and keeps them down. It’s hard to move forward when everything is against you. It’s hard to stay positive and handle things with dignity and grace when there’s a constant feeling of not being as good or as valuable as others because of something you did in your past. People will try to break you. They’ll push as far as they can. You can’t let them have the reaction that they want. Eventually, just like school bullies or bratty kids - that lesson we learned in elementary school circles back - they’ll stop (at least most will), when they don’t get the reaction they want. Be the better person, because all they’re doing is trying to prove that you’re not.",7,,2024-10-23 17:17:59,t3_1gackg6,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1gackg6/workplace_discrimination/ltdero3/

ltdcsqh,comment,,"You’re definitely not alone.

It’s important to take care of yourself - please do seek therapy as soon as you possibly can. Look for therapists who do general CBT but perhaps also specialize in sex addiction. You don’t want someone who only specializes in that area because you’re not going to therapy for that yourself, but I always recommend trying to find someone who has some experience in that area because generally, those therapists are a bit more open and familiar with the lines that get blurred in these situations (meaning you’re less likely to feel any judgement from the therapist). I’m not saying that your partner is a sex addict either. I have no idea what the charges are and I didn’t see your previous post… this is just advice that I give every person that is in need of therapy after their partner is arrested.

Admittedly, I think it might be a little bit easier to give more specific support or advice if I knew the charges. But trying to speak generally … it’s true that you are going to have people who choose not to be a part of your life if you remain in a relationship with him. You’re not alone now, you won’t be alone in the future, but your own inner circle will change. However, I like to remind people that none of our lives are static. None of our lives are standing still. We’re all part of a metaphorical river that’s dynamically changing every day. People come and go all the time, especially during early adulthood. So frankly, if these people weren’t going to bail on you for staying with him, perhaps they were eventually going to bail on you for some other reason. Not everyone stays forever. That’s okay. It hurts. It’s hard. And it’s okay. All of those things can be true at once. 

It’s going to be okay for both of you. Not today. Not for a long time. But like I said, neither of you are standing still. You’ll move through this and you’ll both come out on the other side.

As someone who lost everything and everyone almost as soon as the accusations started, it is extremely helpful for him to have at least one person he can believe in and rely on during the legal proceedings.

You’ve done a lot to give him the best opportunity with an attorney.  I would also strongly suggest some form of separate counseling for the both of you during this interim period.

Ideally you'd want to provide that kind of help before they offend. This isn't anything radical that I'm saying, it's well known that providing support and healing for people who have committed any crime helps stop future crime. That does not in any way mean they shouldn't be punished or downplay the severity of the crime. If they are still a threat and the crime committed is deemed heinous enough then they should remain in prison. It being my own child doesn't suddenly make anything different in a fundamental level. Id teach them how to recognize grooming and how to avoid harm and situations that would put them in harm, I also recognize that most abuse happens in the family and by people you trust, not by people on the registry.",1,,2024-10-31 19:31:47,t1_luqlne2,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1ga9971/im_in_love_with_an_accused_so/luqup1e/

ltah0e5,comment,,"I haven't seen any info about it being a transfer/holding center. He may be currently held in a place where he doesn't have regular access to a phone. I know some prisoners arriving at FCI Englewood were housed in the ""quarantine"" unit, and that unit was not assigned to the same phones as they had access to, which meant they couldn't make phone calls until they got moved to a less temporary cell. He may be in a situation like that. You could always try calling Lewisburg, but they are kind of notorious for not giving a crap.

After that, i started to get all sorts of things thrown into my yard. Trash. Animal poo. There were used tires one time. I used to have grown ass people ding dong ditch. My fence was spray painted once. By far, the worst was someone repeatedly throwing nails into my driveway.

Weirdly, one of my neighbors brought it to my attention before anything bad could happen the first time. She even helped me clean them up. The next day, they were back, but I knew what to look for. Now everyday when we leave, we check the driveway first. 

It took a few years, but eventually, it just stopped happening. I even got to know and make friends with some of my neighbors.

I'm over it it's so distant in my past that I really think about it. I have moved on with my life I have a good job and nice apartment nice car nice motorcycle good clothes and I'm over the whole situation. I hope you get community service but if you do get incarcerated you will get over that also.

ltc551n,comment,,"Uhhh can't your parents handle all this?  I was living w/ my best friends and their family for the last \~1.5 years before I went into prison for 5 years, receipt of CP.  I actually didn't tell them until the night before that I was going lol.  I mean, they knew I had been arrested and had an ankle monitor and stuff.  But I didn't want to be treated differently so...kind of waited til the last minute there.

Anywhoo, I obviously didn't pack or do anything.  I told my mom to just do whatever, but my friends or cousin could hold onto my videogames.  I gave my car to my aunt, who had been saying she wanted a cheap car to use because she had a gigantic gas guzzling suv.  It was a crap car with almost 200k miles but  ran fine.  She then used it like...once, and then it became a nest for neighborhood cats.  I believe it's STILL cat-central in her driveway some 15 years later lol.  My mom and some family came to pick up various furniture.  I didn't have a lot of stuff since I was sleeping in the living room, so it wasn't too bad.

I mean, this is pretty last minute for you (though it'd be tough to beat me!).  Try and get power of attorney given to one of your parents if you can, and you trust they won't open up a bunch of credit cards or something.  Then you can just leave your keys and tell them to do whatever they can.

Also, like someone else mentioned, you're definitely in the roughest part of the whole process.  It took almost 3 years from my raid to going into prison and that was a lot of not knowing what was going to happen and when.

Probably don't want to hear it, but 2 years will fly by.  Everyone with me at my place had 5+, with them being in the minority.  In fact, try not to talk about it too much it might make people made lol.  It's obviously going to be a giant difference in lifestyle, since most people that get CP crimes aren't prison-types.  They're mostly people from everyday walks of life.

As opposed to say, all the people I knew there for drug charges that knew and dealt with people that did time frequently.  They know all about it (or what they were told anyway) and are pretty much planning on being back after they get out.

I'm an extremely laid back and stress-free person, so I can't really relate to the crying/screaming/giving up, but there's definitely still a lot of opportunities and you should have hope for the future.  Even if you can't continue with whatever field you were working in, even if all your friends and family shun you after, there's plenty you can do.  While you're away, think about what sorts of things you'd like to do.

I kind of spent my 5 years just killing time.  Playing games and gaying it up.  Now, I'm working on writing a book and really wishing I had started it while I was away.",0,,2024-10-23 13:16:59,t3_1g9ezbd,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1g9ezbd/struggling_at_the_moment/ltc551n/

When I was first arrested I couldn't go back to the family home as it involved a neighbour. Due to not being at home it destroy my relationship with my ex of 12yrs, I had to get a little flat to live in. I've built my life back up the past 18months as I've been awaiting outcome and I feel like I'm now going to loose my life again.",1,,2024-10-22 19:12:33,t1_lt7dp3h,,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1g9ezbd/struggling_at_the_moment/lt7wt4o/

lw5lzii,comment,,"Remember this convo that's your calling right there. I was in your shoes with a crazy case facing 25 to life then I prayed I had a dream psalm 66 so I said the day before court lord im scared i need a better sign then boom got john:4 48-51. Court day, the judge and prosecutor can't talk normally, 3 cap charges just vanished to a lesser one, no mention of anything. I got a bond 75k, and my family broke, but mom had a dream. One 1week prior while fasting, she saw 4 piles of money.  2 days later, 4 people came and gave her more than the 7.5k bond got paid the same day. 1y later I got offered 20y pastor said signed because even Coby couldn't get out i said nah i waited for my God then 14y then 10y I had trial on Oct 28th prosecutor canceled now we got no new date she said she want to do a plea deal instead now she say 5y I've been on probation for the last 2y. I said no again because God told me to stay still now she's afraid she going to lose I'm not faze. I predicted everything before it happened my mom was telling me in the jail phone that dont worry God already show her 7y ago this gon happen and ill be free that was my calling to stop living a bad live glad this happened to me. Jesus ain't no joke fam seek him like u seek money and pleasure.
